 Abstract In view of the progress made in recent decades in the fields of stemmatology

 and the analysis of geometric diagrams, the present article explores the possibility of

 establishing the stemma codicum of a handwritten tradition from geometric diagrams

 alone. This exploratory method is tested on Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on the Shape of

 the Eclipse, because this work has not yet been issued in a critical edition. Separate

 stemmata were constructed on the basis of the diagrams and the text, and a comparison

 showed no major differences. The greater reliability of a stemma codicum constructed

 on the basis of the diagrams rather than the text of a mathematical work is discussed,

 and preliminary conclusions are drawn.

 1 Introduction

 In recent decades, the history of science has witnessed two important, parallel move

 ments. First, a growing interest has been taken in visual data, notably the geometric

 diagrams that illustrate mathematical texts. The second trend is the recent transfer of

 the techniques of cladistics, used in the field of biological taxonomy, to stemmatol

 ogy with the aim of establishing the genealogical tree of a work by comparing its
 manuscripts (stemma codicum).

 In view of the advances made in these two domains, this article poses the question

 as to whether it would be possible to establish the stemma codicum of a work from

 its geometric diagrams alone. Several mathematical examples are considered in the

 body of this article but Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on the Shape of the Eclipse has been

 chosen as a test case because of the sophistication of its diagrams. A blind comparison

 between the diagram stemma and the text stemma reveals no major differences, thus

 suggesting the equivalence of the two procedures. Next, a comparison shows that there

 is a higher concentration of errors in a diagram than in the same area of text (Sect. 7,

 note 20). Therefore, diagrams make it easier to discriminate between and sort the

 manuscripts of a given work.

 Building the diagram stemma appears to offer a highly promising way to study and

 uncover the phylogeny of complex sets of manuscripts in geometry and geometric

 sciences such as astronomy, optics, mechanics, architecture and perspective.

 1.1 Advances in diagram studies

 From the pioneering work of Murdoch ( 1984), Edgerton ( 1985) and Mahoney ( 1985),

 increasing attention is now being paid to visual scientific data of any kind: photographs,

 diagrams, sketches and figures. The different functions of visual data have been clari

 fied, as well as the way they connect to the text. One line of investigation specifically

 concerns the use of geometric diagrams.1

 Progress has been made on gathering data from diagrams, by developing a software

 for directly capturing diagrams in manuscripts (Saito 2005). Then a team consisting of

 Gregg De Young, Takanori Suzuki, Ken'ichi Takahashi and Ken Saito was formed to

 study diagram variation in Euclid's treatises (Elements, Optica, Phaenomena) (Saito

 2011 ). The keen attention being paid to geometric diagrams is beginning to bear fruit

 in the form of critical editions of mathematical texts (Sidoli 2007; Sidoli and Berggren
 2007).

 Some general findings have already been reached. After preliminary discussions,

 scholars have studied more carefully the position, mode of composition and lettering

 of diagrams as well as the mutual dependence of text and diagrams (Decorps-Foulquier

 1999; Netz 1999). Moreover, the tacit conventions applied to drawing geometric dia
 grams are now better known:

 1. A diagram is schematized whenever possible—that is, provided it is not contrary

 to the hypotheses. For example in Apollonius' Conies, parabolas and hyperbolas
 are rendered by circular arcs (Decorps-Foulquier 1999, pp. 73-74). In Euclid's
 Elements III. 10, the ellipse EBAQM is drawn by simply joining two circular

 arcs (Netz 1999, p. 55). In most manuscripts of Euclid's Elements IV. 16, the sides

 of the fifteen-angled figure are replaced by concave arcs (Saito 2011, p. 171).

 These properties apply to many ancient and medieval manuscripts.

 2. Geometric figures are usually overspecified. The rectangular triangle appearing in

 Elements 1.47 is drawn as rectangular and isosceles (Saito 2005, p. 19). Similarly,
 in his commentary on the Book of Lemmas, al-SijzT bisects the diameter of the

 semi-circle instead of considering an arbitrary division (Crozet 2005, p. 35).

 3. Linear values as represented in the diagrams are not necessarily faithful to the
 mathematical content. Consider Euclid's Phaenomena, prop. 1. In the Berlin MS,

 radius DA is much smaller than radius DB, although it is explicitly stated that
 D is the center of circle ABÖE (Suzuki 2011, p. 17). Similar deviations are to be

 found in al-Sijzï's works (Crozet 2005, p. 35).

 1.2 Advances in stemmatology

 Another major breakthrough took place when interest in transferring the methods

 of phylogenetics to philology was spurred by the development of computer-based

 analysis.

 Conventionally, three different approaches have been used for the purpose of text

 editing. Lachmann's method is based on identifying "shared errors." This is a rigor

 ous method, which nevertheless raises the question of how to reliably identify errors

 (Lachmann 1850). Bédier and Dom Quentin both criticized Lachmann's method and

 expanded "errors" into "variant locii" to take into account the smallest details of the

 text (Bédier 1929; Dom Quentin 1922).2 The three methods by Lachmann, Bédier

 and Dom Quentin are not equally reliable, however. A critical test, comparing their

 outcomes against a benchmark text, showed the indisputable superiority of Lach

 mann's method, which was designed to identify errors (Huygens 2001). Errors can be

 regarded as a subset of text variants and include reading errors, storing errors, tran

 scribing errors, clerical errors, and errors in returning to the text, that is, omission,

 homoioarkton, homoioteleuton, additions and dittographies (Bourgain and Vielliard
 2002, pp. 34-37).

 Recently, philologists have come to the realization that their approach bears many

 similarities to the methods of evolutionary biology, where characteristics are compared

 in a pairwise manner to determine the common ancestor of a group of species. It has

 been pointed out that:

 "The stemmaticist who is analyzing the agreements and disagreements between

 manuscripts for evidence of relationship by descent, is doing the same thing as

 the evolutionary biologist who is analyzing the agreements and disagreements

 between species for evidence of relationship by descent [...] Indeed, several

 experiments in this area have proved that, for some manuscript traditions at

 least, the methods developed in evolutionary biology give remarkably accurate

 results" (Robinson 1998, p. 130).

 Phylogenetics is divided into two main approaches.3 Phenetics, which treats homo

 plasies and homologies on an equal footing, highlights current similarities between

 the taxa with no attention paid to the real phylogeny. Cladistics, which was developed

 2 For example, the simple rephrasing of statements or the transposition of the words odientis oscula to

 make the verse Quam fraudulenta oscula odientis rhyme with Meliora sunt vulnera diligentis (Huygens
 2001. p. 55).

 3 This comparison builds on the difference between homology, i.e., a similarity inherited from a common

 ancestor, and homoplasy, i.e., a similarity shared by two individuals, whereas it is not found in the ancestor.

 group of species.

 from the work of Hennig ( 1950), is targeted at discovering the common ancestor of a

 This focus brings computer-aided cladistics very close to traditional stemmatology.

 The connection can be summed up in one sentence: the researcher can build a stemma

 codicum/cladogram in order to reconstruct the common ancestor and the textual his

 tory/phylogeny from a group of manuscripts/species. This equation favors the transfer

 of methods from cladistics to stemmatology. As a result, cladistic analysis is now

 being used in the critical editing of both literary and scientific texts.4

 1.3 Intersection of the methods

 Despite the parallel development of these two research areas, the intersection of dia

 gram studies with stemmatology is still largely unexplored.

 The fragments of knowledge that we possess regarding this intersection are limited

 to the following:

 1. The actual size of the diagram does not constitute significant information. In gen

 eral, it is adapted to the space left for the drawing, and even sometimes at the risk

 of altering the diagram, when the space, particularly in the margin, is small (Saito

 2006, p. 10). The geometric diagram is then either cropped—an example is the

 diagram of Elements III.3 in Codex p (Saito 2011, p. 53) or distorted—an example

 is prop. 111.20 in Codex p (Saito 2011, p. 66).

 2. If a diagram is placed in the margin and covers a case not treated in the text,

 this strongly suggests a scribe's addition, e.g., Apollonius' Conies 1.43 and 111,1
 (Decorps-Foulquier 1999, p. 79). The same applies to Euclid's Elements III.25
 where, in all likelihood, the marginal diagrams were supplied by the copyist (Saito

 2005, p. 95).

 3. More crucially, diagram errors can allow us to retrace a handwritten tradition,

 i.e., mistakes transmitted from copyist to copyist. The diagrams of Elements 1.27,

 1.38, VI. 19 point to different families of manuscripts. For example, the diagram
 appended to prop. 1.38 differs in codex P (E T, Fig. 1) and codex B (E = f,
 Fig. 2) (Young 2004, p. 358; Young 2005, p. 158; Saito 2005, p. 134). Consider a

 manuscript such as Mantova, ebreo MS 1, fol. 8, which includes a diagram of 1.38

 where points rE are separate. If this copy were to show several such features, it

 would suggest a connection to the family of codex B rather than to the family of

 codex P. Similar conclusions can be drawn from al-SijzT's Demonstrations of the

 Book of Euclid on the Elements (Crozet 2005, p. 39).5

 4 On the application of cladistic analysis in different domains, the reader is directed to the following key
 studies: on the approach in general (Glenisson 1979; van Reenen et al. 1996, 2004; Robinson 1996; Dees

 1988; Huygens 2001 ; Woerther and Khonsari 2001 ; Macé et al. 2001 ; Macé and Baret 2006; Cipolla et al.
 2012); in literary texts (Robinson and O'Hara 1996; Salemans 1996, 2000; Barbrook et al. 1998; Mooney
 et al. 2001; Windram et al. 2008; Maas 2010); and in scientific texts (Brey 2009; Pietquin 2010; Cardelle

 de Hartmann et al. 2013).

 re

 Such observations recently gave rise to the idea that "The diagrams should be

 presented as they are found in the MSS, accompanied by a critical apparatus [...]

 Where this is possible, we should seek to establish the text history of the diagrams

 and present this in a stemma" (Sidoli 2007, p. 546). As far as I know, establishing the

 critical apparatus with a view to building a diagram stemma has not yet been done. This

 is ironic, because if one takes seriously the suggestion that the study of the history of

 mathematics has been misguided because less attention has been paid to the diagrams

 than to the text, then the key issue becomes the reconstruction of the diagram's own

 phylogeny.

 The aim of this paper is to explore the phylogeny of manuscript diagrams by con

 structing their diagram stemma. I will first clarify the data to be used, by comparing

 several types of diagrams (Sect. 2). Then I will introduce Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on

 the Shape of the Eclipse as a test case (Sect. 3). Since the text has not yet been pub

 lished in a critical edition, this provides us with a unique opportunity to conduct a test
 under ideal conditions: the unknown text stemma cannot influence the construction of

 the diagram stemma. Results will be reached by a blind, parallel construction of the

 diagram stemma (Sect. 4) and text stemma (Sect. 5). From their comparison, general
 conclusions will be drawn in the final section of this article (Sect. 6).

 2 Overview

 As is now well known to philologists, Lachmann's method must be preferred to other

 methods of critical editing (Huygens 2001). Could this approach serve as a model

 for searching through the diagrams and arranging them in a stemma? Before applying

 fourth demonstration, both refer to point H, which does not appear in MS L. In prop. 11.9 both manuscripts

 contain superfluous lines. Furthermore, MS L predates MS R for the latter is the only text where point 6 is

 placed on AH, in keeping with the text stemma.

 stemmatology to diagrams, we must first define what "characters" are. Then the robust
 ness of the method will be tested by applying these definitions to a wide range of
 situations.

 2.1 Definitions

 The establishment of the diagram stemma and the study of diagrams are two separate

 tasks. In terms of the use of diagrams, it is well known that a distorted diagram can serve

 as a basis for sound reasoning, which leads us to distinguish the simple carelessness of

 the copyist from major errors. From a stemmatological point of view, there is no reason

 to make such a distinction; we call an error any alteration that diminishes the chances of

 replicating the diagram. What are these errors? Geometric diagrams are not just simple
 images. Being built up step by step, they record a series of operations or properties,

 each one of which can potentially introduce an error. It follows that any witness (i.e.,

 a surviving manuscript that testifies to the content of the original work) can lead to a

 true or false reading vis-à-vis each operation or property. Therefore, diagram errors
 can be counted in the same way as—or perhaps even more easily than—text errors.
 In this respect, geometrical works have some advantages over literary texts.

 Definition 1 Let us call "stated characters" all the geometric properties of a diagram

 that are based on explicit statements in the text, otherwise they will be called "unstated
 characters."

 Either subjects ("square ABCD") or predicates ("ABCD is a square") can serve
 to isolate a stated character in a geometrical treatise. Consider the following problem:
 "To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of
 the remaining one" (Elements IV. 10; Fig. 3) (Heath 1956, p. 96). The text states that

 EBA is a circle. Thus, a scribe faced with the oval EBA in Codex B can restore it

 to a circle. Likewise, though missing in Codex F, line BA must be drawn. Since it is
 stated that AT — BA, the scribe can restore line BA, even if his source is Codex F.

 These are (true) stated characters. However, it is not stated whether triangle ABA is

 oriented downwards or upwards. Thus, a scribe copying Codex V cannot know that

 triangle ABA is turned downwards in all the other manuscripts. This is an unstated
 character.

 Definition 2 Let us call "true characters" those characters that conform to the math

 ematical content of the text, otherwise they will be called "false characters."

 In Euclid's Elements IV. 10 (Fig. 3), A B is the semi-diameter of circle EBA, which

 is not the case in Codex F. Similarly, no manuscript illustrates the point AT = BA,

 which, however, is clearly stated in the text. These are false (stated) characters. Fur

 thermore, a correct construction would require that circles ATA and EBA meet at

 two points.6 This is a false (unstated) character in all manuscripts, except in Codex F
 where it is true.

 Definition 3 Let us call "separative characters" those characters found in only one

 manuscript, "conjunctive characters" those in which several copies agree, and "com

 mon" or "shared characters" those which are common to all manuscripts.

 Let us consider again Euclid's Elements IV. 10 (Fig. 3). It is stated that ATA is

 a circle. This is a (true) conjunctive character appearing in Codices p, F, b and V—

 not in Codices P and B, which have a separative (false) character here. Furthermore,

 ATA appears to be right-angled at F in all the codices, despite the fact that this is
 inconsistent with proposition IV. 10, which instead requires that r = n — = 108°.
 This is a shared (false) character.

 Types of errors True and false characters refer to the concept of "being mathemat

 ically true" (i.e., true to the mathematical content of the text), whereas shared and

 separative characters refer to the concept of "being codicologically true" (i.e., true

 to the content of the manuscripts). Mathematical and codicological properties do not

 coincide in all cases because a mathematical error is detected by comprehension, while

 a codicological error is detected by comparing the manuscripts. All scholars involved

 in critical editing have come across these two types of truth. When the manuscripts

 are corrupted by the same errors, the codicological study is unable to detect them all

 and the definitions provided above could help to identify such overlappings. The cross

 analysis of mathematical truth/error and codicological truth/error yields four possible

 cases:

 needed.

 1. When the mathematical truth and the codicological truth coincide, no comment is

 2. Codicologically true characters, i.e., shared characters, may all repeat the same

 mathematical error: e.g., r is right-angled in all codices instead of being equal to

 108° as we can deduce from the text (Fig. 3).

 6 Heath assumes that A and E are the two points of intersection of ATA and EBA, though it is not explicit

 in Euclid: "With centre A and distance AB let the circle BAE be described..." (Heath 1956, p. 96).

 3. The mathematical truth cannot be reconstructed codicologically false characters

 in a diagram—this does not, however, prevent us from inferring the truth from

 false diagrams.

 4. When mathematical and codicological error coincide, no comment is necessary.

 Therefore, only one case must be specified: when diagram characters that are cod

 icologically true reflect a mathematical error, they are "shared false characters." In

 conclusion, the ambiguous concept of codicological truth gives rise to two cases:

 "true characters" when they correspond to mathematical truth, "shared false charac

 ters" when they differ from it.7

 NotationsFox clarity's sake, in the remainder of the text all characters have been

 labeled using the format "Diagram-Number index •" The index is assigned a value among

 s, u, t or f, where s denotes a "character stated in the text," u a "character unstated in

 the text," t a "mathematically true character," and / a "mathematically false character."

 As the true characters are of little use in establishing the stemma (they consist of a

 simple series of 0, such as circle ATA in Table 1), we can dispense with discussing

 indices t and /. A character common to all manuscripts is marked *. Thus, a code such

 as 1-06,, * denotes the 6th unstated character appearing in Diagram 1, which is common

 to all manuscripts. A variance between manuscripts is taken into account by coding 0

 for "the diagram's being mathematically true" and x otherwise.8 In order to highlight

 only the most relevant graphical errors, those representing less than five percent of

 the linear (Ax/x < 0.05) or angular ( Aot/a < 0.05) measurements are ignored. This

 notation is applied to a few characters of Elements IV. 10 for illustration (Table 1).

 2.2 Preliminary tests

 Preliminary tests of the above definitions were conducted on a wide range of situations

 in order to establish their reliability. These tests focused on diagrams from Euclid's
 Elements, Books I-IV, VI, XI-XIII (Saito 2005, 2011, 2013), Euclid's Phaenomena

 7 Shared true characters also include the so-called "co-exact" geometric properties. "Co-exact attributes are

 those conditions which are unaffected by some range of every continuous variation of a specified diagram"

 (Manders 2008, p. 92). Typically, these are topological relations, which are more stable than magnitudes or

 ratios of magnitudes.

 8 With a view toward creating a matrix of characters, I have used straightforward codes: f: false, s: smaller,

 g: greater, e: equal, p: positive, n: negative, u: up, d: down, r: right. I: left, and ? for a missing character.

 (Suzuki 2011), Theodosius' and Menelaus' Spherics (Sidoli and Saito 2009; Sidoli

 and Li 2011), and included a few comparisons of the stemmata built from stated and
 unstated errors.

 Based on these preliminary tests it is possible to state the following:

 1. The manuscript with the least errors should be taken as a basis for diagram editing.

 This holds true even if this copy differs from the autograph (indeed, the original

 autograph could have been a rough draft, with the entire set of copies being cor
 rected much later).

 2. A key property of unstated false characters is that, if a scribe reproduces a corrupted

 model, he cannot correct the error by referring to the text. Therefore, unstated char

 acters are of particular interest when reconstructing the history of a mathematical
 text.

 3. The chance of finding unstated false characters depends directly on the complexity

 of the diagram, which can be roughly estimated by the number of lines needed to

 draw the diagram. For anyone wishing to study the phylogeny of a set of diagrams,

 it is advantageous to focus on the more complicated ones.

 4. The chance of finding unstated false characters also depends on the kind of problem

 examined: arithmetics, plane geometry or solid geometry.

 Compared to other situations, diagrams illustrating ratios and proportions provide

 only a limited number of usable characters. Consider the proposition: "Equiangular

 parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides"

 (Elements VI.23; Fig. 4). The number of distinctive characters can be counted on

 one hand. Lines K, A, M are equal in Codex P (false) vs unequal in Codex V (true).

 The parallelogram Ê A® H is a square in Codex P vs a rectangle in Codex V. Now
 if r A 0 £ is a square, then Codex P is false, because if A r — rH, the relation
 BTTH-.-.A r-TE implies BT = rE. Lines K, A, M are on the left side in Codex

 P vs on the right side in Codex V. Consequently, a large number of diagrams would
 be needed to build the stemma.

 Diagrams of plane geometry illustrate the standard situation, with an acceptable

 number of usable false unstated characters.

 Except in the event of very basic diagrams,9 problems of solid geometry are par

 ticularly conducive to false unstated characters because a plane representation of a

 three-dimensional object is always subject to conventions (rabattement, orthogonal

 generally tacit, they increase the number of unstated characters, and thus, the chance

 that the scribe will misinterpret the diagram.

 3 A test case

 Ihn al-Haytham's Maqälafi siirat al-kusüf (Epistle on the Shape of the Eclipse) has

 been chosen as a test case for several reasons. Firstly, there is no critical edition
 available, and therefore, the unknown text stemma cannot influence the construction

 of the diagram stemma. Secondly, Diagrams 1 and 3 are complicated diagrams. Thus,

 the chance of finding false unstated characters is high. Thirdly, Diagrams 1, 3 and 4

 are three-dimensional representations which are conducive to false unstated characters

 and therefore of special interest in reconstructing a diagram's own phylogeny.

 Versions of the Epistle are extant in five manuscripts:

 F Istanbul, Fätih, MS 3439, fols. 117r-123v. Size 190 x 130 mm. Incomplete. Ends

 at time 0.922.10 This copy, written in poor naskhT, was completed in Mosul by
 Ibrahim ar-Rüjänl al-Bakrï on the night of 'Ashürä' A.H. 587/7 February 1191

 (Krause 1936, p. 458). It is extremely corrupted up to time 0.061. The diagrams

 are legible enough but often distorted. Diagram 4 is missing.

 B Oxford, Bodleian, MS Arch. Seid. A32, fols. 81v-100v. Size 180 x 115 mm. B is

 written in a hurried naskhT. "[It] was transcribed before A.H. 633 (1235-6), being

 contained in a volume which came into the possession of Yahyâ ibn Muhammad ibn

 al-Labödl in that year. In the colophon we are informed that the copyist transcribed

 the text from a copy claiming to have been transcribed from the prototype" (Sabra

 and Shehaby 1971, p. ix). The diagrams often impinge on the text. They are distorted

 by a lack of parallelism and squareness. The intersection points are rough.

 P St. Petersburg, Institute of Oriental Manuscripts, MS B 1030, fols. 21r-47v. Incom
 plete. Ends at time 0.925. Size 170 x 92 mm (Khalidov 1986, No. 9749). MS P
 predates the mid-fourteenth century, for it was checked against Ibn al-Haytham's

 autograph in A.H. 750/1349. "This collection, written in mediocre nasta'lîq, is of

 great scientific quality" (Rashed 2005, p. 15). All of its diagrams are geometrically
 clear and accurate.

 O London, India Office, MS 1270 (Loth 734), fols. 79r-86v, ends at time 0.998 seven

 words before the end. Size 279 x 114 mm." The manuscript is in good naskhT,

 evidently from the sixteenth century. The copy is well written in a small hand, with

 neat diagrams (Loth 1877, p. 214). MS O was initially part of the library of Richard

 Johnson, who came back to England in 1799. MS O was purchased by the India
 Office at the nabob's death in 1807.

 i0 In order to locate a passage parallel to a given passage in any extant manuscript, we define a new
 measurement called "time," which counts 0 as the beginning of the text and I as the end of the text in

 any complete version. Thereby one can precisely define a given passage from any text. As regards the

 transliteration of the Arabic, I have adopted DIN-31635 throughout, except for G 'ayn, which does not

 interfere with ö |îm or G gayn.

 Building the stemma codicum from geometric diagrams 217

 L London, India Office, MS 461 (Loth 767), fols. 8v-34r. Size 229 x 140mm. The

 manuscript is written in good nasta 'lîq. Its date can be deduced for it includes a copy

 of al-Tûsï's Risäla al-asturläbiyya (Treatise on the Astrolabe), which was revised
 on 14 Shawwäl A.H. 1198/31 August 1784. It could have belonged to Governor

 General Warren Hastings (1773-1785), before it passed into the collection of the

 London Library (Loth 1877, p. 223). MS L has finely drawn diagrams, which appear

 on a separate sheet.

 Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle has been uncritically edited by Wiedemann (1914) and
 independently commented on by Nazïf (1942/1943). Neither of these meets the

 requirements of a critical edition, which is currently under preparation.

 Ibn al-Haytham's treatise has four diagrams ("Appendix B", Fig. 15). Diagram 1

 shows the partially eclipsed sun ABÖD projected through the pinhole HTH of a camera

 obscura on the wall opposite to the pinhole. The projected crescent-shaped images of

 the sun are ÉYHF through point H, KLMN through point T, and TZGQ through point H.

 Diagram 2 is a lemma stated in view of the next proposition. Diagram 3 reproduces

 Diagram 1 with some additional features showing how the crescent-shaped figures

 overlap one another. Diagram 4 is a detailed view of the two lunes SYHF and KLMN

 appearing in Diagram 3.

 Starting from the definitions given in Sect. 2.1, several tables of characters can
 be built. Let us set aside the list of all "true characters" (a series of 0) and "shared

 characters" (a series of the same letter, denoting the same accident), which can con
 tribute little to the establishment of the stemma. We are able to construct two tables

 of characters:

 Table 5 ("Appendix A") presents forty-eight "stated characters" to be found in at

 least one manuscript of the Epistle. As said before, these stated characters are explicitly
 referred to in the text.

 Table 6 ("Appendix A") similarly provides a table of "unstated characters," which

 are not referred to in the text. The search for those properties of the diagrams that are

 unstated in the text yields forty-eight characters.

 4 Building the diagram stemma

 4.1 Diagram errors

 The most notable alterations affecting the diagrams of Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on

 the Shape of the Eclipse are the following:

 1. Diagram 4 is missing in MS F, because the text breaks off at time 0.922, switching to

 a copy of Ibn al-Haytham's Maqâlafîkayfiyyat al-azläl (Epistle on the Formation

 of Shadows).

 2. In most manuscripts, Diagrams 1 and 3 show the outer rays of the visible part of
 the sun as lines DHF and DTN. We find a constant error in MS F, which has lines

 BHF and BTN instead. These errors appear in Table 6 as 3-04u,3-05„.

 3. Diagram 3 of MS B offers a textbook case of the interplay between text and

 diagram. This diagram is very corrupted: STF and DHF appear as broken lines,
 while DT cuts the vertical axis 7Z between N and L. However, these accidents

 cannot be counted as proper errors, because a marginal addition appended to MS
 B expressly states that "line STF must be straight, as well as the line DHF" and

 "line DTN is tangent to arc KNM at point N" (MS B, fol. 96r, time 0.757). Thus,

 a scribe copying MS B can restore a correct diagram. These features are missing

 in Table 6 because they were not included in the construction of the stemma.

 4. Even though MS L is the latest extant copy (1784), it contains several true char

 acters which are missing in all the other manuscripts ( 1 -03,, 3-08,, 3-10,, 3-15,,
 3-16.v,3-17.V) or are almost never seen (2-05.,, 4-02.,, 4-06.,, 1-14«, 3-05«, 3-12«,

 3-15«). The overcorrectness of MS L suggests that the scribe redrew the lines

 of the diagrams by following the textual instructions found or by having at his

 disposal another set of diagrams.

 When all the diagrams agree across manuscripts, they either agree or do not agree

 with the text. In the second case there are common or shared errors, i.e., conjunctive

 errors found in all the manuscripts (Maas 1958). In general, such errors belong to the

 ancestor: if all MSS agree on an erroneous line, there is a low likelihood that they rep

 resent independent departures from the ancestor. Bearing in mind L's overcorrectness,

 let us focus on the errors common to all the other manuscripts (F, B, P and O). As the

 errors reported in Table 2 are common to all manuscripts, they should be seen as a

 list of errors/choices made by the hand that copied out the common ancestor which,

 due to the limited number of manuscripts, was perhaps written by Ibn al-Haytham

 himself. Since past scholars have not mentioned these characters (Wiedemann 1914,

 p. 158; NazTf 1942/3, pp. 190-196; Sabra 1972, p. 196), they must be addressed in
 detail.

 Errors 3-08,, 3-10,, 3-16., and 3-17., (absence or deformation of the flanking circles

 §T, HG) seem to result from the lack of space on the manuscript. Since Diagram 3

 touches the edge of the folio in MSS F, P and O, it would have extended beyond the

 edge of the folio if it be had been drawn in accordance with what was written in the
 text. However, these errors have little effect on the demonstration.

 Errors 1 -07v and 3- 14v (lack of collinearity of AÔKM) seem to go back a very long

 way. Even though these points are stated to be collinear in the text, the scribe—Ibn al

 Haytham?—did not feel impelled to explicitly draw the line AM. As a consequence,

 all copyists erred in locating AÖ and KM in a haphazard fashion.

 Errors 1-11*, l-12f, 1-02«, 1-03« and 1-04« (the inequality of the inner/outer arcs
 of the crescent-shaped figures) are more interesting because they have a rationale.

 According to the text, FN is the radius of both arcs KNM and KLM. It necessarily

 follows that arc KLM is horseshoe-shaped. But the scribe—Ibn al-Haytham?—had in

 mind to draw the two flanking lines $KT and HMG on which the lunes are chained.

 Therefore, if the arcs are drawn based on what is stated in the text, the two flanking

 lines cut the arc KLM ($YH or TZG) in the vicinity of points K M (S H or T G).
 As a result, the diagram is unclear because the lines overlap each other. Visually, the

 result can be appreciated in the mathematically true diagram ("Appendix B", Fig. 15).

 The agreement between all the extant copies means that the scribe of the common

 ancestor—Ibn al-Haytham?—took the decision to clean up the diagram so that K

 and M (S and H, T and G) constitute both the end-points of the lune and its points of

 tangency with lines S KT and HMG. The simplest way to achieve this without changing

 the magnitude of the eclipse was to increase the radius of arcs KNM, $FH and TQG,

 a decision fully implemented in MS P, Diagram 3 ("Appendix B", Fig. 12).

 4.2 MS P contains the fewest errors

 If one accepts as valid the idea that a stemma codicum can be constructed from

 diagrams, the manuscript with the fewest diagrammatic errors is to be regarded as the

 most faithful witness to the autograph. Let us therefore count all the errors, omitting

 those of Diagram 4 which are missing in MS F (Table 3). Errors are classified depending

 on whether they are stated (S) or unstated (U).

 Whatever the criterion chosen (S or U Errors), the best witness is definitely MS

 Petersburg with only 16 S Errors out of 65 susceptible loci and 6 U Errors out of 40

 susceptible loci found in Diagrams 1-3. Then follows MS India 461 with 20 S Errors

 and 19 U Errors. Extended to all manuscripts and all types of errors, this comparison

 provides the ordinal ranking of the five manuscripts of Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle. If

 "A -< B " denotes "A is preferred to B," this ranking may be written:

 Petersburg -< India 461 -< India 1270 -< Bodleian -< Fätih

 Table 3 shows that the distributions of S, U and SU Errors provide the same ordinal

 ranking. Nevertheless, it is helpful to assess their effectiveness in sorting the manu

 scripts. At face value, S Errors are more severe than U Errors because they mean that

 the scribe passed over the instructions given in the text. However,

 1. The average number of errors at the susceptible loci is 0.51 (U) > 0.40 (S Errors).12

 The risk of error is thus higher in the case of unstated characters.

 2. The maximum difference in the number of errors by susceptible loci is 0.65 (U) >

 0.31 (S Errors).13 The manuscripts are therefore better discriminated by unstated

 characters than by stated ones.

 These two differences are easy to understand. When a diagram is drawn, some lines

 meet the requirements stated in the demonstration and others do not. If a geometric

 property is explicitly stated in the text, it can be checked and the chance of error is

 smaller. If the line is drawn at random, then the scribe has no means of recovering the

 figure through the text and there is a higher chance of error. Consequently, in the event

 of a difference between S and U rankings, the best classification is given by U Errors

 alone, in consideration of statement 2, just above.

 How should we classify the manuscripts? The greater the number of characters,

 the greater the accuracy of the stemmatological analysis. Assuming that stability is
 an indication of an exact result, let us try to establish the threshold at which the

 correct ranking of codices is provided by single diagrams. By ordering the manuscripts

 according to the number of U Errors, MS P is ranked first regardless of the diagram

 used. This is an indication that a set of 20 susceptible loci is needed to identify the

 best witness to a handwritten tradition. The final ranking of the manuscripts happens

 to be the same as the one produced by considering the errors of Diagram 3—while

 the ranking for Diagram 1 is different. As a merging of errors from Diagrams 1-3 is

 needed to arrive at the correct ranking, it is safe to assume that a set of 40 susceptible

 loci (at least) is required to provide a stable ranking of the manuscripts, whatever the
 text to be edited.

 This outcome is of great interest from a methodological point of view because it

 means that, once the text has been read to understand its meaning and scope, there

 is no need to codicologically analyze the text errors in detail. We just need to pick

 errors at random in the diagrams,14 provided the number of susceptible loci is great

 enough: say over fifty to rank all the manuscripts. This preliminary conclusion should

 be addressed more fully in further research.

 12 This is the result of (36 + 30 + 16 + 29 + 20)/5/65 = 0.40 and (32 + 24 + 6 + 20 + 19)/5/40 = 0.51.

 13 This is the result of (36 - 16)/65 = 0.31 and (32 - 6)/40 = 0.65.

 14 A random selection of errors in diagrams will yield a certain combination of stated and unstated errors.

 At one extreme, it is possible that the random draw will include stated errors only, in which case the result

 will be the same as if we based our analysis on the errors the text. Otherwise, the random draw will include

 Fig. 5 Matrix of the diagram characters

 4.3 The diagram stemma

 Next, the diagram stemma should be built from the list of characters ("Appendix
 A") using standard cladistics programs such as PAUP* (Swofford 2003) or PHYLIP
 (Felsenstein 2009). I chose PHYLIP, which has been adopted and tested by several
 philologists, one recent trial being that of Pietquin (2010) in his critical edition of Ibn
 al-Haytham's Optics, Book VII.

 The matrix of characters is made of six taxa (the five extant manuscripts of Ibn
 al-Haytham's Epistle and the out-group, which simply consists of the list of common

 features) and of as many characters as we decide to examine. Figure 5 shows the matrix

 corresponding to the SU Errors found in Diagrams 1-4, but the matrix consisting of

 all unstated characters is sufficient. I have checked and verified that they provide a
 similar result.

 Next, a cladistic method must be chosen, which brings us to the important issue
 of what this choice should be based on. Thirteen major cladistics techniques have
 recently been compared by estimating the similarity between the stemmata they pro
 vided on three independent data sets (Roos and Heikkilä 2009).15 This comparison
 showed the superiority of two methods (maximum parsimony and RHM). In view of

 its effectiveness and wide diffusion, I have adopted the maximum parsimony method.

 Given a set of manuscripts, several stemmata can account for the same distribution

 of characters. Since the number of stemmata increases rapidly with the number of
 manuscripts, the parsimony rule—i.e., the assumption that nature chooses the sim
 plest course—selects the simplest stemma among all possible stemmata that may be
 constructed. The simplest stemma is the one that requires the fewest steps to explain

 the observed distribution of characters. The parsimony rule does not necessarily reveal

 the true phylogeny, but it provides the arrangement best supported by the data. A main
 criticism levelled against the parsimony rule is that this method is reliable only if
 homoplasies are rare. When the ancestor is known, the number of homoplasies can
 be counted, otherwise it must be put up for discussion. In the present case, one can
 be confident that homoplasies are rare, because a manuscript exists that is very close

 some unstated errors as well, and in this case the result will be better than if we had simply selected errors
 in the text, because unstated errors are more discriminating than stated errors (Property 2 in Sect. 4.2).
 Therefore, the resolution capability of a random selection of the errors contained in diagrams is greater than
 or equal to the resolution capability of an analysis based on stated errors.

 15 The techniques are RHM, PAUP Parsimony, Parsimony Bootstrap, Neighbour Joining, Neighbour Join
 ing Bootstrap. Least Squares, Least Squares Bootstrap; n-Gram Clustering; SplitsTree4 NeighborNet, Split
 Decomp, ParsimonySplits, CompLearn, Hierarchical Clustering, and seven manual methods. The similarity
 between the stemmata produced is estimated by the average sign distance ASD, which provides a value
 ranging from 0 (the two stemmata are different) to I (the two stemmata are identical).

 to the out-group: MS Petersburg, with a total of 6 U Errors (Table 3). Thus, PHYLIP's

 maximum parsimony algorithm can be used with confidence.

 When this program is applied to the matrix of characters described above, one most

 parsimonious tree is found (Fig. 6). The manuscripts connect to several ancestors

 by means of branches whose (horizontal) length is proportional to the number of

 transformed characters between the ancestor and the manuscript.16 Therefore, it is not

 surprising that the above stemma provides the same ranking of the manuscripts.

 In the stemma above, MS Petersburg directly connects to the common ancestor [ 1 ].

 MS India 461 stems from an intermediate node [2] between MSS Petersburg and India
 Office 1270. MSS Bodleian and Fätih share a common intermediate ancestor [4],

 This finding may be checked in multiple ways. I have redrawn the stemma cod
 icum on the basis of S, U or SU Errors separately, as well as from Diagram 1 and 3

 separately. It appears that the results based on the type of error are roughly the same,

 except as regards the length of the branches. When Diagram 1 or 3 is used alone, the

 result is less stable, because the branching of MS India 461 moves from one node to

 another. This confirms that the method is reliable only in analyses involving more than

 fifty characters.

 In any case, the present example i ndicates that a stemma codicum can be constructed

 with confidence from geometric diagrams alone.

 5 Building the text stemma

 As the text and diagrams are physically linked to each other, a powerful test can

 be affected by comparing the diagram stemma (Sect. 4) with the stemma codicum

 independently reconstructed from the text alone by standard methods.

 Either the stemma codicum constructed from diagrams will coincide with that

 constructed from the text, or it will not. If they do coincide, this could be an indication

 that the two methods are equivalent; otherwise, the differences should be addressed.

 As is well known to philologists, long omissions and additions are of special interest

 for building the text stemma (Viré 1986; Woerther and Khonsari 2001). While a scribe

 16 A branch of zero length means that there is no difference between the manuscript (terminal node) and

 the progenitor (intermediary node). The closest fit is MS Petersburg, which is very similar to the out-group.

 can compensate for the omission of one word, he cannot restore a passage of several

 words without referring to a source. Therefore, all the descendants of a corrupted
 model will carry the same corruption. We shall focus here on long omissions and
 additions, because this is the most reliable way to obtain the stemma from the text
 alone.

 I first collated all the known extant manuscripts of Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle from

 time 0.000 to 0.922 (which coincides with the end of MS Fätih). A count of all

 the textual accidents—with the exception of diacritics, orthographical variants, and
 articles—yielded the following results (Table 4).

 We can limit ourselves to the three categories alteravit, addidit, omisit, because

 other alterations are less significant. Marginal corrections and transpositions are not
 marks of imperfection, nor are repetitions. The latter are a convention used in Arabic

 manuscripts to return to the main text after restoring an omission; such repetitions are

 preceded by the oblivion mark f. The total number of errors (Total123) and the omisit

 ^ 3to (which records the number of long omissions over three words) both yield the
 same ordinal ranking:

 Petersburg -< India 1270 -< Bodleian -< Fätih -< India 461

 The collated manuscripts thus provide an ordinal ranking which is very similar to
 the one reached by the analysis of diagrams alone, except for MS India Office 461—a

 case to which we shall return shortly.

 5.2 The text stemma

 Text accidents can be encoded in various ways. I have chosen the weighted omission

 system, which replaces any textual omission 1/0 by the number of words omitted. This

 is both a rapid and reliable method. A matrix of characters is built as previously. It

 consists of six taxa (the five MSS and the out-group, that is, the text without errors)
 and of as many characters as there are omissions in the text from time 0.000 to time

 0.922. PHYLIP's maximum parsimony algorithm is then applied as in Sect. 4.3. Again,

 a single most parsimonious tree is found (Fig. 7). In this stemma, MS Petersburg is

 6 Discussion

 In this stemmatological analysis of the manuscripts of Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on

 the Shape of the Eclipse, the text stemma (Fig. 7) was found to be quite similar

 to the diagram stemma (Fig. 6), except for one manuscript—MS India Office 461.

 From the diagram stemma, in which it was ranked extremely high (just below MS

 Petersburg, the best witness), in the text stemma MS India Office 461 jumped over

 three manuscripts to arrive last in the ranking. Its text has now been determined to stem

 from the same archetype as MS Fätih, which would explain its receding from third to

 fifth place in the ranking of the manuscripts. Succinctly put, it means that MS India

 Office 461 is a reliable witness to the diagrams but unreliable with regard to the text,

 while MS Bodleian is a reliable witness to the text but unreliable as to the diagrams.
 This difference is understandable:

 1. The diagrams of MS B are very faulty. The scribe himself was aware of this

 situation. In the marginal annotation to Diagram 3, he criticizes his own work and

 describes the figure as it was in the archetype he used: "The line STF must be

 straight, as well as the line DHF... the extension of the line DT meets N, so that

 the line DTN is tangent to arc KNM at point N" (MS B, fol. 96r, time 0.757). This

 brief note is hardly sufficient. Many more accidents should have been corrected

 and these errors are largely responsible for the recession of MS B in the diagram

 ranking.

 2. The diagrams of MS L have all been drawn together on a separate sheet (fol. 34r),

 which has a different format than the text (plate 215 x 280 mm; text 229 x 140 mm).

 By contrast, the diagrams are embedded in the text in all other extant manuscripts

 of the Epistle. This strongly suggests that the diagrams were corrupted or absent

 in the ancestor of MS L. Its diagrams could have been redrawn either from textual

 instructions, or from another exemplar (Sect. 4.1).17

 '7 This conclusion does not hold for later periods. With the spread of copperplate engraving, diagrams were

 frequently grouped together on pages distinct from the text in printed editions (Rider 1993; Barrow-Green

 2006). Prof. Gregg de Young informs me that later manuscripts could at times reproduce this arrangement,

 Fig. 9 Text stemma—L

 Accordingly, MS L presents a textbook example of a distinct lineage for the text

 and diagrams because the switch of MSS B L in the stemma is confirmed by direct

 physical inspection of the manuscripts.

 Further confirmation of external contamination of the diagrams is provided by

 another reconstruction of the stemmata after having first removed MS L (India Office

 461) from both the diagram and the text matrices (Fig. 8, 9).

 The withdrawal of MS L provides two stemmata that are topologically identical,

 excepting a variation in length of the branches.18 MS Petersburg connects to the lost
 ancestor [1], MS India Office 1270 stems from node [2]. MSS Fätih and Bodleian
 connect to node [3],19

 These results are in line with other scholarly studies of Ibn al-Haytham's works.

 In the critical edition of Ibn al-Haytham's Maqäla mustaqsätfi al-ashkäl al-hiläliyya

 (Comprehensive Treatise on Crescent-Shaped Figures), MSS P and O (there denoted

 MSS L and A) were found by Rashed to independently derive from the lost ancestor:

 MS P directly connects to the ancestor, while MS O stems from it through two interme

 diate archetypes (Rashed 1993, pp. 24-25). In the critical edition of Ibn al-Haytham's

 Qawlfî birkâr al-dawâ 'ir al- 'izâm ( Discourse on the Compass of Great Circles ), MSS

 Footnote 17 continued

 such as Cairo, Där al-kutub, handasa turkiyya 42, ca. 1300 H./1834 or Tal'at Riyäda, handasa turkiyya 3,

 ca. 1250 H./1882. Quite possibly, these two manuscripts were copied from the Usül-i hendese, a Turkish

 translation by Hüseyin Rtfki Tamânïof Bonnycastle's Elements of Geometry that was printed by the Matba'at
 Büläq in 1241 H71825 (Young2012, p. 51).

 18 This variation in length means that there are more text differences than diagram differences between,
 say, node [2] and MS India 1270 (Fig. 8,9).

 19 Another way to proceed might have been to search for the consensus tree between the diagram and text

 stemmata. We did not proceed any further in this direction, because the consensus tree algorithm is based

 on bootstrapping, which has certain limitations (Wiesemiller and Rothe 2006, pp. 161-5; Kitching 1998,
 pp. 129-31).

 P and O (there denoted MSS L and B) belong to two separate branches. MS P stems

 from the ancestor, while MS O has two intermediate archetypes (Rashed 2006, pp.

 856-857). These findings are in accordance with the present independent analysis.

 Returning now to the scholarly literature on Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle, it appears

 that the diagrams are quite often faulty in the editions of Wiedemann (1914), NazTf

 (1942/1943) and Sabra (1972). Wiedemann is wrong on characters l-01.v, l-07.v, 1
 12,., 1-16,; 2-02,, 2-03,, 2-01«, 2-02,,, 2-03,,; 3-07„ 3-08,, 3-09„ 3-10,, 3-11,,
 3-12,, 3-13,, 3-14,, 3-15,, 3-16,, 3-17,; 4-04„ 4-05„ 4-26„ 4-07,„ 4-08„. NazTf

 was not aware of the diagrams of Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle, since he relied instead on

 the 1928 Hyderabad edition of Kamâl al-Dïn's Tanqîh al-Manâzir. Sabra in his turn

 copied NazTf's diagrams.

 Accordingly, a key result of the present study is that we should in any case distin

 guish between the (mathematically true) diagrams drawn in order to explain the text

 and the (codicologically true) diagrams produced for a critical edition worthy of the

 name. Historians of science ought at least to be conscious of and state clearly what

 they are doing. The critical editing of Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle should be based on

 MS P (the lectio praeferenda) and MS O, these being the most reliable witnesses, with
 the aid on occasion of MSS B and L.

 7 Conclusions

 The purpose of this paper was to explore the phylogeny of diagrams contained in

 mathematical manuscripts by constructing the first stemma of diagrams ever to be
 published. After preliminary tests and clarification, Ibn al-Haytham's Epistle on the

 Shape of the Eclipse was selected as the test case.

 The principal finding from the stemmatological analysis of this set of manuscripts

 was the strong similarity between the diagram and text stemmata, with the exception

 of one manuscript whose diagrams were drawn on a separate sheet. The results were

 reached by a blind, parallel construction of the diagram and text stemmata. From the

 analysis and discussion presented above, we can draw the following conclusions:

 CI. The codicological study of diagrams is needed in all cases, because it can help

 us find features that might otherwise be overlooked. Specifically, the critical editing of

 diagrams should retain all the shared characters and all the unstated characters from

 the manuscript that constitutes the best witness. This method is seldom applied in

 the critical editing of geometrical texts, which usually adopts the text as its reference

 and replaces the original diagrams with mathematically true diagrams. There is a

 simple reason for this bias: to choose which diagram to reproduce, a comprehensive

 stemmatological study of diagrams is required.

 C2. It is sufficient to analyze the unstated characters in a small number of diagrams,

 provided the number of susceptible loci is great enough ( i.e., over 50) to calculate the

 manuscript ranking. Once the text has been read and understood, there is no need to

 study in detail the errors in the text, for unstated characters are more discriminating

 than stated characters. Even if the ranking would improve in reliability by including

 an ever larger number of susceptible loci, there is no need to undertake an overly long

 codicological analysis. Hence, this suggested guideline.

 Building the stemma codicum from geometric diagrams 227

 C3. Contrary to the general study of mathematical diagrams, stemmatology is not

 concerned with the meaning of errors, but with the fact that they can provide us

 with information regarding a manuscript's phylogeny. The link between the text and

 diagram stemmata suggests that the phylogeny shows a low sensitivity with regard to

 the number of hands involved, i.e., whether the copy was made by one or more scribes.

 Copyists make errors of their own, but the extent of the possible errors depends on the

 existence of unstated characters in the source. Thus, the diagram and text stemmata

 can vary, but they cannot be utterly different.

 C4. The diagram stemma and text stemma are similar when the text and diagrams

 are created at the same time. When physical inspection of the manuscripts reveals

 diagrams properly embedded in the text, there is no reason to presume a shift between

 the text and diagrams and the stemma can be constructed from either the text or

 diagrams. If physical inspection reveals discrepancies such as marginal diagrams,

 emended diagrams, different drawing styles, diagrams appearing on separate sheets,
 both stemmata are needed.

 C5. Any geometric diagram has more susceptible loci of error than a text of the

 same size. In a text, the quantity of information roughly varies with its length (L),

 whereas in a geometric diagram the quantity of information depends on its area (L2).

 The chance of error is thus higher in a geometrical diagram than in a text taking up the

 same amount of space on the page. In the case under discussion here, the density of

 errors is seven to eight times greater in the diagrams than in the text.20 This strongly

 suggests that constructing the stemma codicum from diagrams could be faster than

 building the stemma from the text.

 C6. Under standard conditions21 it is advantageous to draw the stemma codicum

 of a handwritten mathematical tradition from its diagrams. Since in general the stem

 matological study provides similar results for the text and diagrams (C4) and errors

 are more highly concentrated in the diagrams than in the text (C5), it is more efficient

 to construct the stemma from the diagrams. This furthermore helps to clarify the rela

 tionship between the text and diagrams. A mathematical understanding of the text is

 needed with a view to establishing the diagram stemma, but the text stemma is not

 needed. The two stemmatological procedures are independent.

 What the latter conclusions suggest is an efficient and convenient procedure for

 building the stemma codicum from a set of manuscripts. At the present stage, this

 outcome should be regarding as tentative pending further research. But in any event,

 the guidelines proposed here could foster significant advances in the critical editing of

 diagrams not only in the area of geometry, but also in allied sciences such as astron

 omy, optics, mechanics, architecture and perspective, especially where the handwritten

 tradition is rich but divergent and hence confusing.

 20 The diagrams in MS O contain 48 errors within a total area of 38.26 cm2 and the error density is therefore

 Sp = 1.25 per cm2, while the text contains 138 errors within a written area of 847.20cm2: Sj = 0.16 per

 cm2. The diagrams in MS B contain 57 errors within a total area of 134.29cm2: Sp — 0.42 per cm2, while

 the text has 262 errors within an area of 4,034.84 cm2: Sf = 0.06 per cm2. Therefore, the number of errors
 is 7.0 ^ Sp/Sj < 7.8 times greater in a diagram than in a text of the same area.

 21 That is, when the diagrams are embedded in the text and show no obvious signs of emendation or
 alteration.
