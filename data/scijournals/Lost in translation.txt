 Abstract This paper examines an annotation in Newton's hand found by H. W. Turn

 bull in David Gregory's papers in the Library of the Royal Society (London). It will

 be shown that Gregory asked Newton to explain to him how the trajectories of a body

 accelerated by an inverse-cube force are determined in a corollary in the Principia·.

 an important topic for gravitation theory, since tidal forces are inverse cube. This

 annotation opens a window on the more hidden mathematical methods which Newton

 deployed in his magnum opus. The received view according to which the Principia are

 written in a geometric style with no help from calculus techniques must be revised.

 1 A standard view on the birth of rational mechanics

 Historians like to disprove received views as much as mathematicians like to prove

 long-standing unsolved conjectures. And in this paper, I might seem to be following

 a pattern that is often adopted by historians in order to arouse bewilderment and elicit

 praise. I will open my contribution with a view of the reception of Isaac Newton's

 Principia that enjoys wide currency. But let me state from the beginning that my

 aim is not to disprove: rather, my more modest claim is that the received view needs

 qualification as it offers too simplistic a narrative.

 Ν. Guicciardini

 The standard view is this: Newton's Principia revealed to mankind the right physics,

 but did so in an obsolete mathematical language. Indeed, it is claimed, Newton discov

 ered a true universal law that regulates the motions of bodies, but instead of using the

 right mathematical language, the calculus, he used geometry. So, the story continues, it

 is the merit of Continental mathematicians, such as Johann Bernoulli, Pierre Varignon,

 and Leonhard Euler, if the Principia got translated into the right language, the differen

 tial and integral calculus due to his mathematical enemy, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.1

 In this context, it is often claimed that it is Jacob Hermann and Johann Bernoulli who

 first applied calculus to central force motion by integrating the equations of motion

 for inverse-square central forces.2

 This narrative has several features that deserve praise. It demonstrates once more

 that in the eighteenth century the notion of "Newtonianism" was a highly latitudinar

 ian concept, since a mathematized Newtonian planetary theory could be advanced in

 Leibniz's notation and by adopting Leibnizian physical principles, such as conserva

 tion of vis viva, by actors who, most often, did not endorse the notion of action at a

 distance implied by gravitation theory.

 However, the standard view is too simplistic. It attributes to a monolithically defined
 Continental school, based in Basel, Paris, and the academies of Berlin and Saint Peters

 burg, all the advances in the algebraization of mechanics (the supposed translation of

 Newton's geometrical style of the Principia into the language of calculus), forgetting

 the contributions in this direction provided by British mathematicians such as David

 Gregory, Roger Cotes, Abraham De Moivre, James Stirling, Thomas Simpson, and
 Colin MacLaurin. Further, the standard view is based on considering what Newton

 printed in the Principia, but ignores what he wrote in his manuscripts and what he

 circulated through his correspondence.

 The standard view on the reception of the Principia is rooted in the highly emo

 tional nationalistic terrain of the Newton-Leibniz controversy. At the beginning of the

 eighteenth century, Leibniz and his supporters, such as Johann Bernoulli, claimed that
 the absence of calculus in Newton's magnum opus was proof positive that its author

 did not possess the new analysis by 1687. Indeed: if Newton had the calculus, why did

 he not use it in his mathematical theory of gravitation? This emotional terrain is still

 fertile nowadays, and sometime one has the impression that the flames that fuelled the

 Newton-Leibniz controversy have not yet been extinguished!

 1 Two classic masterpieces in which this view is defended are Blay (1992) and Truesdell (1960).

 2 "Newton solved what was called afterwards for a short time 'the direct Kepler problem' ('le probleme

 direct'): given a curve (e.g. an ellipse) and the centre of attraction (e.g. the focus), what is the law of this

 attraction if Kepler's second law holds? The 'probleme inverse' (today: the 'probleme direct') was attacked

 systematically only later, first by Jacob Hermann, then solved completely by Johann Bernoulli in 1710

 and following Bernoulli by Pierre Varignon" (Speiser 1996, 103). However, as we shall see, in writing
 his Principia Newton successfully applied his method of fluxions to the inverse problem for inverse-cube
 forces. Whether he could do the same for inverse-square forces is an open question. However, Newton's

 procedure expounded in an annotation to Gregory dated 1694, and which I analyse in this paper, when

 applied to inverse-square forces leads to a quadrature that Newton could perform. The quadrature occurs in
 the second catalogue of curves (ordo octavus) of De methodis (Newton 1967-1981, 3, 252), and a similar

 quadrature is employed in the solution of Corollary 2, Proposition 91, Book 1: for details, see Guicciardini
 (2009, 282-90).

 Let me state in boldface letters that it is not my aim to enter into such controversies,

 which rather than playing the role of a combative assumption, should constitute a

 dispassionate object of study for the historian (so one might legitimately ask how
 British nationalism shaped the Newton-Leibniz controversy, for example). My aim

 is not to vindicate Newton, but to interpret his work. My aim is not to answer in the

 positive to the often-posed question "Did Newton use his calculus in the PrincipiaT,
 since this is a bad historical question, in my opinion.

 The calculus is not an object, like a pebble (which is, indeed, translated as calculus

 in Latin), that can be discovered by one lucky researcher alone, but consists of a

 combination of concepts, notations, rules, and theorems. It would be difficult to say

 exactly which of these elements makes the calculus what it is, and certainly it would

 be simplistic to think that one can find it by inspection, after opening the cover of
 Newton's magnum opus.

 I am convinced that historians of mathematics should not ask themselves ques

 tions of priority and of attribution of merit. The reasons why credit attribution so often

 polarizes the attention of historians of mathematics are to be sought in nationalism and

 school-partisanship that permeate the ethos of academia (and are sometimes defined

 as "healthy"). Yet, as Luke Hodgkin puts it: "Awarding points to individuals or civ

 ilizations for their excellence in mathematics should not be part of the business of

 history" (Hodgkin 2005, 70). The history of mathematics should try to answer good

 historical questions, and I will try to identify a few of them at the end of this paper.

 But what makes a question a "good" historical question? This is very difficult to say,

 as difficult as it is to tell good mathematical conjectures from bad ones.

 2 David Gregory's Notce to the Principia

 An important document that sheds light on the mathematical methods employed by

 Newton in the Principia is an annotation written by Newton for David Gregory, the

 nephew of Newton's great contemporary James Gregory. In 1687, when he was the

 holder of the Chair of Mathematics in Edinburgh, he received a complimentary copy

 of the Principia. He remained quite impressed and began to carefully annotate the

 magnum opus in the early autumn of that year. The result was a 213-page manuscript

 entitled Notce in Newtoni Principia Mathematica Philosophice Naturalis? Probably

 for political reasons, in 1691 Gregory moved to Oxford, where he was appointed
 to the Savilian Chair of Astronomy. He soon became a convinced Newtonian, in

 connection with a group of compatriots of his, whom Anita Guerrini has labelled the

 "Tory Newtonians," and who included Archibald Pitcairne, John Craig, and John Keill
 (Guerrini 1986).

 The Notes provide a thorough commentary on the Principia, from beginning to

 end. They were written in three stages, as is evident from the dating, as well as from

 the paper and ink used. The original manuscript in Gregory's hand is kept in the Royal

 3 The original is MS 210 (Royal Society Library, London). There are also three other copies: in Christ
 Church (Oxford), in the University Library (Edinburgh), and in the Gregory Collection of the University of
 Aberdeen.

 Society (London) and shelved as MS 210. The first 33 pages, a commentary on the

 first nine sections of Book 1, were written in Edinburgh and are dated from September

 1687 to April 1688. The remaining pages were written in Oxford and are dated from
 23 December 1692 to 29 January 1694. There are also later additions, sometimes

 written on slips of paper affixed with paste or wax. The last addition was made in

 1708, the year of Gregory's death. At some point, Gregory wished to publish the Notce

 as a running commentary to the Principia. He may have communicated this project

 to Newton at the beginning (4-8) of May 1694, when he was admitted to Newton's
 chambers in a first of a series of visits.

 The May 1694 visit was very important for Gregory, since it occurred after a period

 of tension between him and Newton. The 5-day meeting changed Gregory's scientific

 life. During these days, Newton showed him his projects for a revision of the Principia,

 and let him study his tracts on fluxions, including an early version of Tractatus de

 quadratura curvarum (the treatise published as an appendix to the Opticks in 1704),

 where Newton developed "quadrature" techniques, that is methods aimed at calculating
 the area of a surface subtended under a curve. The two men also discussed the Ancients'

 prisca sapientia, religion, astronomy, alchemy, optics, and much more.

 We are in a lucky position, since Gregory wrote detailed memoranda of his encoun

 ters with Newton that are still extant. Some of these memoranda have the character

 of rather quick working annotations, and in some of them, Newton's handwriting is

 mixed with Gregory's: the pupil seems to have taken as many quick notes as he could

 with the help and encouragement of his master. And not a few concern the Principia.

 Indeed, in a memorandum (penned in July 1694) we read (in Turnbull's English

 translation):

 The second treatise [a draft of De quadratura] will contain his [Newton's]
 Method of Quadratures [...] To this he will subjoin tables [...] on these [tables]

 depend certain more abstruse parts in his philosophy as hitherto published, such

 as Corollary 3, Proposition 41 and Corollary 2, Proposition 91.4 (Newton 1668—
 1694, 386)

 Here, Gregory is referring to two corollaries of the Principia, and he is clearly making

 the observation that Newton's quadrature techniques expressed in "tables" (or "cat

 alogues") inserted in De quadratura are employed in these "more abstruse parts" of

 Newton's work. The first corollary deals with central force motion in an inverse-cube

 force field (an important topic for gravitation theory, since tidal forces are inverse

 cube), the second with the attraction exerted by a homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution

 on an external point situated on the axis of revolution (a result central for Newton's

 4 The original Latin text, of which we translate only a few relevant passages, reads: "Secundus Tractatus
 Methodum suam Quadraturarum continebit quae rem istam mire augebit et promovebit [...] Huic subjungit

 tabulas pro diversis formis et gradibus figurarum usque ad ordinem decimum [...] Item alias tabulas ad usque

 classem undecimum ubi spatia non quadrabilia cum coni sectionibus comparantur. Innituntur quaedam
 abstrusiora in Philosophia sua hactenus edita ut Corol: 3 prop. XLI et Corol: 2 prop. XCI." Newton (1967

 1981), 7, p. 197. It is very interesting that Gregory refers to tables in which "spaces which cannot be squared

 are compared with conic sections," since, as we shall see below, these are the quadrature techniques that

 allow the most difficult of the quadratures implied in Corollary 3.

 determination of the Earth's shape). It would be worth looking at both of them, but in

 this paper I shall concentrate on the first one.

 When we consult Gregory's Notce at the relevant place (written just before April

 1688), we find that Gregory had left a blank space: apparently he was not able to
 comment Corollary 3 to Proposition 41. We also find a pasted piece of paper that must

 have been added later (see Fig. 1). Indeed, a manuscript page in Newton's hand dated 8

 May 1694 (that is, dated to Gregory's stay in Cambridge) is extant amongst Gregory's

 papers.5 It is, so it seems highly probable, this manuscript that Gregory later copied

 and pasted in his Notce, since the two texts correspond almost word for word.6 What

 was Newton teaching his pupil in the rooms of Trinity College?

 3 Proposition 41, Book 1, and its Third Corollary

 3.1 Proposition 41

 We have to step back and very briefly consider Proposition 41, Book 1 (Proposition
 41, for short) (Newton 1999, 529-31). The statement poses a problem:

 Supposing a centripetal force of any kind and granting the quadratures of curvi

 linear figures, it is required to find the trajectories in which bodies will move and

 also the times of their motions in the trajectories so found. (Newton 1999, 529)

 This is a problem (in Newton's times known as the "inverse problem of central forces")
 that we still teach to our students in the courses on Newtonian mechanics. We ask that

 this problem be reduced to determine, given initial conditions, the motion of a point

 mass in a central force field. In this paper, we assume that the mass is equal to 1. We

 ask to reduce this problem to integrations, a choice of polar coordinates being the best

 for reasons of symmetry.

 In a way Newton does the very same thing, to be sure in his peculiar geometrical

 language. For the sake of brevity, I will not provide an analysis of Newton's demon

 stration of Proposition 41.1 will just consider the result on which its Corollary 3 is
 based.7

 Let us have a look at the diagram accompanying this proposition (see Fig. 2).

 Newton considers a "body" setting out from V with a given velocity under the action

 of a centripetal force. The force's centre is C. The trajectory, to be found, is VIKk.8

 5 This annotation was found by W. H. Tumbull who published it in the third volume of Newton's correspon
 dence (1668-1694, 348-54). It was later included by D. T. Whiteside in Newton (1967-1981, 6, 437-8).

 Bruce Brackenridge provides a thorough analysis of Newton's annotation for Gregory in Brackenridge
 (2003). Herman Erlichson discusses Corollary 3 in Erlichson (1994). Whiteside's commentary in Newton

 (1967-1981, 6, 352-6) is important. I am deeply indebted to the above works. Another similar, but just

 sketched, annotation concerning Corollary 3 is at the top of folio Add. 3960.13: 223r (Cambridge Univer

 sity Library) and is edited in Newton (1967-1981), 6,435-7. This annotation might have been written just

 before the one found in the Library of the Royal Society that I discuss in this paper.

 6 Indeed, in the July 1694 memorandum Gregory wrote: "Most of what in early May of 1694 he [Newton]

 had corrected or altered in his own copy has been corrected or altered at the respective places in my own

 copy or in my notes." English translation by Turnbull in Newton (1668-1694), 386. In the pasted sheet on

 p. 28 of the Notes , Gregory not only copied Newton's annotation, but added a few interesting remarks on

 a method of quadrature he claimed to have found independently from Newton and that was printed in the
 second volume of Wallis's Opera in 1693. See Guicciardini (1999), 183; Wallis (1693), 378.

 7 For a careful, step by step, analysis of Proposition 41,1 strongly recommend I. B. Cohen's commentary
 in Newton (1999, 334-45) and Nauenberg (2010).

 8 In the third edition (1726) of the Principia, the two curves to the right meet at point a and one of the two

 curves has an asymptote. This is not relevant for the present paper. I prefer to consider the text that was in

 front of Gregory's eyes and that was discussed with Newton in 1694.

 As coordinates of the body's position at /, Newton uses the distance CI — A and
 the area of the circle sector VCX. This is very nearly what we would do nowadays by

 using polar coordinates.

 The curve BFG represents the force's intensity in function of distance from the
 force's centre, or in Newton's words "[the ordinate] DF is proportional to the cen
 tripetal force in that place [CI = CD] tending towards the centre C" (Newton 1999,
 525). Thus, the area of the surface subtended to this curve measures what we would
 call mechanical work.

 It should be noted that Newton avails himself of two properties of central force
 motion that he proved in previous pages. In modern terms, we would understand
 these two properties as the law of conservation of angular momentum and the law
 of conservation of mechanical energy. In Newton's terms, the first property is that
 the area law holds if and only if the force is central [Propositions 1 and 2 in Newton
 (1999, 444-7)]. Thus, the motion is planar and the areal velocity is constant. This

 first property allows Newton to geometrically represent time as the area of the surface

 swept by the radius vector. For example, the area VCI is proportional to the time taken
 by the body to traverse the arc VI. Newton denotes the constant areal velocity with
 Q/2. The second property (that a modern reader would immediately recognize as
 the law of conservation of mechanical energy) is proved in Propositions 39 and 40
 (Newton 1999, 524-9).

 Starting from these two properties, Newton obtains two curves abz and dcx
 [defined below in (1) and (2)] that must be "squared" in order to determine
 the dependence of time (measured by the area VCI) from distance and the
 dependence of polar angle (measured by the area of the circular sector VCX)
 from distance, respectively. "Squaring" a curvilinear surface meant calculating its

 area.

 3.2 A presentist translation of Proposition 41

 With some hesitation about the risk always inherent in such translations, when the

 purpose is historically sensitive interpretation, I dare to offer the reader a translation
 into modern notation.

 Let A = r be the distance from the force centre. Let Q — h be what we call the

 magnitude of specific angular momentum. Let ABFD be + 2 fr° F (p)d ρ, where
 wo is the initial speed at CV = CX = ro·9

 Newton's two quadratures are "equivalent" (in a historically problematic way) to

 the familiar integrals for the trajectory:

 V (υ0 + 2 f Fdp - h2/r2)' (3)

 and

 dr

 ±hdr

 r2V(v0 + 2/Fdp -h2/r2)

 In order to see the equivalence more clearly, I note that Newton chooses the area

 VCI as a measure of time and the area VCX as a measure of the polar angle.

 Thus: VCI = (h/2)t = (β/2) /di and VCX = (r$/2)9 = (CX2/2) Jd0.
 For the historian, there are many important differences between Newton's concepts

 and ours. Yet, we recognize his formulation for the mathematical treatment of central

 force motion as very similar to ours—in a way, the two are "equivalent". We will

 discuss these issues of translation in the concluding section.

 9 Newton imagines that a second body falls from a rest position A so that during the vertical fall AV it

 acquires the initial given speed with which the first body is projected at V. Allowing ourselves the use of

 modern symbolism, Newton states that vj = 2 ABFD = 2 J^p=r Fdp = 2 jfV~r° Fdp + 2 J^A Fdp =

 3.3 Corollary 3: a brief outline

 But let us see what happens in Corollary 3 to Proposition 41 (Corollary 3 for short).
 Newton applies what he has obtained in Proposition 41 to the case in which the force
 varies with the inverse of the cube of the distance.

 One should note that in this case Newton forces a restriction on initial conditions so

 that the initial velocity at V is orthogonal to CV (thus, e.g. the logarithmic spiral, which
 is a possible trajectory for inverse-cube central force motion, will not be included in
 the solution of Corollary 3).

 The problem, because of Proposition 41, is reduced to the quadrature of curves abz
 and dcx, but—and this is most likely what must have been perplexing for Gregory—

 Newton provides a geometrical construction of the trajectory without giving any detail
 about how he performed the quadrature. He unhelpfully writes:

 all this follows from the foregoing proposition by means of the quadrature of a

 certain curve, the finding of which, as being easy enough, I omit for the sake of
 brevity. (Newton 1999, 532)

 Newton's construction is as follows (see Fig. 3). One begins by drawing two conics
 VRS, an ellipse (left) and a hyperbola (right), with centre C and vertex V. A point R
 slides along the conic starting from V, and we draw the tangent at R meeting the axis
 CV at Τ. We draw the line CR. The trajectory traced by the body is constructed by
 drawing a segment CP, whose length is equal to CT, and making an angle VCP with
 the axis CV proportional to the area of the conic sector VCR. The point Ρ traces the
 sought trajectory (Newton 1999, 531-2).10

 We should appreciate the visual beauty of this construction. One should note that
 as the point R slides along the conics starting from V, the areas of the conic sectors
 VCR monotonically increase. In the case of the hyperbola, the tangent at R tends to

 an asymptote passing through the centre C, while in the case of the ellipse the tangent

 tends to a line parallel to the axis CV as the angle VCR approaches 7r/2. This allows us

 10 In the modified diagram printed in the third edition (1726) of the Principia, the trajectory associated
 with the auxiliary hyperbola is more clearly drawn as spiralling towards C.

 to visualize how in the case of the trajectory constructed via the auxiliary hyperbola
 (right), the point Ρ spirals towards the centre C, since CT — CP tends to zero as

 the polar angle VCP tends to infinity. On the other hand, in the case of the trajectory

 constructed via the ellipse (left), CT = CP tends to infinite, as the polar angle VCP

 tends to a finite value, and thus, the body ascends in a spiral-like trajectory escaping

 to infinity along an asymptote.

 4 Motion in an inverse-cube force field: a modern interlude

 A short interlude on the modern treatment of inverse-cube trajectories is now in order.

 This is done, because after all we look at the past from a present viewpoint, and we

 might need to be a little bit refreshed on this topic (often an exercise for physics
 undergraduates).11

 It is required the determination of the motion (given initial position and velocity)

 of a point mass (m = 1) accelerated by a centripetal and isotropic force

 Since the mechanical energy Ε and the angular momentum h = r χ ν are conserved

 We can solve for r:

 Separating the variables, we obtain the equivalent of Eq. (3):12

 Because of conservation of angular momentum,

 d# = (h/r2)dt,

 1' The simplest approach is via the so-called Binet formula and by employing the exponential form of the

 trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. See Lange and Pierrus (2010), 237-43. The approach I choose here

 is interesting because of its similarities with Newton's.

 12 A positive root is chosen. The negative root corresponds to a time reversal t ->■ — t: if r(t) is a solution

 also r(—1) is a solution (depending on initial conditions).

 13 This is in contrast to the solution for inverse-square forces, a case in which the integration of (8) can

 only be obtained by means of transcendental functions, as underlined in Brackenridge (2003), 327.

 14 We note that in Cases 1 and 2, θ = θο corresponds to r = ro = -J(A2 — 2a)/IE and r = ro =

 yj(2a - h2)/2\E\, respectively. In Case 3, θ = Öq corresponds to the direction of an asymptote. In Cases
 4 and 5, θ = 0 corresponds to r = ro. Asymptotes for Cases 1 and 5 are easily calculated. For example, in
 Case 5, an asymptote occurs for θ = —h/iro^/lE).

 The first three cases are sometimes called "Cotesian" spirals. Case 4 is a logarithmic

 spiral. Case 5 is a "hyperbolic" spiral. Only the first two cases occur (other than circular

 trajectories) when the initial velocity is orthogonal to the radius vector, as required in

 Corollary 3.17 Cases 1 and 2 are discussed in the caption to Fig. 4. Newton identified

 Cases 1 and 2 in Corollary 3 and Case 4 in Proposition 9, Book 1. Johann Bernoulli

 identified Case 5 in Bernoulli (1710), 532-3. Roger Cotes classified all five trajectories
 in Cotes (1714).

 15 A solution using the sine function is also possible, but this does not generate a new family of trajectories

 because the sine function can be converted to a cosine by a shift of the polar coordinate. This, of course, is

 not true for the hyperbolic functions occurring in Cases 2 and 3 below.

 scattering state with pericentre at r;. In Case 2, the point mass describes a spiral that tends to the origin as

 r = (cos0.15ö)-1 andr = (coshO.50)-1

 5 Newton's geometric construction of inverse-cube trajectories

 It is time to go back to the original words of the master. So we can imagine being,
 like Gregory, in Newton's chambers with a page of the Principia in front of us, but

 frustratingly with our Notce with a lacuna to fill.

 5.1 Newton's construction

 We recall that Newton's construction as printed in the Principia (see Fig. 3 reproduced

 above) consists of the following.

 1. Draw two conics VRS, an ellipse (left) and a hyperbola (right), with centre C and

 2. A point R slides along the conic starting from V: draw the tangent at R meeting

 the axis CV at Τ.

 3. Draw the line CR.

 4. Draw a segment CP whose length is equal to CT and making an angle VCP with

 the axis CV proportional to the area of the conic sector VCR.

 5. The point Ρ traces the sought trajectory.

 Or in Newton's august words:

 If with centre C and principal vertex V any conic VRS is described, and from any point R of it

 the tangent RT is drawn so as to meet the axis CV, indefinitely produced, at point Γ; and, joining

 CR, there is drawn the straight line CP, which is equal to the abscissa CT and makes an angle VCP

 proportional to the sector VC/?; then, if a centripetal force inversely proportional to the cube of the

 distance of places from the centre tends towards that centre C, and the body leaves the place V with

 the proper velocity along a line perpendicular to the straight line CV, the body will move forward
 in the trajectory VPQ which point Ρ continually traces out; and therefore, if the conic VRS is a

 hyperbola, the body will descend to the centre. But if the conic is an ellipse, the body will ascend

 continually and will go off to infinity.

 And conversely, if the body leaves the place V with any velocity and, depending on whether the

 body has begun either to descend obliquely to the centre or to ascend obliquely from it, the figure

 VRS is either a hyperbola or an ellipse, the trajectory can be found by increasing or diminishing
 the angle VCP in some given ratio. But also, if the centripetal force is changed into a centrifugal

 force, the body will ascend obliquely in the trajectory VPQ, which is found by taking the angle VCP

 proportional to the elliptic sector VCR and by taking the length CP equal to the length CT, as above.

 All this follows from the foregoing proposition [41], by means of the quadrature of a certain curve,

 the finding of which, as being easy enough, 1 omit for the sake of brevity. (Newton 1999, 531-2)

 5.2 An algebraic translation

 But we are still fluctuating between past and present, and we might be tempted, before

 immersing ourselves in the mathematical culture of the late seventeenth century, to

 impart (for the sake of brevity, so to say) to Gregory a crash course in modern calculus

 and trigonometry to notice that the above construction delivers the solutions we named
 Cases 1 and 2 above.

 Let us use as Cartesian coordinates of the point R(x, υ) the abscissa χ and the

 ordinate υ (the origin is in the force centre C and the x-axis is vertical).

 As auxiliary conics, I introduce:

 x2 + v2 = 1,

 By construction, the polar coordinates of the body's position P(r, Θ) are r — CP —

 Equation (24) corresponds to the solutions we have classed as Cases 1 and 2 in Sect. 4.

 ries illustrated in Fig. 4.

 219

 (23)

 (24)

 5.3 An omitted method

 If we are to believe Newton, he achieved this construction thanks to "a method for

 squaring curvilinear figures" illustrated in the "foregoing Proposition [41]". By reading

 Corollary 3, we learn that it is this omitted method that allows him to square the
 curves dcx and abz, whose abscissa is the distance CD from the force centre and whose

 ordinates are Dc and Db [see Fig. 2, and Eqs. (1) and (2)]. We also learn from Fig. 3
 that Newton is making use of auxiliary conic sections.

 In the next section, we look at certain quadrature techniques that Newton developed

 in the mid-1660s, systematized in two "catalogues" dating from 1670, and then printed
 as "tables" in De quadratura. In a few words, we have to check whether these "more

 abstruse parts" in the Principia, as Gregory recorded in his July 1694 memorandum,
 depend upon those tables that aroused his admiration.21

 6 Some of Newton's quadrature techniques

 6.1 A digression into Newton's quadratures of conic sections

 Conic sections, as we shall see, played a prominent role in Newton's "quadrature

 techniques". The object of these techniques was to "square curvilinear figures," that

 is, to calculate the area of the surface bounded by plane curves.

 19 The trajectory is expressed in polar coordinates. So θ is an angle. Instead, we take VCR as the area of

 the circle and hyperbolic sectors, respectively.

 20 This must have been evident for Newton from Apollonius, Conics, 1.37. Apollonius of Perga (2000),
 65-7.

 21 This is an innovative element of my paper, since below I will detail the relationships between Corollary
 3 and Newton's quadrature techniques of the De methodis and De quadratura. These techniques date back
 to work Newton carried out in the 1660s.

 18 The choice of the auxiliary conics is crucial. Conies with different parameters give rise to different
 trajectories.

 220

 Ν. Guicciardini

 Since his youthful studies in the anni mirabiles (1664-6), Newton knew how to
 square conic sections via the binomial theorem and via an application of what nowa

 days we would call "term-wise integration".

 6.1.1 Logarithms

 So, for example, for the hyperbola, Newton wrote

 ν — (1 + x) 1 = 1 — χ + χ2 — x3 + χ 4 — · · · , (25)

 a result that he considered valid when χ is small. Newton knew that the area under

 the hyperbola and over the interval [0, x] for χ >0 (and the negative of this area
 when -1 < χ < 0) is a measure for ln(l + x). Thus, by (to speak anachronistically)

 "term-wise integration," Newton could express ln(l + x) as a power series:

 He did not, however, write that the above series is equal to "ln(l +x)". Until the mid

 eighteenth century, European mathematicians rarely used a notation for transcendental

 functions. They represented them via geometrical constructions, such as the hyperbolic

 surface in the case of the logarithm. Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli! were pioneers in

 developing a calculus for the logarithm and the exponential functions, but with the

 trigonometric or hyperbolic functions the general policy, before Euler, was to use

 geometric constructions (Katz 1987). Indeed, symbols for trigonometric magnitudes

 were known, yet in Newton's times calculus practitioners were used to handle them

 in terms of curvilinear areas or arc lengths.

 6.1.2 Transcendental functions and geometrical constructions

 We begin to understand why Newton expressed the solutions for Corollary 3 as a

 geometric construction. These solutions imply a functional dependence of the radius
 CP and the conic sector VCR expressed by transcendental relationships (the cosine

 and the hyperbolic cosine), and, according to an accepted convention, these were

 constructed geometrically until at least Euler's times

 The connection between quadratures and "transcendental functions"22 was pro
 found. Seventeenth-century mathematicians realized that while the slope of an

 algebraic curve is algebraic, most often the curvilinear area bounded by an algebraic

 curve (or the arc length) is not: it had to be expressed via an infinite series, as we have
 seen above.

 22 This is Leibniz's term, as Newton would use the Cartesian terminology "mechanical curves," and this

 (indeed) is a terminological distinction of great significance for the historian.

 we have to calculate the arc length s = LD (see Fig. 5). Newton envisaged the circum
 ference ADLE as being generated by the continuous "flow" of a point from Ε to A.
 The infinitesimal arc DH generated in a "moment" of time o, he called the "moment
 of the arc," and he denoted it as so.23 By geometrical reasoning, Newton knew that
 the moment of the arc DH is to the moment of the abscissa GH, as the radius DC = 1

 is to the ordinate DB = υ — Vi — χ2. In symbols:

 We would say that this series is equal to "arcsin(x)," but, as we know, this is not what
 Newton, Leibniz, or Johann Bernoulli would habitually do. The mathematicians active

 in late seventeenth-century Europe would say that the above series "approximates the

 arc whose sine is x". What came first was not the formula, but a functional relationship

 between geometrical magnitudes that was given by a construction, namely: by drawing

 a circle, by drawing a point on its circumference, and by tracing the abscissa χ and the

 23 Actually, Newton introduced the dot notation in the 1690s.

 If we set the hyperbolic sector VCR (Fig. 3) as equal to s/2, a result analogous to (28)

 arc length s. Newton noticed that as χ flows (what he called the "correlate quantity"),

 so does s (the "relate quantity") in a functionally related way. Once you have this

 geometrical relationship between magnitudes embedded in the given figure (a unit

 circle), you can ask yourself how to calculate the arc length s = LD (or equivalently

 the area of the circle sector s/2 = LCD) given the sine χ = CB. Since the functional

 relationship between the arc length and the sine is not algebraic, Newton made recourse
 to infinite series.

 6.1.4 The arccosh

 The quadrature of the circle that we have just reviewed is of great importance for

 the treatment of inverse-cube orbits, as is apparent if we consider the integrals (16).

 Further, Newton could extend the quadrature of the circle to the unit hyperbola

 χ2 — ν2 — I. (30)

 i 1
 - = -==. (31)
 X six1 - 1

 From this, we would derive in modern notation J dx/V*2 — 1 = arccosh(jc). The
 integrals (16) follow from (28) and (31) by a simple substitution of variables.24 To

 repeat: Newton did not use an integral sign or a notation for hyperbolic functions. For

 him formula (31) expressed a geometrical proportionality between the infinitesimal

 increments of the sector VCR and of the abscissa x. This proportionality allowed him

 to express the relationship between the abscissa (what we call the hyperbolic cosine)

 of point R and the hyperbolic sector VCR as an infinite series.

 6.1.5 A question

 Can we provide more evidence that Newton made a connection between his method of

 fluxions and an important proposition of the Principia such as Corollary 3? Indeed, we

 can, by looking attentively to a table of quadratures ("integrals," in Leibnzian terms)

 that he wrote in 1670 and later included in the draft version of De quadratura that

 Gregory inspected in 1694.

 6.2 Newton's quadratures "by means of finite equations"

 The so-called Demethodis serierum etfluxionum, composed in 1670-1 (Newton 1967

 1981, 3, 32-328), contains two "catalogues of curves" in which one finds tabulated

 the equations of several curves, divided into different "orders," and the "values of

 their areas". These catalogues were reprinted, with some variants, in De quadratura
 curvarutn,which Newton published as an appendix to the Opticks in 1704.25

 6.2.1 The fundamental theorem of calculus

 The first catalogue (see Fig. 6) is based on Newton's understanding of what we call the
 fundamental theorem of calculus (Newton 1967-1981, 3, 236^-1). In the mid-1660s,

 Newton, most probably inspired by Isaac Barrow, proved that, given a plane curve,
 the fluxion of the area bounded by this curve, by the abscissa, and by the ordinate, is

 to the fluxion of the abscissa as the ordinate is to 1. So, for example, with reference to

 Proposition 41, Newton would say that the fluxion of the area VabD is to the fluxion
 of the abscissa CD as the ordinate Db is to 1 (see Fig. 2). This insight immediately set

 him on the project of tabulating curves and their areas.

 The first catalogue of the De methodis summarizes some of Newton's results on
 quadratures (see Fig. 6). According to Newton's conventions, S, e, /, g are constants,

 and η can be a "positive or negative integer or fraction". The curves to be squared have
 abscissa ζ and ordinate v, while the areas of the surfaces they subtend are denoted by

 t or r. Most of the equations of the curves in the first catalogue involve radicals of the
 form R — +Je + f ζη or R = je + fzn + gz2η.

 6.2.2 A simple example

 Let us consider the first tabulated curve (see Fig. 6). Since we know that the fluxion
 of r = (8/η)ζη is τ = 8ζη~ι (assuming ζ = 1), Newton concluded that the "value

 25 I will not discuss the variants between the Catalogi divided into ordines of the De methodis and the
 Tabulae divided into formae of De quadratura, since they are not relevant for the thesis defended in this
 paper. According to an expert judge such as Whiteside: "The tables of integrals which Gregory saw were
 in fact [...] those which Newton introduced more than twenty years earlier into his general 1671 tract on

 fluxions and infinite series [the De methodis], rather than their lightly refashioned equivalent which he had
 much more recently appended to his revised text 'De quadratura curvarum'" Newton (1967-1981), 7, 197.

 fundamental theorem.

 6.2.3 A quadrature for Corollary 3

 For our purposes, the relevant quadrature occurs as the first in ordo quartus (see Fig. 7).

 The conics appear at the top of the table (Newton 1967-1981, 3, 242), and we imme

 diately recognize the auxiliary conics that Newton used in Corollary 3 of his Principia

 (see Fig. 8). The third figure from left is the auxiliary ellipse, and the last figure to the

 right is the auxiliary hyperbola. The lettering is different, but we easily realize that the

 This quadrature is what we need in order to square curve abz in Prop. 41 that determines

 the time in function of the radius for inverse-cube trajectories [set y'z — ydz = At,
 ζ = r, f — 2E and e = 2a — h2 and you obtain Eq. (12)].

 6.3 Newton's quadratures "by means of conic sections"

 A second catalogue of "curves related to conic sections" occurs in the De methodis a
 few pages later (Newton 1967-1981, 3,241-55). This catalogue too was republished,
 with some variants, in De quadratura, and Gregory must have seen a draft for the
 latter work. Basically, by appropriate substitutions of variables, Newton reduces the

 quadrature of a series of curves divided into several "orders" to the quadrature of conic
 sections.

 relevant conic sectors equivalent to VCR in Corollary 3 are here aGDA (ellipse) and

 PAD (hyperbola). We are on the right track.

 6.3.2 Substitution of variables

 We see (Fig. 9) that in this second catalogue there are four columns. The first column
 lists, as in the first catalogue, the equations of the curves to be squared divided into
 orders. As before, their abscissa is z, ordinate y, and area τ or t. Then, we have a
 second column where the reader learns how to change variable (today we would write
 x = f(z)). The next (third) column lists the equations of conic sections, with abscissa
 x, ordinate v, and area s. The sought area τ is expressed in terms of the conic area 5 in

 the fourth column (in Leibniz's notation, one would write τ = f ydz and s = f uck).
 As we know, Newton could square conic sections by means of infinite series that we

 would understand as the Taylor series of log, trigonometric, and hyperbolic functions.
 Indeed, the whole gist of De quadratura is the calculation of curvilinear areas (the
 "quadrature of curves") by means of infinite series.26

 26 This might be missed by a superficial reading.

 This is best explained by an example: the simplest is the first case of the first order,
 see (Fig. 9). We have to square

 With a change in variable ζη — x, the quadrature of the curve is reduced to the
 quadrature of a hyperbola ν — 8/(e + fx). Newton would write:

 δ xx 1 δ . 1 .

 yz = ~——— — = x = -vx, (35)

 and from this conclude that27

 and rather than write a symbol for the logarithm he would represent this transcendental
 magnitude geometrically in terms of the area subtended under a hyperbola aGDB (see

 the hyperbola, second from left, in Fig. 8).

 6.3.4 A quadrature for Corollary 3

 For our purposes, the relevant quadrature occurs as the first in ordo septimus (see
 Fig. 10).28 For η = 2, this translates into the statement that if a curve has equation

 227

 then its area is

 τ = —PAD or —aGDA, (39)

 2<5 2<5

 / /

 where PAD and aGDA are the conic sectors in Fig. 8.

 This quadrature is what we need in order to square curve dcx in Prop. 41 that

 determines the polar angle in function of the radius for inverse-cube trajectories [set
 yz = y&z = dθ, ζ = r,8 — h, f = 2E, and e = 2a - h2, and you obtain Eq. (13)].
 Note that the change in variable in the second column is very much the one we

 employed in the modern interlude in Sect. 4 [Eq. (14)]: Newton sets χ = \/z (equiv
 alent to our w = 1/r).

 In the third column, we find the equation of the auxiliary conics ν = J ex2 + /

 (e < 0 for the ellipse, e > 0 for the hyperbola).

 Via the change in variable indicated in second column, the required quadrature is

 reduced to a simpler form as follows:

 δζ _ Sx χ _ Sx

 y zy/fz2 + e J f/x2 + e*2 yjex2 + f

 In modern notation, this corresponds to reducing the sought integral, via substitution

 of variable, to an integral that we have already encountered in Sect. 4 in our modern
 solution [see Eq. (15)]:

 •Ιυπτ,-Ι

 V fz2 + e J s/ex2 + /

 dx

 (41)

 We integrated this in terms of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions [see Eq. (16)].

 Thus, for example, we would write (for e > 0):

 S [ = = -^=arccosh (.[^x \ + C. (42)
 J sfi VI f )

 But Newton, his contemporaries and immediate successors, as we know, did not

 express this quadrature in symbolic terms. Rather, they made recourse to a construction

 in terms of the auxiliary conics.

 The quadrature is provided in the fourth column as:

 28

 1
 -xv — s
 2

 T~1

 = -j PAD, (43)

 where 5 is the area of the surface subtended under the conic whose abscissa is χ and

 ordinate is v.29 Indeed, the absolute value of the difference between the area of the

 triangle with sides χ and υ and the area of the region subtended under the conic is

 29 Newton did not use the modern symbol for the absolute value | jxv — s| but rather one that he found in
 Barrow's works. Newton wrote -j- for "the Difference of two Quantities, when it is uncertain whether the

 latter should be subtracted from the former, or the former from the latter".

 equal to the area of the conic sector PAD, in terms of which Newton performs the

 required quadrature. Or, in modern symbols:30

 We note that for the conic v2 = ex2 + f (when again we take the hyperbola as our

 example, e > 0), the sector PAD has area equal to

 (44)

 (45)

 which makes Newton's geometric quadrature (43) equivalent to the modern analytic
 solution (42).

 We find the quadrature as tabulated in ordo septimus of the second catalogue, the

 very same curve, the very same substitution of variable, and the solution expressed in

 terms of the very same auxiliary conics in Newton's annotation for Gregory, written

 on 8 May 1694, to which we now turn at last. Newton was using his quadrature
 techniques in order to explain to his new friend a difficult (and very important for

 gravitation theory) part of the Principia.

 7 Newton's annotation for Gregory

 I provide an English translation (slightly adapted from Newton's Correspondence)
 and a commentary of Newton's annotation for Gregory dated 8 May 1694 (Newton

 1668-1694,351). It should be recalled that this is a quick note that was taken at the end

 of five very busy days. It was not meant for publication, but just to give a competent

 colleague a sufficiently detailed hint on how to proceed in order to fill the gap in the

 Noten. I take the liberty of altering Newton's words in a few inconsequential details.

 Namely, I use the symbol r, instead of x, and ζ, instead of z. This is done to spare

 my reader a headache, since the variables χ and ζ have already appeared in this paper

 with different meanings.

 7.1 Translation of Proposition 41 into algebra

 Newton opens the annotation as follows (see Fig. 11):

 30 To recapitulate. The first case of the seventh order translated into Leibnizian notation is as follows. For

 η = 2, Newton evaluates the integral J &/(zJe + fz2) dz (8, e, / constants). By substitution of variables

 Ζ — x~\ he reduces it to the conic area s = J vdx = J v/ + ex2 djc. Namely,

 τ-J ^jJL—äz = j\\xv-s\ + C = ^\l-xy/f + exl-Jy/f + exldx\ + C.

 CP = CT (Fig. p. 130) = CD — CI (p. 128) = r. DF is reciprocally as the cube
 of the altitude (by Hypothesis and Prop. 34) or = a4/r3 where any arbitrary a
 is assumed. Let AC — c; then the area ADFB = 2«4/r2 — 2a4/cc. And on that

 account the velocity of the falling body at D, or the revolving one at / (p. 128)
 or Ρ (p. 130), that is the length IΚ (p. 128), is as yj2a4/r2 — 2a4/c2 by Prop.
 39.

 Here, Newton is referring to two figures: one accompanying Proposition 41 on page

 128 (see Fig. 2) and the other accompanying Corollary 3 on page 130 (see Fig. 3) of his
 Principia. He is thus associating algebraic symbols with the lengths of the segments
 occurring in these two figures. The "altitude," which is the distance from the force

 centre, is denoted by x, but in the translation above we change it to r. The ordinate DF

 of the curve BFG, which in Fig. 2 represents the force's intensity, is set equal to a4/r3
 (it is thus an inverse-cube force). By the fundamental Propositions 39 and 40, Book
 1, Newton derives (by a very elementary quadrature) that the speed is proportional to
 v/2a4/r2 — 2a4/c2 (where c = CA is the position from which the body falls from
 rest in order to reach the initial speed at CV). That is, speed is proportional to the area

 ABFD (actually the factor 2 should appear in the denominator!).

 We note the following. Newton is here "preparing" his Proposition 41 in algebraic

 language in order to employ his quadrature techniques (below) in a more expeditious
 way. He uses the expression a4/r3 for the ordinate DF (an inverse-cube force). The
 constant a is raised to the fourth power, so that the ratio a4/r3 has the dimension of a

 length. Thus, Newton's algebraic language is attentive to geometrical interpretation.
 The last statement of this first excerpt is equivalent to what nowadays we understand

 as the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.

 7.2 Algebraic quadrature of curve abz

 The annotation continues as follows (see Fig. 12):

 By the law prescribed on p. 128 let Q be assumed and let Q/r — Ζ (p. 128):

 area VabD = ^~^2α4 - Q2 - ± a given

 = the sector VCI (p. 128) or VCP (p. 130) is proportional to the time. Therefore

 from CP or r, the given altitude of the revolving body, is given the sector VCP

 of the orbit which is sought, proportional to the time; and so the time is given in

 which the body attains that altitude.

 Here, Newton translates the fundamental "law" for the time in function of the radius

 [see Eq. (1)J. The time is given by the quadrature of the curve abz with ordinate Db
 (see Fig. 2) on page 128 of the Principia.

 For an inverse-cube force, this quadrature is particularly simple [in modern terms

 it is equivalent to Eq. (12)]. It takes the form:

 for 8 = (c2/2a4)Q/2, f — —2a4/c2, and e — 2a4 — Q2. This quadrature is ele
 mentary. But notice that Newton included it in the ordo quartus of his first catalogue
 of curves (see Fig. 7). This first catalogue is based on the idea that, as we would say
 nowadays, differentiation and integration are inverse operations. It is interesting to

 note that Newton does not forget to add a constant of integration.

 of the radius [see Eq. (2)] that occurs on page 128 of the Principia (see Fig. 2). Even at

 the beginning of the eighteenth century, this quadrature would have been considered
 a difficult one,

 For an inverse-cube force, Newton needs to square a curve with abscissa r and

 ordinate Dc. Since Q, CX, a and c, are constants, the curve that Newton has to square

 [an equivalent of the integral (13)] has the form:

 for <5 = (Q/2)CX2, / = —2a4/c2, e = 2a" — Q2. This form belongs to the ordo
 septimus of the second catalogue for η = 2 (see Fig. 10).

 Thus, Newton (as in the second column) proceeds with the variable substitution

 where e is set equal to the semi-major axis CV. This variable substitution is equivalent

 to our w = 1/r in Sect. 4 [Eq. (14)].

 Next, he introduces (as in the third column) the auxiliary conics [drawn at the

 bottom of the page (see Fig. 13)] with abscissa CR — ζ and ordinate

 (48)

 (49)

 Newton concludes with the construction (which we would express in terms of

 trigonometric and hyperbolic functions) prescribed in the fourth column of the seventh

 order of the second catalogue. Namely:

 1. the radius r is set equal to CT (and inversely proportional to ζ — CR),

 2. the polar angle VCP is set proportional to the sector VCS?2

 It should be stressed that Newton's recourse to a geometric construction for this

 "mechanical" ("transcendental," in Leibniz's terms) quadrature is typical of the math

 ematical culture adopted in Europe until Euler. For example, as Nauenberg has shown,

 Johann Bernoulli's solution of the inverse problem for inverse-square forces ends with

 a construction in terms of an auxiliary circle (Nauenberg 2010, 291-2).

 The annotation ends with two lines in Gregory's handwriting (see Fig. 14):

 To Corollary 3, Proposition 41, Book 1, page 130, in Newton's own hand 8 May
 1694.

 Gregory made a copy of this annotation that he later pasted in his Notce, filling a
 blank half-page that he had left in correspondence to Corollary 3 (see Fig. 1). The
 master had taught his disciple a lesson that was to remain hidden in Gregory's hands
 or available to his correspondents. There are reasons to believe that Gregory shared
 the content of his mathematical memoranda. For example, he may have circulated a
 short manuscript treatise on fluxions he composed in the autumn of 1694, another
 effect of his May encounter with Newton (Guicciardini 2009, 334). As late as 1714,

 the blind Lucasian Professor, Nicholas Saunderson, was writing about a proposal for
 publishing the Notae (Rigaud 1841, 1, 264-5).

 8 On translating and interpreting

 8.1 Two questions

 Newton's annotation for Gregory on Corollary 3 gives us some important information

 about the mathematical methods of the Principia. These methods were not exclusively

 based on a supposed "Newtonian style" framed in terms of "geometrical" limiting pro
 cedures.33 In some instances, when dealing with inverse-cube central force motion,
 the attraction of ellipsoids, resisted oscillation of pendulums, the solid of least resis

 tance, and in many astronomical parts of the third book, Newton deployed techniques
 that were an integral part of his algebraic method of fluxions.34 It should be stressed,

 33 The notion of a "Newtonian style" characterizing the Principia was forcefully defended by Francis De
 Gandt in his enjoyable and learned monograph (Gandt 1986).

 34 Gregory's Notce are a treasure trove of information on the relationships between the method of fluxions
 and Newton's Principia, something that might be missed upon superficial inspection. In many places
 Gregory refers to quadrature methods. Further, the Aberdeen exemplar of the Notes includes pages on
 Newton's celebrated treatment of the solid of least resistance, an extraordinary application of fluxions to
 a proposition of the second book of the Principia that Gregory also included in the manuscript treatise on
 fluxions he circulated in the mid-1690s ("Isaaci Newtoni Methodus Fluxionum; ubi Calculus Differentialis

 Leibnitij, et Methodus Tangentium Barrovij explicantur, et exemplis plurimis omnis generis illustrantur.

 Ν. Guicciardini

 however, that the methods employed in Corollary 3, and in the other instances listed

 above, are not representative of the whole Principia, a work that is characterized by

 a great variety of mathematical methods: some of these, but not all, were part of the

 method of series and fluxions. It is interesting to note that when Newton made recourse

 to quadrature techniques in the Principia, he did so in order to achieve results that were

 of utmost importance for the establishment of the theory of gravitation (Corollary 3

 was important for the theory of perturbations, Corollary 2 to Proposition 91, Book 1,

 for the study of the shape of the Earth).

 In the case considered in this paper, we have seen Newton employing quadrature

 techniques. These cannot be considered a marginal element of the method of fluxions.

 Seventeenth-century mathematicians were in possession of quadrature techniques

 based on approximation methods reminiscent of Archimedean exhaustion proofs. But

 this is not the case with the quadratures employed in Corollary 3: in the second half

 of the seventeenth century, these would have been considered as quite advanced and
 up-to-date.

 Indeed, the quadratures employed in Corollary 3 imply several features that we
 associate with "calculus" and "rational mechanics". These features are: the under

 standing of the fundamental theorem of calculus implied in the first catalogue, the

 algorithm for finding the fluxion of (differentiating) irrational equations (irrational

 functions) displayed in the first catalogue, the techniques of quadrature (integra
 tion) by means of substitution of variables displayed in the second catalogue, the
 calculation of slopes of tangents to curves and the use of the so-called character

 istic triangle (see Fig. 5), the handling of transcendental magnitudes in terms of

 infinite series such as the binomial theorem, the representation of the variation of

 physical magnitudes (such as the force's intensity) in terms of plane curves (graphs),
 and the use of infinitesimals "moments" (differentials) referred to the continuous

 variation of physical magnitudes. All the above elements are necessary ingredients
 that enabled Newton to write the annotation for Gregory. One might even claim

 that Newton knew how to solve the problem of central forces in terms of integra
 tions!

 Two interesting questions remain open.

 1. In what sense do Newton's methods differ from those deployed by Leibniz,

 Varignon, Johann Bernoulli, and Euler?35

 2. Why did Newton omit to explicitly formulate the fluxional techniques he employed

 in the Principia?36

 Cambridge University Library, Lucasian Papers [Res. 1894]: No. 13 and in the Macclesfield Collection,

 can be gathered, most notably, from Newton's manuscripts and his correspondence with Nicolas Fatio de
 Duillier and Roger Cotes.

 35 The classic works by Blay (1992) and Truesdell (1960), for example, are certainly very helpful for

 finding an answer. For a recent assessment, see Nauenberg (2010).

 36 As a matter of fact, Newton contemplated ending the Principia with an appendix on quadratures in the

 1690s, when revising the text, and again in the 1710s, when preparing the second edition of 1713. But in

 the end he resolved not to do so. It is only in the posthumous translation of 1729 due to Andrew Motte that

 235

 8.2 Translations

 The first question depends on a defining feature of the history of mathematics. As

 historians of mathematics, we are always, as is apparent from this paper, wrestling

 with the problem of translation. We are in possession of a contemporary mathematical

 language into which we can translate the language of the past. Indeed, we cannot

 forget our mathematics when we look at the mathematics of the past, or that of other

 cultures. It is a fact, depending on the robustness and universality of mathematics, that

 such translations are possible. Yet, as historians we are very much interested in those

 elements of past actors' languages that are "lost in translation," being peculiar to their

 idiosyncratic conception of mathematics.

 There are many differences between our mathematical language and Newton's. In

 physics, we use equations rather than proportionalities, and this leads us to deploy

 dimensional constants which the experimenters have to measure. We talk in terms

 of functions defined on number domains, rather than relations between geometrical

 magnitudes. We do not reduce problems to geometric "quadratures of curves," but to

 analytic integrations. We relate solutions of differential equations to initial conditions

 and ask ourselves questions of existence and uniqueness that in Newton's times were

 left to intuition. One might even claim that Newton's notion of "solution" was different

 from ours: in tackling the problem of central forces, he sought a construction of

 the trajectory, whereas we seek a class of functions (a general integral). We use a

 vector notation and algebra for directed magnitudes, while until the beginning of the

 nineteenth century mathematicians referred to and manipulated directed magnitudes

 via geometrical diagrams (e.g. we express the conservation of angular momentum in

 terms of a vector equation, whereas Newton demonstrated the conservation of areal

 velocity and the conservation of the orbital plane for central force motion in geometric

 terms). We deal with central forces in terms of a scalar potential energy U that is not
 to be found in Newton.

 To some twenty-first-century readers the annotation for Gregory we have analysed

 cannot but appear as a strange mixture of geometrical practice, physical insights,
 and dangerously ungrounded algebraic manipulations. The problem of translation,

 this switching back and forth between present and past languages, even somewhat

 frustrates our conviction about the universality of mathematics.

 However—and this makes history of mathematics an even more demanding

 enterprise—there are also other mathematical languages that soon clutter the his

 torian's desk: ones such as that of Euler, for example, which differ from, and yet

 are "equivalent to," Newton's. It is a worthy historiographical enterprise to attempt

 to understand how Euler and Lagrange improved on Newton, in what progress was

 made in passing from the Principia (1687) to the Mechanica (1736) and then from the

 Mechanica to the Mechanique Analitique (1788). From this perspective, the robust

 ness of the standard view must be recognized. Eighteenth-century mathematicians

 had to abandon Newton's quadratures and geometrical representation of transcenden

 Ν. Guicciardini

 tal magnitudes. The problems they tackled required them to do so: they transformed

 mechanics in such a way that the Principia became almost an object of curiosity, rather

 than a source of scientific inspiration.

 8.3 Comparisons

 As a telling example of the controversial issues of interpretation we encounter in

 comparing Newton's fluxional method to the Leibnizian calculus, I might refer to a

 passage in our modern treatment of inverse-cube trajectories in Sect. 4, namely the

 separation of variables that we perform in deducing Eq. (8) from Eq. (7). I will rewrite

 this passage, which is so standard for a modern reader that it is easy to forget the

 importance of this algorithm.

 Given (Eq. 7)

 r = — = ±Jl(E -U)- h2/r2,

 d/ v

 we wrote (Eq. 8)

 y/2(E - U) - h2/r2'

 It is this substitution of the dot notation with the differential one that allowed us to

 separate the variables.

 As Blay has taught us in his magisterial works, Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, Her

 mann, and Varignon (amongst others) algebraised time, velocity, and acceleration in

 terms of the Leibnizian calculus (Blay 1992). It is this algebrisation (in this case, the

 representation of radial speed as dr/dt) that allows the above separation of variables.

 Yet, we should recall the three following points.

 1. Newton could "square" the area VabD for an inverse-cube force (see Fig. 2) and

 thus obtain the algebraic function that expresses the functional dependence of time
 with radial distance in the inverse-cube case (as we have seen in Sect. 7). Thus, in

 his own way, he could tackle the representation of time and velocity necessary for

 the inverse problem of central forces in algebraic terms.

 2. Further, in his method of fluxions, Newton often understood a symbol such as χ to

 stand not for a finite speed, but rather for an infinitesimal increment, or "moment,"

 of the pertinent variable χ (an increment Leibniz would express with (be). This
 allowed Newton's immediate British followers, such as David Gregory, Roger

 Cotes, and Colin Maclaurin, who trod in Newton's steps, to write formulas that

 correspond to the ones employed by the Leibnizians. So, for example, the early

 practitioners of the fluxional method would represent, in Cartesian coordinates

 (x, y), the infinitesimal increment of the arc of a plane curve with s — λ/χ2 + y2

 (which, of course, would correspond to ds = y/dx2 + dy2). In this way, they

 were able to reproduce all the results on integration published by mathematicians

 such as Johann Bernoulli and Varignon in the Acta Eruditorum. In this context,

 237

 it should be noted that very soon those who employed Newton's notation learned

 to translate the Leibnizian differential representation of the velocity ν = άχ/άί
 in Newton's notation as ν = x/i. This notation allowed the early fluxionists to

 perform the separation of variables that we have just seen above.37 The idea that the
 Newtonian calculus lagged behind the Continental one because of an adherence

 to Newton's notation is a refutable myth.38

 3. Finally, one should not forget that the mathematicians working with Leibniz's

 notation in the early decades of the eighteenth century, remained anchored to

 a geometric interpretation of the differential magnitudes they manipulated. For

 example, they understood a symbol such as Ay/dx as representing a ratio between

 two geometric infinitesimal magnitudes. Their concern with geometric interpreta

 tion is revealed by the fact that, when writing a differential equation, they paid due

 attention to the geometric homogeneity of the left- and right-hand sides. To depict

 the fluxional method as "geometrical," in opposition to an "algebraic" differential

 calculus is an over-simplification.39

 Let us continue our little exercise of "comparative mathematical literature," so to

 speak. From a modern viewpoint, one might tackle central force motion as follows.

 The integration of Eq. (8)

 defines t in function of r [where we choose f(ro) = Oj. By inversion, the radial

 position in function of time, r (t), can be obtained. By using the conservation of angular
 momentum (9), the solution for θ is obtained as

 This leads to a complete solution of the determination of the trajectories [r(i), 0(01
 in a central force field.

 The above calculation is so familiar that we tend to forget that in the eighteenth

 century specific algorithmic tools and new concepts were developed to facilitate such

 manipulations. In this case, what makes the above procedure easy is the concept and

 37 For example, in Thomas Simpson's treatise on the method of fluxions, first printed in 1750, we read

 that "the Time wherein the Space χ would be uniformly described is known to be as χ/υ," (where υ is the

 velocity) and a few pages later this is applied to rectilinear accelerated motion in order to calculate the time

 Τ "by finding the fluent" of "Τ = χ/υ". This is, of course, in Leibnzian notation equivalent to dr = dx/υ.
 See Simpson (1750), pp. 244-6.

 38 The absence of a symbol equivalent to Leibniz's f is a well-known weakness of Newton's notation. In
 a few instances, Newton used to draw a square □; in most cases, he used words such as "the fluent of"

 or the "area of'. Some eighteenth-century British mathematicians mixed the two notations by writing, for

 example, f yx for J ydx. The use of an elongated / for "fluent of," rather than Leibniz's elongated s, /,
 for "summa" is also documented. Cajori (1929), 2, 244-6.

 39 On the "dual" character, algebraic and geometric, of differentiation in the early Leibnizian calculus, see
 Fraser (2003).

 notation for functions [such as r(t), 0(f)], and the expression of the law of areas
 (or, conservation of angular momentum) as a differential Eq. (9), rather than as a

 statement concerning the rate of increase in the area spanned by the radius vector.40 It

 is a fact, well known to historians of eighteenth-century mathematics, that the notion

 and notation for functions emerged in the middle of the century, mostly in relation to

 issues related to the integration of partial differential equations (such as the vibrating

 string equation).

 In the absence of a concept of function, Newton achieved the same result, but in

 a more cumbersome way. He required the squaring of two curves, corresponding to

 Eqs. (8) and (10). In his characteristic geometrical way of representing functional

 relationships, Newton had to refer to two areas VabD and VdcD and then state that

 the quadrature of these areas gives the time (represented by the area VCI swept by the

 radius vector) in function of the distance from the force centre, and the polar angle

 (represented by the area of the circle sector VCX) in function of the distance from the
 force centre.

 8.4 Re-enactments

 As I said above, the historian wishes to recapture, to re-enact, what has been lost in the

 progress so masterfully recounted by Blay and Truesdell. It is undeniable that Leibniz,

 Varignon, Bernoulli, and Euler produced an algorithm and obtained results in the

 integration of differential equations applied to mechanics that are superiorto Newton's.

 However, Newton's mixing of geometrical intuition and algebra possesses its own

 beauty and conceptual depth. There was progress in passing from Newton to, say,

 Lagrange, but also a loss. In writing the history of the mathematization of mechanics,

 as historians we are interested in recapturing what has been "lost in translation". This

 is important mostly because what is lost is often what is peculiar and idiosyncratic:

 what is revealing of the author's intent and agenda. In our interpretative work, we have

 thus to translate and compare the languages of past actors, in an attempt to understand

 what they wished to achieve, as Newton did, by choosing an austere Euclidean style

 when printing a volume on the mathematical principles of natural philosophy, when

 addressing a question posed by a frustrated visitor, or when omitting a quadrature "for

 the sake of brevity".

 8.5 Interpretations

 As to the second question. It seems as though Newton used a public language in which

 he printed his magnum opus, and a private language with his acolytes, whenever they
 asked for clarifications. This bifurcation between esoteric and exoteric mathematics

 40 We note that angular momentum is a vector quantity, so it is also the direction of the vector (or equivalently

 the fact that the motion is planar) that must be taken into consideration. Before the advent of vector notation

 at the beginning of the nineteenth century (another conceptual shift to which corresponds the introduction

 of yet another mathematical language), the constancy in orientation of the angular momentum for central

 force motion could only be expressed in terms that in some crucial way referred to the geometrical features
 of the orbit.

 is a fascinating aspect of Newton's policy of publication that cannot be dealt within

 the limits of this paper. Tentative answers can be reached only by broadening the field

 of historical enquiry. One has to consider what the intended audience of the author of

 the Principia might have been, how the choice of a public mathematical style became

 part of his self-fashioning in the republic of letters as a staunch anti-Cartesian, how

 and why the algebraic method of fluxions became a source of anxiety for a natural

 philosopher who regarded himself as an heir to the Ancients, rather than as a follower
 of the "men of recent times."41

 8.6 Invitation

 One of the aims of this paper is to suggest that the vexed question of Newton's use of

 calculus in the Principia still deserves our attention and might lead to "good" historical

 questions, such as the two we have just considered, which bypass as irrelevant the

 animosity and partisanship that have muddied the waters since the Newton-Leibniz

 controversy giving rise to a "standard view" that polarizes Newton's use of "geometry"

 in the Principia and the Continental "rational mechanics" in an all too simplistic

 way.

 Questions of priority have often polarized the attention of historians of mathemat

 ics. These questions are, however, ill chosen since they are based on the idea that

 in the development of mathematics there exist objects (such as theories, theorems,

 concepts, methods) that can be found by a single discoverer. From this point of view,

 the historian's task would be to lend credit to single individuals. But the develop

 ment of mathematics is a much more complex phenomenon, and the application of

 calculus to mechanics is no exception. It would be a gross exaggeration to say that

 Newton founded, or anticipated, the mechanics of Euler and Lagrange. Yet, it would

 be equally wrong to think that Newton and his acolytes were extraneous to a treatment
 of mechanics in terms of calculus.

 If our programme is aimed at "rediscovering the rational mechanics of the Age
 of Reason," as Truesdell put it in his seminal paper that initiated the influential his

 tory of this journal (Truesdell 1960), then we have to accept a more complex image
 of the establishment of rational mechanics, and include Newton and the Newtonians

 within a picture that the standard view depicts as a purely Continental story spanning
 from Leibniz to Euler. Indeed, Newton and his British followers often contributed

 results in analytic mechanics that were shared with the Continentals, sometimes in

 a polemic context, as even a fleeting perusal of the Bernoulli correspondence at the

 University Library in Basel reveals. One might cite, without any claim to exhaus

 tiveness: Cotes's study on the inverse-cube trajectories, Taylor's work on the vibrating

 string, Stirling's and Maclaurin's theorems on the gravitational attraction of ellipsoids.

 The viewpoint I suggest leads to further questions with which it may be apposite

 to conclude this paper: What did Newton mean by calculus, or by the method of

 series and fluxions? How did he apply it to mechanics? What publication policy did

 he follow in printing the Principia? How did he privately communicate his results

 41 I have discussed this issue in Guicciardini (2009).

 consider his views on mathematical method and publication practices? A serious

 study of these questions might shed light on an important chapter of the history of
 mathematics.
