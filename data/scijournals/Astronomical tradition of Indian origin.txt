 Abstract In this paper, we analyze the astronomical tables in al-Zij al-Muqtabis by
 Ibn al-Kammâd (early twelfth century, Côrdoba), based on the Latin and Hebrew

 versions of the lost Arabic original, each of which is extant in a unique manuscript.

 We present excerpts of many tables and pay careful attention to their structure and

 underlying parameters. The main focus, however, is on the impact al-Muqtabis had

 on the astronomy that developed in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghrib and, more

 generally, on the transmission and diffusion of Indian astronomy in the West after
 the arrival of al-Khwârizml's astronomical tables in al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) in

 the tenth century. This tradition of Indian origin competed with the Greek tradition

 represented by al-Battânï's astronomical tables and was much more alive in the Iberian

 Peninsula and the Maghrib than previously thought. From Spain, the Indian tradition

 entered mainstream European astronomy, where we find echoes of it in all versions

 of the Alfonsine Tables, both in manuscript and in the printed editions (beginning in

 1483), as well as in Copernicus's De Revolutionibus, published in 1543.

 More than 20 years ago, we published in this journal a long paper on a set of astronom

 ical tables in al-Zîj al-Muqtabis compiled by Ibn al-Kammâd, an astronomer active

 in Cordoba at the very beginning of the twelfth century (Chabâs and Goldstein 1994).

 In that paper, we focused on the tables in this zij and, by means of analyzing their

 structure and determining the underlying parameters, we identified some of Ibn al

 Kammâd's sources and situated this zij in a long tradition going back to Indian and

 Greek astronomy. We are now able to elaborate our previous arguments, based on

 new material and new insights into old material produced in the Iberian Peninsula

 and beyond. Specifically, we can better assess the impact of Ibn al-Kammâd's work

 on western astronomers, with an emphasis on his role in transmitting astronomical

 procedures and parameters of Indian origin.

 The case of Ibn al-Kammâd, although not exceptional, is paradigmatic of the history

 of western astronomy in the Middle Ages in that it exemplifies the main lines of its

 development: elaboration of astronomical theories and procedures based on Ptolemaic

 and non-Ptolemaic materials in the eastern Islamic world, transmission from the early

 Islamic milieu to the West, reworking in al-Andalus of the material received, diffusion

 and use of it in the Iberian Peninsula in different cultural and religious contexts, and

 translation into others languages (Latin and Hebrew in this instance).

 Abu Jacfar Ahmad ben Yusuf Ibn al-Kammâd was probably born in Seville and

 worked in Cordoba. In the anonymous thirteenth-century version of Ibn Ishâq's zij

 preserved in a fourteenth-century copy, Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh State Library, MS

 298 (no foliation), we are told in chapter 35 that "Abu l-c Abbâs [Ibn] al-Kammâd said

 in a horoscope he drew in Cordoba in the year 510 Hijra...". This date corresponds
 to 1116-17 A.D. (cf. Mestres 1996, p. 404). He is said to have been a disciple of
 Azarquiel, and indeed, several of the tables analyzed below depend on Azarquiel (d.

 1100). Most of the little information known about Ibn al-Kammâd was assembled by

 Comes (2007). He is the author of three zijes (al-Kawr calâ l-dawr, al-Amad calâ l

 abad, and al-Muqtabis) as well as of an astrological work on the duration of pregnancy,

 called Kitâb Mafâtih al-asrâr (Book of the keys to the secrets), which Vernet identified

 in 1949 in El Escorial, Biblioteca del Monasterio, MS Arabe 939, but the manuscript
 only contains chapters 10-15 of that work. According to Comes, Baghdad Museum,

 MS 296 [782], includes another Arabic text by Ibn al-Kammâd, hitherto not examined

 in detail. The first two zijes are not extant in any language, but al-Kawr calâ l-dawr

 (The periodic rotations) is partially preserved in the same El Escorial manuscript, as
 well as in a long quotation in the zij of Ibn Ishâq (Mestres 1996, pp. 392, 405-406).

 On the other hand, al-Amad caid l-abad (The eternally valid [tables]) is not extant at

 all. There is also a short text in Castilian in Segovia, Biblioteca de la Catedral, MS

 115, entitled Libro sobre çircunferencia de moto and attributed to Yuçaf Benacomed,

 that may belong to one of these two zijes.

 The third zij composed by Ibn al-Kammâd, al-Muqtabis, is probably a summary

 of the first two. It is the only extant in Latin and Hebrew versions: Madrid, Biblio
 teca Nacional, MS 10023 (Millâs 1942, pp. 231-247; see a digital reproduction at
 http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer. vm?id=0000014503&page=l), and Vatican, MS Heb. 498

 (Langermann 1984, and Richler 2008, p. 428). In this paper, MS M denotes the Latin

 manuscript in Madrid and MS F denotes the Hebrew manuscript in the Vatican: each

 version is extant in a unique copy. The Latin version is due to an otherwise unknown

 John of Dumpno, in 1260 in Palermo, as stated in the explicit (f. 18vb):

 Et perfectafitit translatio et interpretatio istarum portarum in Panormitana ciui

 tate per Johanem de Dumpno filium quondam Philipii de Dumpno, die ueneris

 21 mensis augusti 4 indicione ab annis Domini et Saluatoris nostri Ihesu Xristi

 1260. Et concordatus est cum ipsis annis nonus decimus dies mensis ramadan ab

 annis seductionis 658, sub laude et gloria omnipotentis Dei et Saluatoris nostri

 Ihesu Christi feliciter, amen. Explicit.

 In the canons, Ibn al-Kammàd does not refer to any source of Indian origin. The

 canons in Latin are divided into 30 chapters (ff. lra-18vb), each of them called porta;

 the last chapter mentions the other two zijes by Ibn al-Kammàd, al-Kawr calâ l-dawr

 and al-Amad °alâ l-abad, thus indicating that al-Muqtabis was written after the other

 two. In Arabic, only chapter 28 has survived (Algiers, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS
 1454, and El Escorial, MS 939: see Comes 2007). After the canons follows a set of

 chapters (18vb-23rb), some of which are associated with al-Kawr calâ l-dawr. A new

 explicit repeats the name of the translator, John of Dumpno, and the city of Palermo,

 but the date is now 1262. Folios 23v-24r contain another similar text followed by

 notes, and ff. 24v-26v are blank. The tables of al-Muqtabis are found on ff. 27r-54v,
 after which there are some additional tables (55r-66r); see below.

 The author of the Hebrew version, Solomon Franco (fl. 1375), was active in Cordoba

 and Toledo (Langermann 1993, pp. 31,41-42). Little is known about him, but he does

 say in a supercommentary on Abraham Ibn Ezra's Biblical commentary that he studied

 with Joseph Ibn Waqàr (fourteenth century, Castile) whose zij is cited extensively in

 this paper (see below). In addition to astronomy, his interests included astrology and

 magic (see Goldstein 2013). Franco's version of al-Muqtabis is uniquely preserved in
 MS F: canons (ff. 2r-19r) and tables (ff. 29r-68v); the introduction to his canons was

 edited and translated in Goldstein (2013). He provides rules and tables for converting

 dates among Jewish, Christian, and Muslim calendars that apparently were not part

 of Ibn al-Kammâd's zij; otherwise, the tables in MS F mostly agree with those in
 MS M, but for textual variants. Moreover, we believe that the two extant versions are

 independent witnesses to the original Arabic.

 As is the case with most zijes, the sources of al-Muqtabis are multiple, but among

 them stand out those of the Sindhind tradition that drew on Indian sources, to the point

 that this zij by Ibn al-Kammâd is a crucial link in the transmission of Indian astronomy

 to the West. Although the dominant tradition in medieval astronomy derives from

 Ptolemy's Almagest, there are other elements involved, but their history is difficult

 to trace. The reason is that some of the astronomical texts of late antiquity are not
 extant, and this is also the case for most of the astronomical texts produced in the

 Islamic world in the eighth and early ninth centuries. As reconstructed on the basis

 of later sources, the dominant astronomical traditions in early Islam were of Indian

 origin, later displaced for the most part by Greek traditions. This was particularly true

 in the eastern Islamic world, whereas many of the Indian traditions were maintained

 throughout the Middle Ages in the West (in Arabic in al-Andalus and the Maghrib,

 and subsequently in Latin in western Europe, and in Hebrew). An added difficulty is
 that few medieval astronomers identified their sources: this task has been undertaken

 by modern scholars whose works will be cited in this paper. For the Indian traditions

 in the Islamic world in the eighth and ninth centuries, we depend on the fruits of this

 scholarly endeavor. Our principal goal is to describe the continued presence of Indian

 traditions in medieval Spain, based largely on the zij of Ibn al-Kammâd and related
 texts.

 Early Arabic astronomers were influenced by a series of texts produced in India

 in the fifth to the seventh centuries. The works we will cite are the Sûrya-Siddhânta,
 based on Burgess's translation (1860), and the Khandakhâdyaka by Brahmagupta
 (seventh century), based on Sengupta's translation (1934). The history of the text of

 the Sûrya-Siddhânta is complex, and we only note that the earliest version (not extant)

 is dated ca. 450 (Pingree 1968a, p. 29; Neugebauer and Pingree (eds. and trans.) 1970,

 1:13). Fragments of the eighth-century zijes by al-Fazârï and by Yacqub Ibn Târiq

 that tell us about the early Indian traditions in the Islamic world were collected by

 Pingree (1968b and 1970). Moreover, some aspects of Indian astronomy reached the

 Islamic world by an indirect route, for they were first transmitted to Iran at the time

 of the Sasanian dynasty (226-652). These traditions were included in the Zîj al-Shâh,

 composed ca. 450 and revised in the sixth and seventh centuries; they only survive in

 fragments preserved by later Islamic astronomers (Kennedy 1958, and Pingree 1963,

 p. 242; cf. Goldstein and Sawyer 1977, p. 168). For a fanciful medieval account of the

 transmission of Indian astronomy to the court of the first Abbasid caliph, al-Saffah
 (reigned: 750-754), see Goldstein (1967a), pp. 147-149; for an assessment of the
 historicity of this passage, see Pingree (1970), pp. 101-102. For an overview of Indian

 astronomy, see Pingree (1978).

 The most important astronomical work in this tradition, called the Sindhind zij,

 was composed by Muhammad ibn Miisâ al-Khwârizml (fl. 840, Baghdad), but it is

 not extant in its original form. The tables in this version were based on the era of the

 last king of the Sasanian dynasty, Yazdegird III (epoch: June 16, 632). Subsequently,

 they were recast to the era of the Hijra (epoch: July 15,622) by Maslama al-Majrîtï (d.

 1007, Cordoba); this version is also not extant. However, Maslama's version survives

 in a Latin translation by Adelard of Bath (ca. 1080-ca. 1150), which was published by

 Heinrich Suter in 1914 and translated in Neugebauer (1962a). This version is known on

 the basis of nine manuscripts: two of them are complete copies and reasonably close to

 Adelard's original, but the others are either incomplete or attributed to Petrus Alfonsi

 or Robert of Chester (Mercier 1987, p. 89). Other information on al-Khwàrizmï's zij

 comes from a commentary by the tenth-century astronomer, Ahmad Ibn al-Muthannà,

 probably working in al-Andalus, which only survives in Hebrew and Latin translations

 (Goldstein 1967a, and Millâs Vendrell 1963). Another extant commentary is by Ibn

 Masrûr (tenth century, Cairo). Both commentaries were written prior to the composi

 tion of Maslama's version, that is, they refer to the original form of al-Khwàrizmï's
 zij (van Dalen 1996, pp. 198-200; Pingree 1996; Haddad et al. 1981, pp. 224-225;
 Samsô [1992] 2011, pp. 84-91). All versions of this zij used sidereal coordinates

 for the positions of the celestial bodies in contrast to the tropical coordinates used

 in the Almagest. In this essay, we refer to the extant version by Maslama simply as

 al-Khwârizmï's zij.

 In al-Andalus, in addition to those who depended on Ibn al-Kammàd, several authors

 used al-Khwàrizmfs Sindhind zij, either directly or by means of Maslama's recension

 (see King, Samsô and Goldstein 2001, p. 56). Among them is Ibn al-Saffar (d. 1035),

 who was a disciple of Maslama and active in Cordoba and Denia. He wrote a book on

 the use of the astrolabe and composed a zij of which only seven chapters are extant

 (Paris, MS Heb. 1102): see Castells and Samsô (1995). Ibn al-Samh (d. 1035), another

 disciple of Maslama, worked in Granada and wrote several texts on mathematics,

 as well as treatises on the construction and use of the astrolabe and the equatorium

 (Rius 2007, p. 568). His zij, also in the tradition of al-Khwàrizmï, is not extant (see

 Samsô [1992] 2011, pp. 85, 87). The third author, Ibn Mucâdh (d. 1093), from Jaén,

 compiled a zij known as Tabulae Jahen of which the Arabic original is not extant, but

 the text of the canons has been preserved in a Latin translation by Gerard of Cremona,

 entitled Liber tabularum Iahen cum regulis suis, printed in 1549 with the title Scriptum

 antiquum saraceni cuiusdam (Heller 1549, ff. Ν i r - Ζ ii r). The author of the underlying

 Arabic text was identified by Moritz Steinschneider (1863, pp. 10-11), but his findings

 were ignored, for the most part, in subsequent literature. As Steinschneider noted, the

 author's name appears as Abumadh (ch. 23, f. X i r) and as Abumad (ch. 25, f. X iiij v),

 which are corrupt forms of Ibn Mucâdh. According to the canons, Ibn Mucàdh adapted

 the zij of al-Khwârizmï to the coordinates of his city and used some parameters that

 come from the Indian tradition that are not found in Ibn al-Kammâd's zij. On Ibn
 Mucâdh, see Hermelink (1964), Goldstein (1977), Villuendas (1979), Samsô (1980,
 1994, 1996), Smith and Goldstein (1993), Casulleras (2010), and Samsô [1992] 2011,
 pp. 152-166,484-487.

 Of particular interest is a twelfth-century incomplete copy of al-Khwârizmï's zij,

 extant in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS 16208, that contains tables for

 the mean motions, equations, and latitudes of the planets (for a description of this

 manuscript, see Pedersen 2002, pp. 165-166). For instance, the maximum equations

 for the Sun and the Moon in this short set of tables are 2;14° and 4;56°, respectively,

 which are parameters of Indian origin used by al-Khwârizmï. The radices are computed

 for dates in the Julian calendar, beginning in 1100 and, according to Mercier (1987,

 p. 101), it would seem that the computations were intended for Toledo.

 The impact of the Indian tradition in al-Andalus was not restricted to the compilation

 of zijes, for it can also be discerned in the Almanac of 1307. This almanac, of which the

 original in Arabic is lost, was briefly described by Millâs (1949, pp. 388-390), based
 on a Latin translation made in Tortosa that is extant in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional,

 MS 17961. Subsequently, this text has been called the "Almanac of Tortosa" but, since
 other versions of it in Latin, Castilian, Catalan, Hebrew, and Portuguese have been

 identified, this designation is no longer appropriate (Chabâs 1996b). The Almanac

 of 1307 uses sidereal coordinates and, in addition to tables specific to an almanac

 for the positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets for varying numbers of years

 beginning in 1307, it also contains tables commonly found in zijes, such as tables for

 mean motions and equations, as well as lists of the positions of the planetary apogees

 and nodes. The Almanac of 1307 had a long life for, in various manuscripts, there is

 a continuation of it beginning in 1391 (Chabâs 1996b).

 Another direct user of the Sindhind of al-Khwârizmï was Abu 1-Hasan cAlï al

 Qusantïnï (or Qusuntïnï), a fourteenth-century astronomer working in Fez, who

 composed a zij containing various elements of Indian origin, with an explanatory

 text in verse [Kennedy and King 1982; cf. King, Samsô and Goldstein (2001, p. 63)].

 In al-Andalus and the Maghrib, and later in Christian Spain and Portugal, a sig

 nificant number of astronomers, especially table makers, depended directly on Ibn
 al-Kammâd.

 The zij of Ibn Ishâq al-Tûnisï (ca. 1193-1222, Tunis and Marrakesh) only survives

 in a version composed by an anonymous author active in Tlinis around 1280: it is

 extant in Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh State Library, MS 298, a manuscript copied in

 1317 in the city of Homs, Syria. According to Mestres (1999, pp. 5-6), the sources of

 Ibn Ishâq's zij include the zij of al-Khwârizmî, the Toledan Tables, and Azarquiel's
 works, and among the astronomers who used it were Ibn al-Bannâ' (1256—1321,

 Marrrakesh), Ibn al-Raqqàm (d. 1315, Tunis and Granada), Ibn Waqàr (mentioned
 above), and the astronomers in the service of King Alfonso X. In the preface to this

 work, the anonymous author indicated that Ibn Ishâq's zij depended on the works of

 Ibn al-Kammâd, Ibn al-Hà'im (thirteenth century, Seville), Ibn Mucâdh, and Ibn al

 Saffar, among others (Mestres 1999, p. 7). Moreover, we note that many of the canons

 of Ibn Ishâq's zij in the Hyderabad manuscript were taken from, or follow closely,

 those of al-Muqtabis. In this essay, we generally refer to the anonymous recension in

 the Hyderabad manuscript simply as the zij of Ibn Ishâq.

 Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica, MS Pal. lat. 1414 is a late thirteenth-century man

 uscript containing the Toledan Tables, the Almanach of Azarquiel, as well as tables

 for Toulouse, and notes for Paris (for a description of this manuscript, see Pedersen

 2002, p. 178-179). It also contains a table of sines, normed 150 (see Sect. 2.1, below),

 a table for the ascensional difference in the tradition of al-Khwârizmî (see Chabâs and

 Goldstein 2012, p. 30, Table 2.6A; Neugebauer and Schmidt 1952, pp. 225-227), and

 8 tables on eclipses already in al-Muqtabis, as well as a summary of chapter 7 of the

 zij (ff. 140v-143r). At the present time, it is the only known example of the use of

 Ibn al-Kammâd's tables in Latin and the only text in Latin dependent on al-Muqtabis
 other than MS M.

 The impact of Ibn al-Kammâd's works or, more generally, of astronomy of Indian

 origin, can be traced in various zijes composed in the Iberian Peninsula during the

 fourteenth century. One of them is the Tables of Barcelona, extant in Hebrew, Latin,

 and Catalan versions, which consist of a set of tables compiled for the meridian of that

 city and a text accompanying them. The author, Jacob Corsuno, a Jew from Seville, had

 been called to Barcelona by King Pere el Cerimoniôs (1319-1387) for that purpose.

 The tables use sidereal coordinates for the positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the

 planets; their epoch is March 1,1321, and they are arranged according to the Christian
 calendar (Millâs 1962; Chabâs 1996a).

 Two astronomers in the Jewish community of the Iberian Peninsula, both of whom

 lived in the fourteenth century, were followers of Ibn al-Kammâd: Juan Gil of Bur

 gos, whose zij in Hebrew is only extant in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 23078

 (formerly London, Jews College, MS 135) [MS G]; and Joseph Ibn Waqâr, whose zij

 is preserved in Arabic in Hebrew characters in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek,

 MS Heb. 230 [MS W]. (Note that throughout this essay, we refer to the old foliation

 of MS G, which is in Hebrew characters.) Little is known about Juan Gil: in a passage

 in MS G 14b-15a, introduced by the phrase "the copyist (ha-mactiq) said," the author

 is identified as Juan Gil (MS G 15a: 1) and Abu Jacfar [Ibn] al-Kammâd's Muqtabis is

 mentioned (14b:-3). Juan Gil has been identified with the person with the same name in

 documents of the Archives of the Crown of Aragon dated 1350-1352 (Rubiô y Lluch

 1908, pp. 155, 164), and who is cited in two astrological texts in Judeo-Portuguese
 (Gonzalez Llubera 1953); see also Beaujouan (1969), p. 11. Moreover, a note taken

 from an astrological text by Juan Gil is preserved in Paris MS Heb. 1031, f. 207b. The

 epoch for the tables in this zij is 1310 of the Spanish Era (MS G 62b, 75b, et passim),

 which is equivalent to 1273 A.D. (The epoch of the Spanish Era is January 1, -37 =
 JDN 1707544: see Neugebauer 1962a, p. 82.) See also Chabâs and Goldstein (1997,
 2015, pp. 43-44).

 Joseph Ibn Waqàr of Toledo was a member of a prominent Jewish family; his zij was

 composed in Arabic in 761 A.H. = 1359/60 A.D. (MS W 4b: 13—14), and the canons

 were translated by the author himself into Hebrew (MS W 4a: 16: both versions are
 preserved in MS W): see Steinschneider (1893), pp. 598-599; Castells (1996). The
 author's name is given in MS W la:2,4a: 17, and 13b: 1, and the epoch for the tables
 is 720 A.H. = 1320/21 A.D. (MS W 20a). The zij, al-Kawr, composed by Ibn al
 Kammàd, is mentioned in MS W 4a: 10-11 and 20a: 1. See also Chabâs and Goldstein

 (1997, 2015, pp. 44-45).

 The anonymous zij, uniquely extant in Vatican, MS Heb. 384, ff. 263a-278b, has
 as its epoch 1400 A.D. It includes a number of double-argument tables for plane
 tary corrections, and astrological tables are notably absent. There is no indication of

 familiarity with the Parisian Astronomical Tables that were dominant in Europe at the

 time outside the Iberian Peninsula, and the zij that it most closely resembles is that

 of Judah ben Verga (see below). Some of the tables in this zij are in the tradition of

 Ibn al-Kammàd, notably a table for trepidation and a table for the solar equation. For
 details, see Goldstein (2003).

 In the fifteenth century, Judah ben Verga, active in Lisbon from about 1455-1475,

 compiled a zij called Huqqot Shamayim (Ordinances of the Heavens), in which he

 described an observation he made of an autumnal equinox in September 1456 and

 compared it with a similar observation by Ptolemy in order to determine the length of

 the tropical year. In his solar equation table, he depended on Ibn al-Kammâd (Goldstein

 2001, pp. 232,244-245,267-269). However, generally, it has been difficult to establish

 the exact relationship of this zij with others in the late Middle Ages.

 And then, there are a few elements typically of Indian origin that entered the

 mainstream tradition of European astronomy in the Middle Ages. One of them is

 the approach given to lunar latitude as a function of the argument of lunar latitude,
 with a maximum value of 4;30°, as in al-Khwârizmï's zij. This parameter is found

 in many tables such as the Tables of Barcelona and the zij of Abu 1-Hasan CA1T al

 Qusantïnï, among others. In the fourteenth century, Jacob ben David Bonjorn, the

 author of a set of tables for syzygies (conjunctions and oppositions of the Sun and

 the Moon) beginning in 1361 and computed for the city of Perpignan, used this par
 ticular parameter in his tables for eclipses (Chabâs 1991, 1992). So in the fifteenth

 century did Abraham Zacut, who compiled in Salamanca a lengthy zij (ha-Hibbur ha

 Gadol), with epoch 1473 (Chabâs and Goldstein 2000). Another element in the Indian

 tradition which is found in western astronomy is the parameter associated with the

 lunar anomaly, namely a maximum equation of 4;56°. In the Iberian Peninsula and the

 Maghrib, this parameter was used in the zijes of Ibn Mucâdh, Ibn Ishâq, Abu 1-Hasan

 cAlï al-Qusantïnï, and the Almanac of 1307, to cite a few, and in the Latin world by the

 astronomers in the service of King Alfonso, as well as in the tables of John Vimond

 (Paris, ca. 1320) and the Parisian Alfonsine Tables, the most widely disseminated set

 of tables in the late Middle Ages throughout Europe (editio princeps: Venice, 1483),

 among others. For us, this is a clear indication that the Parisian Alfonsine Tables of the

 early fourteenth century were a significant vehicle for the transmission of the Iberian

 tradition to the rest of Europe. Moreover, through the Aifonsine Tables, this parameter

 for the lunar equation, 4;56°, was even used by Copernicus {De Rev. IV. 11) who, in

 this respect, belongs to this long Indian tradition.

 I Chronology and calendars

 MS M 27r-v

 The purpose of the tables is to convert dates from the Arabic calendar to the "Roman"

 (i.e., Julian) and Egyptian calendars. As indicated in the canons accompanying the

 tables, the epoch is the Hijra, given as noon, "the day of Mercury" (Wednesday), cor

 responding to noon, July 14,622 A.D. : "Know that the radix used in this canon for each

 of the motions of the centers and the arguments is noon, Wednesday, that preceded the

 Thursday on which day is the [first day of] Muharram in the first year of the Hijra"

 [Scias quia radicales positi in hoc canone in singulis motibus centrorum et argumen

 torum sunt positi super circulo meridiei diei Mercurii qui praecesserat diem Jovis in

 quo die Jovis intraverat Almuharram in primo anno annorum seductionis...] (MS M

 6r, chapter 9 of the canons). The date mentioned in the text requires an explanation.

 According to al-BIrûnï (Sachau 1879, p. 34), in 17 A.H. the Caliph cUmar declared

 the epoch of the Hijra era to be Thursday, corresponding to July 15, 622 A.D. The

 convention for the beginning of the civil day in the Hijra calendar is sunset, and the

 correspondence with the Julian date is for the day that begins at midnight following

 that sunset. Hence, the beginning of Thursday, Muharram 1,1 A.H. took place at sunset

 of Wednesday, July 14, 622 A.D. However, the astronomical convention, beginning
 with Ptolemy, is that the day begins at noon. For Muslim astronomers, this was taken

 to mean that the epoch of the Hijra took place on Wednesday, noon, preceding the

 civil day, Thursday, that began about 6 hours later (as is stated in the canons to Ibn
 al-Kammâd's tables), but see the comments on Table 1, below. In this passage and

 elsewhere in the canons and the tables, the Arabic expression for "years of the Hijra"

 has been translated into Latin as anni seductionis. The term in Latin for the Hijra is

 unusual, but it occurs elsewhere in this manuscript (see, e.g., MS M 35r, below). We

 note that both seductio and the Arabic root of Hijra can mean "separation." To be sure,

 Hijra in this context refers to Muhammad's "emigration" from Mecca to Medina. In

 MS F (e.g., 39r), the corresponding expression in Hebrew is li-tehillat perat hagar,

 meaning (literally) "for the beginning of the era of Hagar," where Hagar represents

 the Arabs (as the mother of Ishmael in the Hebrew Bible). This meaning of the term

 perat is unusual: see Goldstein (2013), pp. 176-178.

 The main table displays the correspondence among three calendars (see Table 1).

 The entry 932 Julian years 9 months 17;0days [= 932 χ 365.25 + 9 χ 30+17;0 =

 340700 days] corresponds to the time interval from the beginning of the Seleucid era

 (October 1,-311; JDN = 1607739) to the Hijra, whereas the entry 9 Egyptian years

 II months 9 day s [= 9 χ 365 + 11 χ 30+9 = 3624 days] is the time interval between

 the Hijra and the beginning of the Yazdegird era (June 16, 632; JDN = 1952063).
 If we consider the dates given here for the epochs of the Seleucid and the Yazdegird

 eras to be correct, then the date for the Hijra underlying this table is Thursday, July

 15,622 (JDN = 1948439 = 1607739 + 340700 = 1952063 - 3624), despite what is
 indicated in the canons to these tables.

 These tables in MS M entirely, or partially, reproduce calendrical tables in the

 zij of al-Khwârizmï (Suter 1914, pp. 110-113), and/or in the tables associated with
 al-Battânï but now attributed to Maslama (Nallino 1903-1907, 2: 301, 304-305).

 MS F 29r-32v

 Displayed here are tables for the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian calendars that were

 added to the text of Ibn al-Kammâd by the translator, Solomon Franco. The Jewish

 calendar is called the years of Adam, the Muslim calendar is called the years of Hagar,

 and the Christian calendar is called the years of Edom (see Goldstein 2013). A note on

 f. 29r indicates that the beginning of Muharram 780 A.H. corresponds to the beginning

 of Iyar 5138 A.M. (= April 29,1378).

 It is worth noting that chapter 2 (conversion of dates from the Muslim calendar to the

 Byzantine calendar and vice versa, through calculation) of the canons in Hyderabad,

 Andra Pradesh State Library, MS 298, reproduces word for word fragments of the

 canons in Latin of al-Muqtabis. Moreover, other chapters, also on calendrical matters,

 follow closely these canons (Mestres 1999, pp. 16-23). Furthermore, the first two

 tables in the Hyderabad manuscript are identical with the first two tables in al-Muqtabis
 (Mercier 1996, pp. 420-421).

 2 Trigonometry and spherical astronomy

 2.1 Functions related to the Sine

 MS M 46v; MS F 54v

 Three trigonometric functions are tabulated (see Table 2), and for each integer degree
 we are given Sin θ = 60 sin Θ, Cos θ = 60 cos Θ, and Vers θ = 60 - Cos θ =

 60 (1 - cos#)· All three functions are normed for R = 60 and, following Kennedy

 (1956a, pp. 139-140), we have capitalized the first letter of their abbreviations. The

 Almanac of Azarquiel (Millâs 1943-50, p. 229) has a table with these three functions,

 but given at intervals of 3°. Except for copying errors, the entries in both manuscripts
 of al-Muqtabis agree.

 The sine function and its derivatives are characteristic of Indian astronomy; in

 ancient Greek astronomy, one had to depend on the chord function which, while

 equivalent to the sine function, is much clumsier to use ["the chord function was (...)

 replaced by the sine in even the most ancient of extant [Indian] texts," Van Brummelen
 (2009), p. 95]:

 Sin θ = l/2Crd2<9.

 For a chord table, see Almagest 1.11.

 The norm used here (60) differs from that in al-Khwârizmï's zij (150), a norm

 previously used in Brahmagupta's Khandakhâdyaka (655 A.D.); see Pingree (1976),
 p. 160.

 Note that in MS F there is no column for the Versine: meytar is used for Sine and

 takhlit ha-meytar for Cosine. This table with the three functions is also found in the

 set of tables of Juan Gil, only extant in MS G 105b-106a, with the title: Table of Sines

 [mishcanim\, Versines [hissim], and Cosine [mishcan ha-hashlama].1

 Examples of Western tables with sines normed 150 abound: see a list of manu
 scripts associated with the Toledan Tables (Pedersen 2002, pp. 946-954), as well as

 others, e.g., Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS 7316A, f. 116r, and Vatican,
 Biblioteca Apostolica, MS Pal. lat. 1414, ff. 90r-91r, containing Ibn al-Kammàd's

 tables for eclipses.

 Chapter 19 of the canons of Ibn Ishâq's zij is taken from canon 17 of al-Muqtabis

 and, according to Mestres, the six tables corresponding to the functions related to the

 sine in the Hyderabad manuscript probably go back to one of the two lost zijes by Ibn

 al-Kammâd of which al-Muqtabis is a summary (Mestres 1999, p. 60).

 This table displays the solar declination for each integer degree of the argument, the
 solar longitude (see Table 3). The entries reach a maximum of 23;33° at 90°. This

 value for the obliquity of the ecliptic is associated with the Mumtahan zij (see Vernet

 1956, p. 515, and Kennedy 1956a, p. 145). MS F displays the same table, with minor
 variants. The modern formula for the declination, <5, is

 8 = arcsin(sinÀ χ sine),

 where λ is the longitude, and ε is the obliquity. The maximum declination is the

 obliquity of the ecliptic, that is, the angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator.

 This tradition for tables of declination is also found, with variants, in other sets of

 tables, such as those by Juan Gil (MS G 89b), Ibn Waqâr (MS W 55a) and the Tables
 of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, pp. 194-195, and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 499-500), as well as

 in the calendar of Peter of Saint Omer (Pedersen 1983-84, p. 347). For a list of some

 historical values of the obliquity, see Chabâs and Goldstein (2012), pp. 22-24.

 2.3 Cotangent function

 MS M 48r; MS F 57r

 The heading for this table in MS M is Tabula umbre et altitudinis (Table of shadows

 and altitude); the entries represent the length of a shadow, s, projected by a gnomon
 of 12 units as a function of the altitude of the Sun, h, based on the formula

 s = 12cotan h,

 where the cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function (see Table 4).

 The corresponding table in MS F has minor variants.

 Juan Gil included this table in his zij (MS G 107a), as is also the case for the Tables

 of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, p. 235, and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 502-504; see also Chabâs
 and Goldstein 2012, p. 25).

 2.4 Normed right ascension

 MS M 48v-49r; MS F 55r

 This table gives the right ascension, increased by 90°, in degrees and minutes as
 a function of the longitude, beginning at Capricorn 0°; there is a column for each

 zodiacal sign (see Table 5). The right ascension, a, for a given celestial longitude, λ,
 is defined as follows:

 where S is the declination of a given λ, and ε is the obliquity of the ecliptic. The

 normed right ascension, a', is defined as:

 sin a = tan 6/tan ε

 a' = a + 90°.

 The same table for normed right ascension is found in al-Battânï's zij (Nallino

 1903-1907, 2:61-64), for an obliquity of 23;35°, but differs from that in the Handy

 Tables (Stahlman 1959, pp. 206-209) and that in al-Khwàrizmï's zij (Suter 1914, pp.

 171-173), both calculated for higher values of the obliquity.

 As deduced from this table, the rising times of the individual signs are as follows:

 32; 13° for Capricorn, Cancer, Sagittarius, and Gemini

 27;50° for Aries, Pisces, Virgo, and Libra

 29;54° for Taurus, Aquarius, Leo, and Scorpio

 2.5 Oblique ascension for Cordoba

 MS M 49v-5 lr; MS F 55v-56r

 In this table, we are given the oblique ascension for Cordoba, latitude 38;30°, as
 explicitly stated in the heading of the Hebrew manuscript. As was the case for right

 ascension, there is a column for each zodiacal sign; here, the first column corresponds

 to Aries, rather than to Capricorn. In these tables, there are also columns for the length

 of the diurnal seasonal hours, defined as one twelfth of the time from sunrise to sunset

 at a given location on a given day of the year (or a given solar longitude).

 The occurrence of a table for Cordoba in this zij is probably a sign that Ibn al

 Kammâd depended on the version of the zij of al-Khwârizmï made by Maslama for
 Côrdoba (see Table 6).

 The rising times of the individual signs deduced from this table are as follows:

 18;25° for Aries and 18;45° for Pisces

 21;48° for Taurus and 21;29° for Aquarius

 29; 19° for Gemini and Capricorn

 The surprising results for the rising times of Pisces and Aquarius derive from an

 erroneous entry for Aqr 30° = Psc 0° (341 ; 15° in MS M). MS F has the correct value,
 341;35°.

 The entries for diurnal seasonal hours reach a maximum of 18;24° at Cancer 0°, a

 value which is in good agreement with the entry for the half-length of daylight, 7;21h,

 displayed in another table for Cordoba in MS M 47ν (see below). Indeed, 18;24 χ

 12/15 = 14;43h, which yields a value for the half-daylight of 7;21,30h.

 When recomputing the entries, close, although not exact, agreement is obtained with

 φ = 38;30° and ε = 23;51°; this value for the obliquity produces better agreement
 than the values found in our text (23;33° and 23; 35°).

 2.6 Oblique ascension for cities other than Cordoba

 Each of the followers of Ibn al-Kammâd presented tables for the oblique ascension for

 their own cities. Juan Gil (MS G 100b-101b) has a table for Burgos (latitude 42; 18° : G
 148b), which includes columns for the seasonal hours. The Tables of Barcelona (Millâs

 1962, pp. 222-223, and Chabâs 1996a, p. 502) have no such table for Cordoba, but one
 for Barcelona. The data for diurnal seasonal hours are presented in a separate table.

 Ibn Waqâr (MS W 53a) has a table for the oblique ascension for Toledo. The latitude

 is not specified there, but in a table for geographical coordinates on f. 59a, it is given

 as 40;0°, whereas in a table for lunar parallax on f. 54a it is given as 39;55°. There

 are no columns for the seasonal hours in Ibn Waqàr's table. For excerpts from tables

 of oblique ascension, see Table 7.

 MS M 59v-61r displays a similar table, including columns for the seasonal hours,

 for Salé, a place in North Africa near Rabat, whose latitude is given here as 33°.

 MS F has three other tables for the oblique ascensions. On ff. 63v-64r, there is a

 table for the city of Seville whose latitude is given as 37; 15°, and it includes entries for

 the length of seasonal hours. Its maximum value is 18; 18°, corresponding to a longest

 daylight of 14;38h. On ff. 64v-65r, there is another table for the horizon of a city

 whose latitude is 41 ; 510 (Zaragoza). The maximum value for the length of a seasonal

 hour is 18; 49°, which corresponds to a longest daylight of 15;3h, precisely the number

 appearing in the heading. The third table is on ff. 65v-66r. As indicated in the heading,

 it is valid for the city of Toledo whose latitude is 40; 0°; the maximum value for the

 length of a seasonal hour is 18; 34°, which corresponds to a longest daylight of 14;5 lh.

 2.7 Length of daylight for Cordoba

 MS M 47ν; MS F 56v

 This table gives the half-length of daylight in Cordoba, as indicated in the heading in

 both manuscripts, at intervals of one degree of the argument, as a function of the solar

 longitude. The table begins at Capricorn (see Table 8).

 The maximum entry represents half of the longest daylight (M/2), and it is 7;21h

 for Cancer 0°. This value follows from the formula:

 ten φ = -cos (Μ/2) χ cote,

 where φ = 38;30° and ε = 23;33°.

 2.8 Tangent function

 MS M 48r: "Tabula directionis arcus luminis et transitus"; MS F 68r: Table for the

 correction of the arc of light.

 The argument in this table is given in degrees at 3°-intervals from 3° to 90° (with

 some copying errors). In MS M, columns 2 and 3 are headed "directio arcus luminis"

 and "minuta diuersitatis transitus," whereas in MS F they are headed "Correction for

 the arc of light" and "minutes of the crossing and the difference," respectively (see

 Table 9). Column 2 has entries in degrees and minutes, and column 3, in minutes and

 seconds. A very similar table is found, but with entries to seconds in both columns,

 in the Almanac of Azarquiel (Millâs 1943-50, p. 226). However, the headings for the

 columns in the latter are quite different from those here.

 Column 2 represents the tangent function. More specifically, the tabulated function

 is y = 5 χ tan x, where the coefficient 5 has to be understood as 60/12. Note, however,

 that the entry for 45° is erroneously given as 4;40° instead of 5;0°. The entry for 90°,

 given as 1507;0°, actually corresponds to an argument of 89;49°. This is one of the

 very few examples in zijes from al-Andalus of the tangent function, already used by

 Habash al-Hâsib with base R = 1 (Debarnot 1987, p. 62). Besides this table and the

 analogous one in the Almanac of Azarquiel, we only know of one other in the Kitâb

 majhûlât of Ibn Mucâdh al-Jayyânï, from Jaén (eleventh century), where the tabulated

 function is the quotient of the sine and the cosine of the same angle, and the entries are

 given to seconds (Villuendas 1979, p. 118; Samsô 1980, pp. 60-68). All three tables

 date from about the same time. Two examples of the use of this auxiliary table, given

 at intervals of 1°, are known among Maghribi astronomers; Ibn Ishâq (Mestres 1999,

 pp. 275 and 278) and Ibn al-Raqqâm in his three zijes, Shâmil, Qawïm, and Mustawfi
 (Samsô 2014, p. 323).

 The tangent function is used to determine the ascensional difference, γ, of a celestial

 body whose longitude is λ at a geographical latitude φ. As explained by Neugebauer,
 following the instructions given in the Sûrya-Siddhânta ii.60-63, one needs first to

 define a "small circle of the Sun," that is, a circle parallel to the equator on which the

 Sun moves during one day when its longitude is λ (see Neugebauer 1962a, pp. 50-51,
 and Burgess (trans.) [1860] 1935, pp. 101-102; cf. Goldstein 1967a, pp. 78-80, 204
 205, and Pingree 1968b, p. 123). The ascensional difference is called "equation of

 daylight" by al-Bïrûnï (see Lesley 1957, p. 123), which corresponds to the headings in

 MSS M and F. It was computed by means of verbal instructions, which are equivalent
 to the modern formula

 Sin y = so (R/g)tan<5,

 where so is the length of the equinoctial noon shadow of a gnomon of height g, and <5

 is the declination of the Sun. In the expression above, so is the only element depending

 on φ, whereas (R/g) tan S depends on λ only and can therefore be used for all climates.

 When R = 60 and g = 12, (R/g) tan (5 reduces to 5 χ tan S, which is the function

 tabulated in column 2. Finally, the length of daylight (or, "arc of light") in equatorial

 degrees, when the Sun is at a given λ, is 180° + 2y (γ is positive for 0° < λ < 180°,

 and negative for 180° < λ < 360°). To justify this formula, see Fig. 1. The standard

 formula for y in spherical right triangle EGR is:

 sin γ = tan<$ χ tamp.

 This is equivalent to the previous formula, for Sin y = R sin γ, and so/g = tan φ.
 The maximum in column 3 is 0;23,33°, which is a sixtieth of the value for the

 obliquity of the ecliptic used by Ibn al-Kammàd. Although the agreement is not very

 good, we think it likely that the entries in this table are SI60, where S is the declination.

 This table is also found in the Almanac of Azarquiel (Millâs 1943-50, p. 226), and

 in the two zijes of Ibn al-Raqqâm, Qawîm and Mustawfl, where it is called nisbat al

 mamarrât (Samsô 2014, p. 322). We have not succeeded in determining the purpose

 for which column 3 of this table was computed.

 Among the tables in this manuscript that do not belong to al-Muqtabis, there is

 one (MS M 59r) with the title "Tabula partis cordarum supereminentium et partis

 almudarat solis et planetarum" (see Table 10). It has three columns, the first being for

 the argument at intervals of 1° from 1° to 90°. The other two columns display entries

 for the auxiliary functions y = 5 χ tan jc (here called pars cordarum supereminentium)

 and y = 1 / cos jc (i.e., the secant function, here called pars almudarat)·, these entries

 differ from those in Table 9. In contrast to Table 9, the entry for 45° is correct in the

 case of the tangent. Note that the entry for 60° in the column for the secant should be

 2;0°. However, the corresponding entry in the zij of Ibn al-Bannâ', where the table is

 called nisbat al-madârât, is also 2; 1° (King 2004, p. 132). The column for the secant

 function is also found in the Almanac of Azarquiel, at intervals of 3° of the argument,

 where the entry for sec 60° is given as 2;0,56° (Millâs 1943-50, p. 226). The same

 table, with its three columns, is reproduced by two other Maghribi astronomers, at

 intervals of 1°: Ibn Ishâq (Mestres 1999, pp. 275 and 278-281) and Ibn al-Raqqâm in

 his three zijes, Shâmil, Qawïm, and Mustawft (Samsô 2014, p. 323). As reported by

 King, both authors give 2; 1° for sec 60°.

 3 Equation of time

 MS M 46r; MS F 59r

 The entries in this table are given in time degrees, rounded to the nearest integer, and

 the maximum, 8°, occurs at Sco 2°-12° in the Latin manuscript and at Sco 2°-14° in
 the Hebrew manuscript (see Table 11).

 In MS M, beneath the table, we read: "Mediatus solis in radice posita ad direc

 tionem dierum cum noctibus: 10.23.24.50. a puncto capitis arietis," whose meaning
 is not entirely clear. It probably refers to a position of the mean Sun, which has to

 be understood as 10s 23; 24,50°, corrected for the equation of time. Elsewhere in this

 manuscript, the term directio means equation: see, e.g., MS M 35v. The entries in the

 table may have been taken from the more precise values given in the zij of al-Battânï

 (Nallino 1903-1907,2:61-64; preserved in the Toledan Tables: Toomer 1968, pp. 34

 35; Pedersen 2002, pp. 968-983), displayed in time degrees, that differ substantially

 from those in the zij of al-Khwàrizmï (Suter 1914, pp. 181-182), where they are given
 in hours, minutes, and seconds.

 The same table is found in the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, p. 224, and Chabâs

 1996a, p. 505). Juan Gil gives four tables for the equation of time: two "according to

 Abu Jacfar al-Kammâd" (MS G 94b-95a), one with entries in degrees and minutes and

 the other with entries in minutes and seconds of an hour; two other tables "according

 to the author" (MS G 95b-96a), one with entries in degrees and minutes and the other
 with entries in minutes and seconds of an hour.

 The equation of time is given either in time degrees or in minutes of an hour, where

 1° = 0;4h. In the zij of Ibn Waqàr, the equation of time is given in minutes of an hour,

 as the heading of the table specifies (MS W 36a). The argument is for 1° and multiples

 of 6°, to 30° in each zodiacal sign. The entries (disregarding the units) are 4 times the

 corresponding entries in Table 11 ; it is therefore most likely that Table 11 underlies
 this table.

 4 Trepidation and apogees

 4.1 Trepidation

 In al-Muqtabis there are two tables for trepidation: one displays a constant motion of

 0;5,24,32°/y (where y corresponds to an Arabic year) for the first point of Aries (see

 Table 12) and the other gives its equation, representing a variable motion that reaches
 a maximum of 9; 59° (see Table 13).

 MS M 28v, "Tabula aduenctionis puncti capitis arietis"; MS F 33r, Table for the motion

 of the head of Aries on the circle of access [ha-qadima] and recess [ha-ihur]

 Both manuscripts display entries to seconds and give the same radix, 3;51,11°.

 Note that the entries are for years and months in the Hijra calendar: the entry for

 collected years includes the radix and the entry for 90 collected years is obtained by

 adding the radix (3;51,11°) to the entry for 90 expanded years. The same radix and

 equivalent entries for the mean motion of the vernal point are found in Azarquiel's

 Treatise on the motion of the fixed stars (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France,
 MS Heb. 1036; see Millâs 1943-50, pp. 266, 324), where the entries are given to

 sexagesimal fourths. The treatise by Azarquiel seems to be a direct antecedent of
 Ibn al-Kammâd's table. The Liber de motu octave sphere attributed to Thâbit Ibn

 idation associated with Azarquiel, where arcsin (10;24/60) = 9;58,54° is very close

 to the maximum value in this table, 9;59° at 90° (Chabâs and Goldstein 1994, pp. 24

 27; for a similar table see Toomer 1968, p. 118; and Pedersen 2002, pp. 1552-1554).

 This table is also found in the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, pp. 194-195, table

 20(3), and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 487-489), in a treatise by al-Marrâkushï (J.-J. Sédillot

 and L.-A. Sédillot 1834, p. 131), and in the tables of Juan Gil (MS G 78b). A table

 based on the same formula is found in Ibn al-Raqqâm's Mustawfi zij (Samso 2014, p.
 314).

 4.2 Solar apogee

 MS M 35r has a table headed, "Tabula directionis centri solis et augis eius ad pri

 mordium annorum seductionis" (Table for the equation of center for the Sun and its

 apogee for the beginning of the years of the Hijra). The longitude of the solar apogee

 for the Hijra is given above the heading, as "Aux" 2s 16;45,21°. Likewise, in MS F

 39v, which displays a table for the equation of the Sun, the same value is given for the

 solar apogee, presumably for the beginning of the Hijra era.

 The value of the solar apogee for the Hijra given in al-Muqtabis differs from the
 corresponding value in the zij of al-Khwârizmî, 2s 17;55° (see Neugebauer 1962a,

 p. 19) which, in turn, came from the Zïj al-Shâh and ultimately from Indian sources

 (Pingree 1965). In contrast, Ibn Mucàdh of Jaén retained al-Khwârizmï's parameter

 (see Samsô [1992] 2011, p. 154). There are two values for the solar apogee in Latin

 texts attributed to Thâbit Ibn Qurra: 2s 20;45° and 2s 22;55° (Neugebauer 1962b, pp.

 266 and 286). Brahmagupta's value for the solar apogee was 2s 20°, later corrected
 to 2s 17° (Sengupta (trans.) 1934, pp. 13 and 139). For the solar apogee of 2s 20° in

 an Indian astronomical work composed in the sixth century, see also Neugebauer and
 Pingree (ed. and trans.) 1970, 1:93 and 2:69.

 The Almanac of 1307 gives the solar apogee as Gem 19;6° (Madrid, Biblioteca

 Nacional, MS 3349, f. 54v) and Gem 10;6° (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 17961,

 ff. 6lr and 90v). The first value differs from that of Ibn al-Kammâd by 2;21° and

 from that of al-Khwârizmî in 1 ; 11°, whereas the second value is probably a copyist's

 error: with the proper motion of 0;0,0,2,2,14,46°/d embedded in Ibn al-Kammàd'zij
 (see Sect.5.2, below), the solar apogee progresses 2;21,31° in the time interval
 between the Hijra and the beginning of 1307 (March 1), demonstrating that the

 position of the solar apogee in the Almanac of 1307 depends on Ibn al-Kammàd's

 parameters.

 For Juan Gil, the position of the solar apogee is 2s 18; 46° (MS G 79a). In the Tables
 of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, pp. 192-193, and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 487-489), the solar

 apogee for the "first year of King Pere of Aragon" (1321) is given is 2s 19;25,55° in

 Ripoll, MS 21, and 2s 19; 30° in Vatican, MS Heb. 356. In MS W 36b, in the table for

 the solar equation given by Ibn Waqàr, the equation is 0° for longitude 2s 19° exactly,

 which is therefore the solar apogee (very nearly the same value as in the Tables of
 Barcelona). It should be noted that the epoch for Ibn Waqàr's tables is 720 A.H.,

 corresponding to 1320/21 A.D.

 The longitude of the solar apogee at epoch in the zij of Ibn °Azzuz (fourteenth

 century, Fez) is 2s 16;44,21°, i.e., one minute less than Ibn al-Kammâd's value (Samsô

 1997, pp. 82, 102).

 4.3 Planetary apogees

 Both in MSS M and F, the values for the apogees of the planets appear in the headings
 of the tables for the planetary equations (M 37v-44v; F 42r-49r): see Table 14.

 We note, first, that three of the values in MS M differ from those in MS F by 0;0,30°;

 second, that the value given for Venus agrees exactly with that for the Sun; and third,

 that these values do not correspond to those given in the zij of al-Khwârizmï (Suter

 1914, pp. 14-15, Neugebauer 1962a, pp. 41 and 99), where the apogees of the Sun and

 Venus differ. The planetary apogees at epoch in the zij of Ibn cAzzuz are identical to

 those in MS F (with the variant that agrees with MS M), which suggests that here MS

 F is the better witness to the original text of Ibn al-Kammàd (see Samsô 1997, p. 102).
 The planetary apogees given in the Almanac of 1307 (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional,

 MS 3349, f. 54v, and MS 17961, ff. 61r and 90v) are as follows:

 Saturn

 Jupiter
 Mars

 Venus

 Mercury

 Sgr 20;55° = 260;55°
 Vir 22;32° = 172;32°
 Leo 8;24° = 128;24°
 Gem 21;15° = 81;15°
 Sco 14;54° = 224;54°

 In this case, the five values agree with those in the zij of al-Khwârizmï (Suter 1914,

 pp. 14-15, Neugebauer 1962a, pp. 41 and 99), except for Saturn, where al-Khwârizmï

 has Sgr 4; 55°. Note that the solar apogee (see Sect. 4.2) depends instead on that of Ibn

 al-Kammàd. Therefore, in the Almanac of 1307 the solar apogee was given a proper

 motion according to Ibn al-Kammâd, whereas the apogees of the five planets were
 assigned their positions for the Hijra according to al-Khwârizmï.

 The apogees in the zij of Abu 1-Hasan cAlï al-Qusantïnï (fourteenth century, Fez)

 are all slightly greater than those of Ibn al-Kammâd, and the apogees of the Sun and
 Venus are identical (Kennedy and King 1982, p. 10):

 a With Vatican, MS Heb. 379; Vatican, MS Heb. 356 reads 3s 21 ;3°, and Ripoll, MS 21, omits the entry

 The values for the planetary apogees at epoch in the Tables of Barcelona (1321) are

 closely related to those in al-Muqtabis, for the differences between the corresponding
 values of the apogees are all about 2;42°(±0;2°): see Chabâs (1996a), pp. 496-497.
 The values in MS W are simply rounded from the values in the Tables of Barcelona.

 While the significance of the parameter 2;42°(±0;2°) is unclear, it does indicate that

 for the compilers of these tables the planetary apogees have a proper motion (cf. Samsô
 and E. Millâs 1998, pp. 268-269) (Table 15).

 5 Mean motions

 The headings of the tables indicate that they were intended for the meridian of Cordoba

 and calculated for Arabic years, months, etc. The tabulated values for the mean motions

 are given to seconds for the solar center, the longitude of the solar apogee, the longitude

 of the vernal point, and the lunar center, and to minutes for the rest of the 16 quantities
 considered (see Table 16).

 5.1 Sun

 MS M 28r; MS F 32v

 The entries for the solar center in Table 17 do not agree with either al-Khwârizmï

 (Suter 1914, p. 115), or al-Battànï (Nallino 1903-1907, 2:20). Note that the entries

 for collected years incorporate the value of the radix. This is readily seen by checking

 the entry for, say, 720years, 7s 16;13,19°, which results from adding to the radix eight

 times the entry for 90 expanded years, 3s 23;42,14°. This is indeed the case, although

 the result obtained, 7s 16;13,1 °, is close but not in exact agreement (the entry in MS F,

 3s 23;42,17°, gives a closer result). With these uncertainties in the table, the underlying

 daily mean motion of the Sun is 0;59,8,9,21,15,...°/d, and it yields a year-length of

 365;15,36,34,...d, which is sidereal. This value for the mean solar motion happens to

 be the difference between the corresponding value attributed to Azarquiel, which is
 also embedded in the Toledan Tables (0;59,8,ll,28,27,...°/d), and Azarquiel's value

 for the daily motion of the solar apogee (0;0,0,2,7,10,39,... °/d; see Toomer 1969, p.
 319).

 For related values for the mean motion of the Sun, see Sects. 15.1 and 16.4.

 * It is uncommon to tabulate the motion in anomaly of an outer planet since the longitude of the Sun is

 equal to the sum of the planet's apogee, its mean center, and its mean anomaly

 ** The location of the lunar node between the tables for the mean motions of Venus and Mercury, in both

 MSS M and F, is unusual but the reason, most probably, was to maintain the format for the other planets
 where two quantities are listed on each page (center and anomaly). It is also unusual to have tables for the

 motion of Mercury's center since, in principle, they should be identical with those for the Sun

 The Almanac of 1307 has a table for the daily mean motion of the Sun, Venus,
 and Mercury (Madrid, Biblioteca National, MS 3349, f. 54r, and MS 17961, ff. 61r

 and 90v), where the first entry, 0;59,8,9,21°/d, agrees nicely with that embedded

 in al-Muqtabis. As will be seen below, the same occurs with the mean motion of the

 Moon and the planets (see Sects. 5.3 and 5.4).

 Among his tables, Juan Gil has one (MS G 76b-77a) for the motion of the Sun

 in collected years of 152(= 19 χ 8) years, from 0 to 199 cycles. In the following

 table (MS G 77a-78b), Juan Gil gives the motion of the Sun in single years from 1

 to 152, and for each day of the month in a year beginning on March 1. For cycle 0

 the entry is 0s 0;0°, for cycle 1 the entry is lis 28;30°, for cycle 2 it is lis 27;0°,

 and so on. Computation from these entries yields a daily mean motion of the Sun of

 0;59,8,9,26,28, ...7d, which is also a sidereal value, very close to that embedded in
 al-Muqtabis (0;59,8,9,21,15,...7d).

 In the Tables of Barcelona, we are given values for the epoch, beginning in 1321

 (1 Is 5;48°), as well as for each day in a month in a year, for successive years and
 accumulations of them (Millâs 1962, pp. 162-189, and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 482^486).
 The value deduced from the entry for 600 years (lis 9;45°) is 0;59,8,9,10,13,... °/d,

 also in the tradition of al-Muqtabis.

 In MS W 20a-20[bis]b, Ibn Waqàr lists the radices of Ibn al-Kammâd's lost zTj
 al-Kawr for the beginning of each year from 720 A.H. to 839 A.H. The entries in this

 table give the value of the mean longitude of the celestial bodies on the last day of

 that year. The entry for the Sun for 720 A.H. is 10s 5;29,5° and that for 780 A.H., 0s

 21;29,33°. The resulting daily mean motion is 0;59,8,11,26,4,...°/d, a value which is

 very close to that in al-Muqtabis, and agrees with the value, 0;59,8,11,20,56, ...°/d,

 we deduce from the excess of revolution given by Ibn Waqâr in MS W 57b (cf. Castells

 1991, pp. 45 and 48).

 5.2 Solar apogee

 ·£) Springer

 The solar apogee has a proper motion, and its daily mean motion derived from the
 tabulated value for 720 A.H. (see Table 16) is 0;0,0,2,2,14,46,...7d. This is equivalent

 to a motion of 1° in about 299 Arabic years or in about 290 Julian years, a value which

 603

 differs from the daily motion of the apogee used by Azarquiel (0;0,0,2,7,10,39,...°/d),

 corresponding to a motion of 1° in about 279 Julian years.

 If we combine the value for the radix of the solar center (Is 6;35,9°) with the radix

 for the solar apogee (2s 16;45,21°: see above), we obtain the longitude of the Sun

 at epoch (i.e., the Hijra), 3s 23;20,30°. This value is close to, but not identical with,

 those given by Azarquiel and al-Khwârizml (see Toomer 1968, p. 44).

 The recomputations show that Ibn al-Kammâd used Azarquiel's value for the mean

 motion of the Sun, but that he incorporated a different parameter for the mean motion

 of the apogee which does not appear in any extant text prior to this one.

 The proper motion of the solar apogee in the Tables of Barcelona is given as a

 column in a table also containing the mean motion of the first point of Aries and

 precession (Millâs 1962, p. 190, and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 486-487). The radix is 0;0,0°,

 and the entry for 300 years is 1;2,15° in MS Vat. Heb. 356; however, it is erroneously

 given in MS Ripoll 21 (and in Millâs's edition) as 1;0,15°. From the former entry, we

 compute a value of 0;0,0,2,2,42,38,... °/d, very close to that in al-Muqtabis.

 Neither Juan Gil nor Ibn Waqâr has a table for the motion of the solar apogee.

 5.3 Moon

 MS M 29r-v; MS F 33v-34r

 The tables for the lunar mean motions give entries for its center, anomaly, and dou

 ble elongation. The daily mean motion of the Moon in longitude resulting from the

 tabulated value for 720 A.H. (see Table 16) is 13;10,34,52,46,.. .°/d. This is exactly

 al-Khwârizmï's value (cf. Neugebauer 1962a, pp. 42, 92), and very nearly that in the

 Toledan Tables (cf. Toomer 1968, pp. 44,48; Pedersen 2002, pp. 1149-1156). For the

 daily mean motion in anomaly, the result is 13;3,53,56,19,.. ,°/d, which is very close

 to the corresponding value in the zij of al-Battànï (Nallino 1903-1907, 2:20), and in

 the Toledan Tables (Toomer 1968, pp. 44,49; Pedersen 2002, pp. 1156-1160). In the
 case of double elongation, we compute a daily mean motion of 24;22,53,26,50,.. ,7d.

 The Almanac of 1307 has tables for the daily mean motion of the Moon in longitude

 and anomaly for a period of one year, as well as a table for the lunar node at intervals

 of 3 days for a period of one year (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 3349, ff. 20r,

 22r, and 24r; and MS 17961, ff. 59v, 61v, and 63r). The mean motions underlying

 these tables are 13;10,34,52,47°/d, 13;3,53,56,4°/d, and 0;3,10,46,24°/d, respectively.
 These values agree, to sexagesimal thirds, with those embedded in al-Muqtabis (see
 Table 16).

 In his tables for the lunar mean motions (MS G 79b-8 la), Juan Gil uses cycles of 152

 years for the lunar center, as was the case in his table for the solar mean motion, cycles

 of 116 years for lunar anomaly, and cycles of 76 years for the double elongation.

 The daily mean motions we deduce from the tables for these three quantities are

 13;10,34,56,55,.. .°/d, 13;3,53,47,53,.. .°/d, and 24;22,53,14,42,.. ,°/d, respectively;

 we note that these values differ somewhat from those in al-Muqtabis.

 The recomputed parameters for these three quantities from the Tables of Barcelona

 are, respectively, 13;10,35,1,23,...°/d, 13;3,53,54,51, ...°/d, and 24;22,53,24,26,

 5.4 Planets

 MS M 30r-34v; MS F 34v-39r

 For Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, the tables (arranged for the radix, collected

 years in units of 30 Arabic years, single Arabic years, months, days, and hours) give

 entries for the mean motion for both the center and the anomaly. For Venus, the entries

 display the mean motion in anomaly only (Venus's mean motion of center is that

 of the Sun), and for the lunar node, the entries are the complement in 360° of the

 mean motion of the ascending node in longitude, to avoid subtractions. All parameters

 computed from the tabulated entries for the mean motions show close, although not
 perfect, agreement with those derived from the Toledan Tables (see Table 16); the

 differences are never greater than 0;0,0,1°. The values for the radices are for the Hijra

 and, again, they differ from those in the zij of al-Khwàrizmï and those in the Toledan
 Tables.

 The sum of the radix for Mercury's center, 9s 4;58°, and the value for Mercury's

 apogee, 6s 18;21,30° (as in MS F), is 3s 23;19,30°, which is very close to the position

 of the Sun at epoch according to this zij, 3s 23;20,30°. The entries for the mean motions

 of center were computed by adding the entry for 720 Arabic years to the appropriate

 number of complete rotations, subtracting the radix from it and dividing the result by

 720y χ 354;22d, where an Arabic year is 354;22d. For example, for Saturn

 0;2,0,24,24, ...°/d = (130;30 + 24 χ 360 - 236;52)/(720 χ 354;22).

 The sum of the daily mean motions of center and anomaly for each of the outer
 planets should equal the daily mean solar motion, 0;59,8,9,21,15,.. .°/d. For Saturn,

 the mean daily motion of center is 0;2,0,24,24,...°/d and the mean daily motion in
 anomaly is 0;57,7,44,57,...°/d. Hence, the sum for Saturn is 0;59,8,9,21,...°/d which
 is the value for the Sun.

 In the Almanac of 1307, there are tables for the daily mean motion of the planets

 in longitude (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 3349, ff. 54r, and MS 17961, ff. 61r,

 90v). The entries for one day are 0;2,0,24,26°/d (Saturn), 0;4,59,5,32°/d (Jupiter),

 0;31,26,28,46°/d (Mars), and 0;59,8,9,21°/d (Venus, Mercury, and Sun), all of which

 agree nicely with those embedded in al-Muqtabis (see Table 16).

 The daily mean motions of the planets derived from the Tables of Barcelona differ

 from those in al-Muqtabis displayed in Table 16, in the thirds when referring to plan

 etary longitudes, and in the fourths in the case of planetary anomalies (see Chabâs

 1996a, p. 486). All values for the planets derived from the zij of Ibn Waqâr are also

 close to those used in Ibn al-Kammàd's zij. However, in the zij of Ibn Waqâr "epoch

 values according to the [lost] zij al-Kawr [by Ibn al- Kammàd]" are given for the mean

 longitudes of each outer planet (as well as for the Sun and the Moon) for the end of

 each year from 720 A.H. to 839 A.H. together with the mean anomalies for Venus,

 Mercury, and the Moon at these times, that is, there is no table for radices and motions

 in collected years in this zij (see MS W 20a-20[bis]b). For some values in this table
 for the solar mean motion, see Sect.5.1, above.

 6 Equations

 6.1 Sun

 MS M 35r; MS F 39v

 The entries in this table correspond to the solar equation in degrees, minutes, and

 seconds as a function of mean argument of center, which is given at l°-intervals. The

 maximum value of the solar equation, which occurs at 92°, is 1;52,44°, thus differing
 from the more common values: 1;59° (Habash al-Hâsib, Yahyâ ibn Abl Mansûr),
 1;59,10° (Toledan Tables, al-Battànï), 2; 14° (al-Khwârizmï), 2;23° (Ptolemy). It is

 therefore likely that Ibn al-Kammâd accepted a parameter from Azarquiel. In both

 manuscripts, the heading gives the position of the solar apogee 2s 16;45,21°, for the

 Hijra. For an edition and recomputation of this table, see Chabâs and Goldstein (1994),

 pp. 4-10, reprinted in Chabâs and Goldstein (2015), pp. 182-190.

 The Almanac of 1307 does not display a table for the solar equation, but its maxi

 mum value can be estimated from the 4-year table for the daily true solar positions for
 the period 1307-1310 (Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 3349, ff 16r-19v, and MS

 17691, ff. 55v-59r). We note that this table displays sidereal coordinates, for the entry

 of the Sun in Aries occurs on March 23. To estimate the maximum solar equation,
 we use the table for 1308, which has fewer scribal errors than that for 1307 (in the

 manuscripts cited above, the entries for March-August 1307 were in fact mistakenly

 copied from those for the same period in 1309). The passage of the Sun through its

 apogee takes place around mid-June; at that time, the solar equation is zero and the true

 longitude of the Sun equals the longitude of the solar apogee. Since we are told that

 the solar apogee at the beginning of 1307 is Gem 19; 6° (see Sect. 4.2) and, given its
 proper motion of 0;0,0,2,2,14,46°/d (see Sect. 5.2), the longitude of the solar apogee

 in mid-June 1308 should be 79;6,16°. In that year, the Sun reached it apogee between
 noon June 13 and noon June 14, when the true solar positions were 78;45,19° and

 79;42,15°, respectively. Thus, the passage through apogee should have occurred at

 about 8;50h after noon on June 13. Now, in the two symmetric dates about 93 days

 before and after that time, the positions of the Sun are such that the solar equation is

 very close to its extremal values. The nearest dates in the table are March 12 (entry:

 348;59,27°) and September 15 (entry: 169;31,22°). If we consider a daily mean solar

 motion of 0;59,8,9°/d (see Sect. 5.1), in 93d 8;50h (March 12, noon, to June 13,8;50h),

 the Sun has progressed 92;0,34° (this is its mean center), whereas its true center is

 79;6,16°-348;59,27° = 90;6,49°. The solar equation is the difference between the

 mean and the true centers of the Sun: 92;0,34° - 90;6,49° = 1;53,45°. Similarly
 for the other symmetrical point where the solar equation should reach its minimum,

 the Sun has progressed 92; 17,49° between its passage through apogee and September
 15, noon. The true center is 169;31,22° - 79;6,16° = 90;25,6°, and the solar equa
 tion is thus 90;25,6° - 92; 17,49° = -1;52,43°. The values obtained for the solar

 equation, when close to its maximum and minimum, agree very well, although not

 perfectly, with that used by Ibn al-Kammâd in al-Muqtabis, 1;52,44°, indicating that,

 with respect to the Sun, the Almanac of 1307 depended on Ibn al-Kammâd.

 In Juan Gil's table for the solar equation (MS G 79a), the argument is given at

 intervals of 0; 30° and the entries are in degrees and minutes; the maximum value is
 1;52°, truncated from Ibn al-Kammâd's maximum of 1;52,44°.

 The solar equation in the Tables of Barcelona is also based on a maximum of 1 ; 52°,

 where the entries are only given to minutes, but the presentation is quite different from

 that in MSS M and F and that of Juan Gil, for the argument of the table is the mean solar

 longitude (rather than the mean argument of center), and thus, the entries correspond

 to the true solar longitude. The solar equation is obtained by subtracting the entry from

 the corresponding argument (Millâs 1962, pp. 192-193; Chabâs 1996a, pp. 489—494).

 In other words, let y = e(k) be the function for the solar equation, e, where the mean

 center, k, serves as the variable listed in the table in al-Muqtabis, and e(k) is negative

 for 0° < k < 180°. Then, the corresponding function in the Tables of Barcelona is

 λ = e(k) + k + Λα = e(k) + λ,

 where λ is the true longitude of the Sun, λ its mean longitude, and the longitude of

 the solar apogee, here taken as 19°. Note that k = λ-λ^. By using mean longitude as

 the argument, a value for the solar apogee has been assumed: it occurs where the entry

 is equal to the argument, i.e., where the difference between the mean longitude and the

 true longitude is zero. This occurs between longitudes 2s 19° (the corresponding entry

 is 2s 19; 1°) and 2s 20° (the corresponding entry is 2s 19;59°), and this is consistent

 with the solar apogee in the heading in the Tables of Barcelona, 2s 19;25,55°.

 A similar table is found in the zij of Ibn Waqâr (MS W 36b). No value for the apogee

 is mentioned in the heading in MS W, but it can easily be determined from the table,

 where the equation for 2s 19° is exactly 0°; hence, this is Ibn Waqàr's solar apogee,

 and it is very close to the value in the Tables of Barcelona. In Ibn Waqâr's table for

 the solar equation, the maximum value is 1;53° for arguments 5s 18° to 5s 23°; that

 is, Ibn Waqâr rounded Ibn al-Kammâd's maximum of 1;52,44° to the nearest minute
 in contrast to the Tables of Barcelona and the zij of Juan Gil where Ibn al-Kammâd's
 value was truncated.

 The table for the solar equation in the zij of Judah ben Verga displays entries to
 minutes. The maximum is 1;53°, a value rounded from Ibn al-Kammâd's, 1;52,44°.

 The solar equation in the zij of Abu 1-Hasan CA1I al-Qusantïnï is in the Sindhind

 tradition rather than the Ptolemaic tradition: the maximum equation is 2; 14°, as in

 the zij of al-Khwârizml (Kennedy and King 1982, p. 11; cf. Suter 1914, p. 134). The

 entries in this table were computed by the "method of declinations" that probably

 came from Sasanian Iran (Kennedy and King 1982, p. 11):

 e(k) - emax x S(k)/s,

 where e{k) is the solar equation of the mean center k, emax is the maximum solar

 equation of 2; 14°, 8(k) is the declination of k, and ε is the obliquity of the ecliptic

 (cf. Neugebauer 1962a, p. 95).

 6.2 Moon

 MS M 36r-37r; MS F 40v-41v

 The five columns in this table display the argument, the equation of center, an inter

 polation function, the increment (a quantity introduced by Ptolemy corresponding to

 the difference between the equation of anomaly at quadrature (when the elongation

 is 90°) and the equation of anomaly at syzygy (when the elongation is either 0° or

 180°), and the equation of anomaly. The Latin terms used in MS M for these four

 quantities, remotio centri, minuta partis remotionis, remotio linee, and directio centri,

 respectively, differ from the standard Latin terminology (see, e.g., the Toledan Tables:

 Toomer 1968, pp. 58-59; Pedersen 2002, pp. 1250-1258). As shown in Table 18, the

 equation of center reaches a maximum of 13; 9° at 114°, and the equation of anomaly
 a maximum of 5; 1,0° at 95°. These are values found in the zij of al-Battànï and the

 Toledan Tables, but we note there is no column here for the lunar latitude, in contrast

 to what is found in these two sets of tables. The entries for the equation of anomaly

 agree with those in al-Battânï's zij, but differ slightly from those in the Toledan Tables,
 where the maximum is 5;0,59° at 94°-95°.

 The same table is found in the Almagest V.8, in the Handy Tables, and in many

 medieval sets of tables, such as the zij of Yahyâ ibn Abï Mansûr (Salam and Kennedy

 1967, pp. 495-496), the zij of al-Battânî (Nallino 1903-1907,2:78-83) and the Toledan
 Tables (Toomer 1968, pp. 58-59; Pedersen 2002, pp. 1250-1258).

 The table for the lunar equations by Juan Gil (MS G 86b-89a) has the same entries

 except for the fact that, as was the case for the solar equation, the entries are given at
 intervals of 0;30°.

 In the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, pp. 191, 196-197, and Chabâs 1996a,

 p. 495), the lunar equations are presented in two tables. One contains the quantities

 depending on the double elongation (equation of center and minutes of proportion), and

 the other those depending on the lunar anomaly (increment and equation of anomaly).

 It is noteworthy that in the table for the equation of center and the minutes of proportion,

 the two columns were transcribed erroneously (only the entries for even values of the

 argument were copied), so that the maximum, 13;9°, occurs at 57° (not at 114°: Table

 18). Nevertheless, but for copyist's errors, all entries seem to derive from al-Muqtabis.

 In his zij, Ibn Waqâr also presents the lunar equations in two tables, one for quantities

 depending on the double elongation and another for those depending on the lunar

 anomaly. The entries in the first table agree with those in Almagest V.8. The second

 table is for the equation of anomaly (with a maximum of 5; 1°) and the quantity called

 "increment" (with a maximum of 2;40°), and the entries also derive from Almagest

 V.8. Instead of presenting these two quantities in two columns (see Table 18), for each

 zodiacal sign from 0 to 5 we are here given a matrix of 30 rows (one for each integer

 degree of the lunar anomaly) and 7 columns (for values 0,10,20,..., 60 of the minutes

 of proportion), and the entries in it, in minutes, are the sum of the equation of anomaly

 and the corresponding increment depending on the proportion. Thus, the column for

 0 min of proportion displays the equation of anomaly as in Table 18, and from the

 column for 60 min of proportion one can derive, by subtraction, the full "increment"

 listed in standard tables. This format is unparalleled in any other zij.

 The table for the lunar equation in the Almanac of 1307 differs from that in al

 Muqtabis, for it only has one equation (for anomaly), with a maximum of 4;56°,

 and no equation of center. This table is characteristic of the Sindhind tradition, and its

 entries were computed by the "method of declinations" (described in Sect. 6.1, above).

 It is found in the zijes of al-Khwârizmï (cf. Suter 1914, p. 134, and Neugebauer 1962a,

 p. 96; Kennedy and King 1982, p. 11), Ibn Mucàdh (Samsô [1992] 2011, p. 157), Ibn

 Ishâq (Mercier 1996, p. 415), Abu 1-Hasan cAlï al-Qusantïnl, and in the Latin world

 in the tables of John Vimond (Chabâs and Goldstein 2004, p. 225), and the Parisian

 Alfonsine Tables, among others (Chabâs and Goldstein 2012, p. 72).

 In the tables of Ibn al-Kammàd, the maximum solar equation (1;52,44°) differs
 from the maximum equation of center for Venus (1;59°; see Table 19). This value for

 Venus is not that of the Almagest, but follows al-Battânï and the Toledan Tables.

 Except for the equation of center for Venus, the tables for the planetary equa

 tions are essentially those found in Almagest XI. 11 and in the Handy Tables. The

 columns are displayed in the same way as in the zij of al-Battânî (Nallino 1903—
 1907, 2:8-137) and the Toledan Tables (Toomer 1968, pp. 60-68; Pedersen 2002,
 pp. 1259-1306), among many others. All we can deduce from these tables is that Ibn

 al-Kammâd accepted the Ptolemaic tradition, as displayed in al-Battànï's zij, followed
 by most Muslim astronomers, and that Ibn al-Kammâd's contribution was restricted

 to solar theory, without introducing any changes in planetary theory (see Table 20).

 As mentioned above, the apogees are listed in the heading of the tables for the plan

 ences, to be applied to the minutes of proportion near apogee or perigee, respectively,

 when computing the equation of anomaly. In the computation of the longitude of a

 planet, one has to take into account the position of its apogee, which is the sum of its

 value at the epoch and the motion of the solar apogee in the time interval since the
 epoch.

 etary equations and, in MS F, although not in MS M, we are also given the planetary
 nodes.

 The planetary equations in the zij of Abu 1-Hasan cAlï al-Qusantlnï are in the
 Sindhind tradition rather than the Ptolemaic tradition. In fact, while these tables for

 the planetary equations are not otherwise found in extant Arabic zijes, they agree
 essentially with those in the Latin version of al-Khwàrizmî's zij (Kennedy and King

 1982, pp. 4, 11).

 The parameters in the model for Venus in the Middle Ages were often borrowed

 from those for the Sun, notably the apogee and the eccentricity (or, equivalently, their

 maximum equations of center). In the Almagest the solar apogee is 65 ; 30° whereas the

 apogee for Venus is 55° in Ptolemy's own time (Almagest III.4 and X.2; Toomer 1984,

 pp. 155 and 470). In other words, Ptolemy does not link these parameters for Venus

 with those for the Sun. Nevertheless, it was common practice in the Middle Ages to

 set the apogees of the Sun and Venus at the same longitude such that when the apogee

 of the Sun was changed for any reason, the apogee for Venus was changed as well, to

 maintain agreement. Similarly, when the maximum equation of center for the Sun was

 changed for any reason, the maximum equation of center for Venus was changed as

 well, generally without any explanation. For example, in the zij of al-Battànï the solar
 apogee is 82; 15° (or 82; 14°) and the maximum solar equation is 1;59,10° (Nallino
 1903-1907, 1:72 and 2:81), while the apogee of Venus is equal to that of the Sun and

 the maximum equation of center for Venus is 1;59° (Nallino 1903-1907, 1:114 and

 2:129). Although al-Battânï offers no explanation, al-Bïrûnï (d. 1048) gives us the

 historical background:

 Venus's equation with reference to the center of its equant sphere is equal, accord

 ing to Ptolemy, to the solar equation, and it was in the Ztj al-Shâh that the

 corrected solar [longitude] is the corrected argument of Venus. This is impos

 sible unless their apogees and equations are equal, and this is how they are in

 [the Zîj al-Shâh]. This opinion was transferred by [Habash] to the principles of

 Ptolemy, so he set the apogee of Venus which is [also] the apogee of the Sun

 according to the moderns, and its equation for the argument, equal to those of
 the Sun.

 Thus, according to al-Bïrûnï, the decision to make the parameters of Venus equal

 to those of the Sun was taken by Habash al-Hâsib (ninth century), and he depended

 on the Zîj al-Shâh, composed in Persia ca. 450 and revised in the sixth and seventh

 centuries, which has models that belong to an Indian tradition and are non-Ptolemaic
 (Goldstein and Sawyer 1977, pp. 167-168).

 In al-Muqtabis, the apogee of Venus (76;45,21°) is the same as that of the Sun, but

 the maximum equations are different, for Ibn al-Kâmmad left the maximum equation

 of center for Venus at 1;59° as in al-Battànî, while adopting a more recent value

 (1;52,44°) for the maximum solar equation of center. The same approach is found

 in Ibn al-Raqqâm's Mustawfi zij, where the maximum of center for Venus is 1;51°,

 whereas that of the Sun is 1;49,7° (Samsô 2014, p. 318).

 As was the case for the Sun and the Moon, in the tables for the planetary equations

 in the zij of Juan Gil (MS G 123b-138a) the argument is given at intervals of 0;30°.

 There are no significant discrepancies between the entries in these tables in the zij of

 Juan Gil and those in the zij of Ibn al-Kammâd.

 In the Tables of Barcelona, as was the case for the lunar equations, for each planet

 there are two tables: one to determine its position on the deferent and the other for

 its position on the epicycle (Millâs 1962, pp. 200-219, and Chabâs 1996a, pp. 496
 499). All parameters are the same as those used by Ibn al-Kammâd, but for minor

 differences. In the first table, the argument is no longer the mean center, but the mean

 longitude, which results after adding to the mean center the value for the longitude

 of the apogee (see Table 15). The two columns represent the equation of center and

 the minutes of proportion. In the second table, we are given the equation of anomaly

 and two corrections to adjust the equation depending on the distance of the planet to
 apogee or perigee (last three columns in Table 19).

 The tables for the planetary equations by Ibn Waqâr (MS W 39a-50a) take the

 same approach as the Tables of Barcelona but, as was already the case for the solar

 and lunar equations, they introduce new elements and some variants. In the first table

 for each planet, the entries for the equation of center are similar to those in the Tables of

 Barcelona with the same maximum values; however, the apogees have been rounded

 and, as a result, the entries are slightly different from those in the Tables of Barcelona.

 For example, the apogee of Saturn in the Tables of Barcelona is 8s 1;23°, whereas in

 MS W it is exactly 8s 1°. As in the Tables of Barcelona, in MS W there are also entries

 in the first table for the minutes of proportion (here called minutes of the equation),

 but they vary from 0 to 120 rather than 0 and 60. The reason is to avoid subtraction, for

 the values in the Tables of Barcelona are sometimes positive and sometimes negative;
 as a rule, the entries in MS W are 60 greater than those in the Tables of Barcelona,

 taking into account the negative values there. In the standard tables for the planetary

 equations, one enters with the mean center to find the minutes of proportion, but in

 MS W, instead of the mean center, one enters the first table with the mean longitude

 to find the minutes of proportion. In the second table for each planet, the equation of
 anomaly is presented in two or more columns, one for minimum values and another

 for maximum values (headed 0 and 120, respectively), instead of three columns as

 in the Tables of Barcelona, with a mean value for the equation of anomaly and two

 corrections, one additive and another subtractive. Since only a few values of the minutes

 of proportion are represented in the headings of the columns, interpolation is necessary

 for intermediate values. The entries in the two columns labeled 0 and 120 are clearly

 related to those in the Tables of Barcelona and yield the same values for the equation of

 anomaly. For Saturn and Jupiter, there are just the columns for 0 and 120 (representing

 the minimum and maximum equations of anomaly for a given value of the corrected

 anomaly), whereas for Mars there are columns at intervals of 12 minutes from 0 to 120

 (to reduce the need for interpolation between values that are far apart); similarly, for

 Venus there are columns at intervals of 40 minutes from 0 to 120, and for Mercury at

 intervals of 24 min from 0 to 120. To interpolate for intermediate values of the minutes

 of proportion, that is, between the values in the headings of the columns, there is a set

 of interpolation tables to be applied to the preceding tables for the equation of anomaly

 (MS W 50b-51a). Although the presentation is new, the underlying parameters have

 not changed.

 6.4 Nodes

 MS F displays longitudes of the planetary nodes in the headings for the planetary
 equations (see Table 21); they are not found in MS M: see MS F 42r (Saturn), 44r

 (Jupiter), 45r (Mars), 47r (Venus), 48r (Mercury).

 The values for the planetary nodes derive from Indian sources, and they are found

 in al-Khwârizmï's zij: Saturn 3s 13; 12°, Jupiter 2s 22; 1°, Mars 0s 21;54°, Venus Is

 29;27°, and Mercury 0s 21; 10° (Suter 1914, pp. 15,64-65; Neugebauer 1962a, p. 42:

 the only variant in MS F is for Saturn). The values in al-Khwàrizmfs zij also appear

 in the Toledan Tables (Toomer 1968, p. 45). Al-Bïrûnï reports that these values for

 the planetary nodes depend on an Indian tradition (Wright (ed. and trans.) 1934, p.

 105; cf. Pingree 1978, p. 568). Using the rules in Indian astronomy for determining

 the positions of the planetary nodes, Pingree (1968b, p. 100) computed the following

 values for June 16, 632, the epoch of era Yazdegird, which was used in the original

 (lost) version of al-Khwârizmï's zij (Neugebauer 1962a, p. 83; van Dalen 1996, p. 198):

 Saturn 3s 13; 12°, Jupiter 2s 22; 1°, Mars 0s 21;54°, Venus Is 29;47°, and Mercury

 0s 21 ; 110. The only variant is for Mercury where the computed value differs from the

 values in the medieval texts by 1 min.

 These values, computed for June 16,632, were applied by Maslama in his version of

 al-Khwârizmï's zij, where the epoch is the Hijra, July 15, 622 (about 10 years earlier).

 There is no table for the motion of the planetary nodes for, as Ibn al-Muthannâ tells

 us in his commentary on al-Khwârizmï's zij, "the nodes of a planet deviate from their

 positions by only a small amount which is barely perceptible even after many years"
 (Goldstein 1967a, pp. 27, 153). In spite of this, some manuscripts give values which
 are labeled, "the 'mean motions' of the planetary nodes," but they are not real mean

 motions, for they are equal to the complements in 360° of the respective longitudes

 of the nodes (e.g., Vatican, MS Ottob. 1826, f. 38v).

 The Almanac of 1307 has also a table for the planetary nodes (Madrid, Biblioteca

 Nacional, MS 3349, f. 54r, and MS 17961, ff. 61r and 90v):

 Saturn Cnc 13;13° = 103;13°
 Jupiter Gem 12; 2°= 72; 2° (al-Khwariziru: 2s 22;1° = 82;1°)
 Mars Ari 21;55°= 21;55°
 Venus Tau 29;40° = 59;40° (al-Khwàrizmï: Is 29;27° = 59;27°)
 Mercury Ari 21;12°= 21;12°

 Yet, in another Latin copy of the Almanac of 1307 (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale

 de France, MS 7403, f. 28v), the nodes for Jupiter and Venus are given as Gem 22;2°

 and Tau 29; 49°, respectively, whereas the three others agree with the entries in the

 other two manuscripts. The reading for Jupiter in this copy is to be preferred, for it

 agrees closely with the value in al-Khwàrizmï. In sum, this almanac has essentially the

 values for the planetary nodes found in the zij of al-Khwârizmï and in al-Muqtabis,

 except in the case of Venus, where some error in transmission (affecting the minutes)

 may have happened. There is also an increase in one or two minutes, for which we

 have no explanation.

 Among the tables in MS M that do not belong to al-Muqtabis, there is one with the

 title, "Capita draconum planetarum in anno quingentesimo et quinquagesimo ab annis

 seductionis" (f. 66r). The year 550 A.H corresponds to 1155-56 A.D. Unfortunately,

 the table has no headings and only half of its entries are displayed (see Table 22),

 making it impossible to draw any conclusions.

 MS M 51v; MS F 57v-58r

 Except for copying errors, the entries in both manuscripts agree with those in al

 KhwârizmFs table (Suter 1914, pp. 175-180). The entries are given at intervals of 1°,
 and the extremal values are as follows:

 vs(l°) = 0;2,22°/h, and vs(180°) = 0;2,34°/h (with MS F; MS M: 0;2,24°/h),

 vm(l°) = 0;30,12°/h, andvm(180°) = 0;35,40°/h.

 For an edition and a recomputation of the table for lunar velocity, see Chabâs and

 Goldstein (1994), pp. 10-13, reprinted in Chabâs and Goldstein (2015), pp. 190-194.

 Table 23 displays entries of the hourly solar velocity.

 The same two tables are also found in the tables of Juan Gil (MS G 91a) and the

 8 Latitude

 8.1 Moon

 MS M 35v and 53r ("Tabula latitudinis lune iudicate"); MS F 40r and 60r ('Table of

 adjusted [meduyyaq] lunar latitude")

 There are two tables for the lunar latitude in al-Muqtabis, which exemplify the two

 astronomical traditions that coexisted in the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages.

 Both tables give the lunar latitude, β, as a function of the argument of lunar latitude,

 ω; in both, the argument is given at intervals of 1°, and the entries are given in degrees

 and minutes. One table has a maximum of 5;0°, which is the value used by Ptolemy,

 al-Battànï, Azarquiel, among many others, and is the standard table in medieval astron

 omy. The entries in this table can be recomputed by means of the modern formula

 β = arcsin (sin i χ sin ω),

 where i is the inclination of the lunar orb to the ecliptic, taken here as 5;0°.

 The other table (see Table 24) is based on a maximum of 4; 29°, and the latitude

 displayed is frequently called "adjusted," "precise," or "equated." This table is also
 found, with minor variants, in al-Khwârizmï's zij (Suter 1914, pp. 132-134, column

 6; cf. Neugebauer 1962a, pp. 95-98), where the maximum value is 4; 30°. A similar

 table, with the same maximum value, appears in the zij of Yahyà ibn Abl Mansur

 (Kennedy 1956a, p. 146). In our opinion, the fact that al-Muqtabis reads 4; 29° instead

 of 4; 30° does not suggest a different parameter; rather, it should be interpreted as a

 the entries in this table were computed according to the "method of sines" by means

 1934, p. 32; cf. Neugebauer 1962a, p. 98) and, together with other tables related to

 the theory of eclipses in the Muqtabis zij, it had a considerable impact on subsequent

 astronomers. Indeed, this table for adjusted lunar latitude is found in several other sets
 of tables compiled in the Iberian Peninsula.

 The same table, with a maximum of 4;29°, is found in the Tables of Barcelona,

 where the Catalan term "endressade" (fixed, corrected) in Ripoll, MS 21, and the
 Hebrew term metuqqan (corrected)—both in the canons and the table in Vatican, MS

 Heb. 356, f. 62a—are used to refer to the lunar latitude (Millâs 1962, p. 234; Chabâs
 1996a, p. 504). We note that the Tables of Barcelona display another table with a

 maximum latitude of 5;0°, as is also the case in al-Muqtabis. In contrast, the zijes of
 Juan Gil (MS G 89b) and Ibn Waqâr (MS W 55a) only have tables for lunar latitudes
 with a maximum of 5;0,0°.

 A table for eclipses in al-Muqtabis is also extant in Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414,

 headed 'Tabula latitudinis lune verificate," with a maximum of 4;29° (f. 143r). Three

 of its entries differ from those in the corresponding table by Ibn al-Kammâd. Of these,

 two agree with the entries in the zij of al-Khwârizmï.

 The value of 4; 30° for the maximum lunar latitude was also used by Abu 1-Hasan

 cAlï al-Qusantïnl (Kennedy and King 1982, p. 21) as well as by Levi ben Gerson. In
 the latter case, it is independent of the Indian tradition, for it is based on Levi's own

 observations (Goldstein 1974, pp. 132-134 and 212-217). Various authors followed

 Levi in this respect, including Jacob ben David Bonjorn and Abraham Zacut. It is

 worth noting that Zacut's Almanach Perpetuum has two tables for lunar latitude, one

 each for maximum entries of 4;29° and 5;0°, in the tradition of al-Muqtabis. Both

 tables are also found in the Tabule Verificate for Salamanca with epoch January 1,
 1461 (Chabâs and Goldstein 2000, p. 32 and 130-131).

 8.2 Planets

 MS M 45r-v; MS F 67v-68r

 The table for the latitude of the planets is presented as two sub-tables, one for Saturn,

 Jupiter, and Mars, and one for Venus and Mercury. The one for the latitude of the

 superior planets (see Table 25) is the same, but for scribal errors, as that in the Almagest

 ΧΙΠ.5 and in al-Battànï (Nallino 1903-1907,2:140 (columns 1-3) and p. 141 (column

 4)). The structure of this table differs greatly from the corresponding one in the Handy

 Tables, and in the zij of al-Khwârizmï. Toomer listed some MSS associated with the

 Toledan Tables that contain such a table, but concluded that it is not part of the original

 Toledan Tables (Toomer 1968, pp. 71-72).

 In contrast to the superior planets, the latitude table for the inferior planets (see

 Table 26) does not conform to the pattern of the Almagest, the zij of al-Battànï, the zij
 of al-Khwârizmï, or the tables associated with the Toledan Tables. Rather, this table

 reproduces, with variant readings, the entries which are multiples of 6° in the Handy

 Tables (Stahlman 1959, pp. 331-334, where the entries are given at 3°-intervals). In

 particular, the maximum values for the mean latitude of Mercury (3;52°) agrees in
 both sets of tables, but those for the mean latitude of Venus differ (8; 35° in MS M

 and 8;51° in the Handy Tables). However, chapter 16 (f. lOva) of the canons to al

 Muqtabis gives 4; 18° and 8; 36° as the values for the maximum latitude of Mercury

 and Venus. Kennedy (1956a, p. 173) reports maximum values for Mercury (4; 18°)

 and Venus (8;56°) and associates the Mumtahan zij and Ibn Hibintâ with them.

 Nevertheless, the outstanding feature here is the juxtaposition of different Ptolemaic

 tabular material: the Almagest for the superior planets, and the Handy Tables for the

 inferior planets. The source for such a mixed approach has not been determined.

 We note that in the tables for planetary latitudes associated with al-Muqtabis no

 values are given for the longitudes of the planetary nodes, although MS M 66r has a
 list of them.

 In addition, MS F 49v-54r has another table for planetary latitudes, corresponding
 to the one in al-Khwàrizmï's zij (Suter 1914, pp. 139-167, columns 7-8). In the
 headings of the sub-tables for each planet, we find values for the ascending nodes:
 8s 16; 15° (Saturn), 9s 7;59° (Jupiter), lis 8;6° (Mars), 10s 0;33° (Venus), and lis
 8; 50° (Mercury). These nodes differ from those displayed in Table 21 and, as far as

 we can determine, they do not occur in any other source.

 9 Stations

 MS M 46r; MS F 54v

 For each planet, we are only given four values: the positions of the first and the second

 stationary points for arguments of 0° and 180° (see Table 27).

 The tabulated values for the same argument add up correctly to 360°. In all cases,

 they agree with those found in the Toledan Tables (Toomer 1968, pp. 60-68; Pedersen

 2002, pp. 1265-1305), and the zij of al-Khwàrizmï (Suter 1914, pp. 138-167, tables

 27-56), both zijes displaying tables for each integer degree of the argument. Nearly,

 the same values are also found in the zij of al-Battânï (Nallino 1903-1907, 2:138
 139), which is of Ptolemaic origin. However, Almagest XII.8 and the Handy Tables

 (Stahlman 1959, pp. 335-339) have slightly different tables for the stations: in the

 latter, the argument was modified, as well as the interval for the calculation of the

 entries (6° in the Almagest, 3° in the Handy Tables): cf. Neugebauer 1975, pp. 202
 206, 1005-1006.

 The same table is found in Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh State Library, MS 298, where

 it is attributed to Ibn al-Kammàd in his lost zij al-Kawr calâ l-dawr (Mestres 1996,

 p. 422, and Mestres 1999, p. 53).

 The tables for the planetary stations in Juan Gil's zij are on MS G 139a with the

 heading: Table for the stations, retrograde and direct, for the five planets on their

 epicycles. The entries are at 6°-intervals in two columns: from 0s 6° to 3s 0° in the

 first column and their complements in 6s 0° in the second column. In the case of

 Saturn, the first entries for first and second stations, respectively, are: 3s 22; 43° for 0s

 6°, and 8s 7;17° for lis 24° (Almagest XII.8: 112;45° and 247;15°). But for Jupiter,

 the entries in MS G agree with those in the Almagest.

 Ibn Waqàr has a short table for the planetary stations (MS W 35b): there are only
 two values for each planet, and they agree with those in al-Muqtabis for first and
 second stations at apogee except for Mercury where MS W has 4s 24; 42° and 7s

 5; 18°, respectively. In addition, there are lengthy tables for the planetary stations (MS

 W 84a-87b) that differ from those in any other set of tables known to us, but the values

 reported in their respective headings are those listed in al-Muqtabis.

 MS M 58v has a completely different table for rétrogradation (see Sect. 16.8).

 Parallax is defined as the difference between the zenith distance of a celestial object as

 seen by an observer on Earth and the zenith distance that would be observed from the

 center of the Earth: see Fig. 2. The maximum value of parallax takes place at the local

 horizon, and it is called "horizontal parallax." In general, one seeks the components of

 parallax in celestial longitude and latitude in order to correct the position of a celestial

 body at a given time for an observer at a given location. In the Middle Ages, parallax

 was ignored for the fixed stars because they are so far away. In fact, only solar and

 lunar parallax were tabulated and, for purposes of calculating the conditions of a solar

 eclipse, only the difference between lunar and solar parallax was considered.

 The tables for parallax in longitude and latitude in Ibn al-Kammâd's zij derive from
 an Indian tradition and are very different from those in the Almagest and the Handy

 Tables that were widely used in the Middle Ages: for the tradition of the Handy Tables
 see, e.g., Toomer (1968, pp.97-112). The sources for the Indian astronomical tradi
 tion concerning parallax that influenced Islamic astronomers are the Sûrya-Siddhânta
 and the Khandakhâdyaka, as noted in Neugebauer (1962a, pp. 122-124); cf. Burgess
 (trans.) [I860] 1935, pp. 149-151, and Sengupta (trans.) 1934, pp. 98, 104. The basic

 insight of this Indian tradition is that the latitudinal component of parallax is the same

 for all points on the ecliptic at a given moment, an approach which was not properly
 articulated until Kepler did so (Neugebauer 1962a, p. 124).

 10.1 Latitude

 MS M 53r; MS F 59v

 This table displays the adjusted parallax in latitude, Ρ β, in minutes and seconds of arc,
 where "adjusted parallax" means the difference between the lunar and the solar parallax
 (see Kennedy 1965b, p. 35). Its maximum value is 0;48,32° at 90°. A similar table
 appears in al-Khwârizmï's zij (Suter 1914, pp. 191-192, column headed "Diversitas
 respectus in latitudine"), but the values tabulated there differ in all cases, e.g., the
 entry for 90° is 0;48,45°. This specific table was discussed by Neugebauer (1962a,
 pp. 121-123), who showed that this value corresponded to the definition of adjusted
 horizontal parallax given in the Khandakhâdyaka (cf. Kennedy and Faris 1970, p. 26).

 The same table is extant in Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh State Library, MS 298 (Mestres
 1996, p. 423; 1999, p. 83).

 Among the eclipse tables attributed to Yahyâ ibn Abï Mansur, analyzed by Kennedy

 and Faris (1970), there is one entitled "table for the solar latitude" (jadwal card al

 shams), preserved in El Escorial, MS Ar. 927, ff. lOv and 71v, which agrees with
 the corresponding table in al-Muqtabis. According to these two authors (p. 26), the
 calculator "did an extraordinarily bad job"; a "reasonably accurate approximation"
 of the entries for the latitudinal component of the adjusted parallax is given by the
 modern formula:

 Ρβ — 0;48,32 χ sinzi,

 where z\ is the zenith distance (see Fig. 3). The value 0;48,32° is to be understood as

 the horizontal parallax (at 90° from the zenith) and arc ζ ι is the distance from the zenith

 to the nonagesimal on the ecliptic (the highest point on the ecliptic at a given moment
 in time), where the ecliptic is perpendicular to the altitude circle and the longitudinal

 component of parallax is zero. This value of Ρ β then applies to all points on the ecliptic
 at that moment in time. We note that 0;48,32° probably derives from a Ptolemaic
 parameter for the obliquity of the ecliptic, for 2 χ sin 23;51,20° — 0;48,31,55°,
 rather than from an obliquity of 24°, for 2 χ sin 24° = 0:48,48,30°. Table 28 displays
 selected values from both al-Muqtabis and the zij of al-Khwârizmï.

 An analogous table, with a maximum of 0;48,34° (instead of 0;48,32°), is found in
 the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, p. 235; Chabâs 1996a, pp. 509-510), sharing
 the inconsistencies of its antecedent in al-Muqtabis. The table in al-Muqtabis is also
 found in Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica, MS Pal. lat. 1414, f. 142v.

 As regards Ibn al-Waqâr, his table for parallax for the latitude of Toledo (MS W
 54a) does not follow the format used by Ibn al-Kammâd in his zij; rather, it is similar

 to those appearing in the Handy Tables and the Toledan Tables, among others (see
 Chabâs and Goldstein 2012, p. 132, Table 12.1B).

 Juan Gil has a table with the heading "Table of the degrees of parallax in longitude

 and latitude" (MS G 90a). The argument, "Degrees of the longitude and latitude of

 cities," ranges from 1° to 90° at intervals of 1°. The columns for the entries are labeled

 "Minutes and seconds of longitude and latitude of the Moon." The entry for 1° is

 0;50', for 10° is 8;27', and for 90° is 48;32', as in MSS M and F, Table 28 (despite the

 headings in MS G).

 The canons to the tables of Judah ben Asher (d. 1391) are extant in a unique copy

 in a poor state of preservation in Vatican, MS Heb. 384, ff. 284a-341b (cf. Richler

 2008, p. 329; see now Goldstein and Chabâs 2015). In the long discussion devoted

 to parallax, there are references to tables for parallax in longitude and in latitude that

 seem to describe the two columns for parallax in the zij of al-Khwârizmï. Moreover, in

 Chapter 40 of these canons, two methods for computing parallax are discussed, where

 the second involves computation according to the Indian procedure (see Goldstein and
 Chabâs 1999, pp. 190-191).

 10.2 Longitude

 MS M 53v; MS F 59v

 This table (see Table 29) gives the longitudinal component of the adjusted parallax,

 Ρχ, in hours and minutes, as a function of the argument, given in time from 0;15h to 9h,

 at intervals of 0;15h. The entries reach a maximum of l;36h and can be easily derived

 from the column with the heading "Horae diversorum/diversitatis respectuum lunae

 [in longitudine]" in al-Khwârizmï's zij (Suter 1914, pp. 191-192; see also Neugebauer

 1962a, pp. 125-126). However, in the zij of al-Khwârizmï the argument is not given

 in time, but in degrees, and the parallax in longitude is given to seconds. Kennedy

 (1965b, pp. 49-50) has shown that al-Khwârizmï's table can be computed by means
 of the following modern formula:

 Ρχ = 1;36 χ sin0(i),

 where θ is the solution of the equation

 t = θ — (ε χ sin#),

 t — θ — (24 χ sin#)/15,

 for all 0° < θ < 135°. We note that 135° = 9h χ 15°/h, and 9h is the maximum

 value of the argument, expressed in time.

 The formula for computing the longitudinal component of parallax depends on

 solving a plane right triangle (as an approximation of the spherical triangle) two
 of whose sides are known: the hypotenuse is the total parallax at a given point

 on the ecliptic, and one side is the latitudinal component of latitude (already com

 puted). The third side of this triangle is the longitudinal component that is sought: see

 where

 that is solved by an iterative process, and Θ, the argument (in degrees), meets the
 condition 0° < θ < 150°. The coefficient 1 ;36 = 0;4 χ 24 = 24/15 includes the

 standard Indian value for the obliquity of the ecliptic, 24°.

 Analogously, in the case of Ibn al-Kammâd's table, the entries can be recomputed

 by means of the equation

 Ρχ = 1;36 χ sin#(i),

 Ibn al-Kammâd's Muqtabis zij and the astronomical tradition.

 623

 The formula, as given in the Khandakhâdyaka, is equivalent to:

 Ρχ = Pq sin a χ sin Δλ,

 where Pq is the horizontal parallax. As Neugebauer (1962a, p. 123) proves in detail,

 this formula can be derived by solving for MB (= Ρχ) in right triangle ABM, using

 the Pythagorean theorem, where MA = Ρ and ΒΑ = Ρβ\

 and

 Ρ = Po sin Z2

 Ρβ = Po sinzi.

 One also has to solve spherical right triangle MCH (Fig. 3) for angle a (= ZMHC).
 Since ZH = 90° = VH, Η is the pole of arc ZVD and angle a is equal to arc VD =
 90° - Z}. Then, in right spherical triangle MCH, HM = 90° - Δλ, MC = 90° - Z2,
 and

 sina = sin MC/sin HM = coszi = cosz2/cos Δλ.

 Very few tables of this kind are known. In the East, there is the table of al-Khwârizmï

 and the one discovered by Kennedy (1965b, p. 48) in the zij of Ibn al-Shâtir (ca. 1350),

 explicitly paraphrasing an early Islamic source that has not been identified (Kennedy

 and Faris 1970, pp. 20-21 and 33-38). In the West, besides this table in the zij of Ibn

 al-Kammâd, we know of one in the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, p. 234; Chabâs
 1996a, p. 508-509) and another in Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414, f. 143r, whose entries

 all agree with those in al-Muqtabis. An analogous table is extant in the recension of

 Ibn-Ishâq's zij in the Hyderabad manuscript (Mestres 1999, p. 82).

 Juan Gil has a table for parallax (MS G 90a) with the title, 'Table for the lunar

 parallax in longitude according to increasing [lit.: higher] degrees on the ecliptic."

 The argument, with the heading "Degrees of the Moon's distance [in longitude] from
 mid-heaven" ranges from 1° to 90° at l°-intervals. Here, "mid-heaven" refers to the

 nonagesimal (Neugebauer 1962a, p. 71 and 124). The entry for 1° is 0;2h, for 30° it

 is 0;48h, and for 90° it is l;36h. However, despite the title and the heading, the table

 assumes that the horizontal parallax is l;36h and the entries are the total parallax,
 P, where the argument is the zenith distance, rather than the lunar distance from the

 nonagesimal. The parameter l;36h is the same as the maximum entry in the table in
 al-Muqtabis (see Table 29, above), but the structure of Juan Gil's table is different. As

 is clear from the entry for 30° which is half that for 90°, the table was computed by
 means of the formula

 Ρ = l;36sinz2·

 A table that has the same maximum 1 ;36h (for argument 66°), with the argument in

 degrees from 0;30° to 120°, is found in Ibn al-Raqqàm's Mustawfi zij (Samsô 2014,
 pp. 321-322).

 11 Syzygies

 11.1 Elongation

 MS M 53v; MS F 57r

 In this table, the argument is the elongation between the Moon and the Sun, given
 in degrees and minutes, from 0;30° to 12;0°, at intervals of 0;30°. The two other
 columns are headed "the amount for the Sun" and "the amount for the Moon" and

 represent the solar longitude (Ls = e/12) and the lunar longitude (Lm = 13e/12),
 respectively, from which it follows that e = Lm - Ls : see Table 30.

 Exactly the same table, without any variants, is found in Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414,

 f. 142v. A similar, but more extensive table, appears in the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs

 1962, p. 229; Chabâs 1996a, pp. 506-507), where the elongation is given at intervals
 of0;6° instead of 0; 30°, and its range is from 0° to 13; 12° instead of from 0° to 12;0°.

 No such table is found in the zij of Ibn Waqâr.

 MS G displays two tables, one for the Sun (91b), headed 'Table for the elongation

 of the two luminaries and the motion of the Sun, and it is a table for its elongation and

 a half of a sixth of it," and one for the Moon (92a), headed "Table for the elongation of

 the two luminaries and the motion of the Moon, and it is a table for its elongation and

 half of a sixth of it." In both cases, they are double-argument tables where the vertical

 argument ranges from 1' to 60' and the columns are labeled 0° to 11° at l°-intervals.

 The entries are in degrees and minutes; it is strange that, despite the fact that there are

 many more entries, the precision is only to minutes.

 11.2 Time from mean to true syzygy

 MS M 52r; MS F 58v

 This is a double-argument table to determine the time from mean to true syzygy as a

 function of the elongation between the Sun and the Moon, η, and their relative hourly

 velocity, vm - vs (Table 31). The vertical argument, the elongation, is displayed from

 These values seem to belong to the column labeled 33 ;0, and the values there to this column

 0;30° to 12;0° at intervals of 0;30°, and the horizontal argument, the velocity in

 elongation, from 0;27,30°/h to 0;33,30°/h at intervals of 0;0,30°/h. The entries,

 given in hours and minutes, are obtained by dividing the elongation by the relative

 hourly velocity, but the results are rather crude. They represent the time that the Moon

 takes to travel the longitudinal arc between the Sun and the Moon at mean syzygy, i.e.,

 the time interval from mean to true syzygy. For an extensive study of the approaches

 used by medieval astronomers to determine this time interval, see Chabâs and Goldstein

 1997 (reprinted in Chabâs and Goldstein 2015, pp. 40-56). Although not displayed

 in the excerpt given in Table 31, in MS M the columns for 0;32,0°/h and 0;32,30°/h

 are surprisingly identical, and the second halves of the last two columns seem to be

 interchanged. The entries in MS F are in agreement with MS M, and the errors in

 common suggest that they were already in the Arabic archetype.

 Table 31 is not among those found in Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414. The zij of Juan Gil

 contains a table very similar in structure and presentation, except for the fact that it

 displays many more entries, for the vertical argument is given at intervals of 6° from

 Os 6° to 12s 0°, and the entries were computed more accurately (MS G 92b-93b).

 Another similar, but not quite identical, table is found in the Tables of Barcelona
 (Millâs 1962, pp. 230-231; Chabâs 1996a, pp. 507-508). In this case, the vertical
 argument is given from 0; 10° to 6;40°, at intervals of 0; 10°, whereas the horizon

 tal argument ranges only from 0;28°/h to 0;33,30°/h, although the same interval,

 0;30°/h, is maintained. Also, here the entries for columns 0;32,0°/h and 0;32,30°/h

 are suspiciously alike (in fact, they are identical 35 times out of 40). The zij of Ibn

 Waqàr addresses the issue of the time from mean to true syzygy, but the approach is

 slightly different. It is a two-step procedure requiring the use of two double-argument

 tables; in the first one, a time interval is obtained for each pair of values of the elon

 gation and the lunar velocity, and this time interval serves as arguments in the second

 one, together with the solar velocity (Chabâs and Goldstein 2015, pp. 44-45).

 12 Eclipses

 12.1 Solar eclipses

 [iha-qodqodim])

 MS M 52v: "Tabula rectitudinum ad eclipses solares"; MS F 60r: Table of samt (lit.:

 Table of the zeniths [nokhhiyyot ha-ro 'sh] for solar eclipses; supra: Table of the zeniths

 This table in 7 columns gives the declination of upper mid-heaven, i.e., the intersection

 above the horizon of the ecliptic and the local meridian, in degrees and minutes, as a

 function of the longitude of the ascendant, i.e., the intersection of the ecliptic and the

 eastern horizon, in degrees. For an edition of it, see Chabâs and Goldstein (1994), p.

 15, reprinted in Chabâs and Goldstein (2015), p. 196. This table is found in the zij of

 Yahyâ ibn AbT Mansur (Kennedy and Faris 1970, pp. 21-24) with the heading "The

 table of samt for determining solar eclipses" (jadwal al-samt li-cilm kusûf al-shams).
 Note that the Arabic term samt means "direction," "azimuth," and "zenith." The table

 was compiled with a value of 23;51° for the obliquity of the ecliptic, as used by

 Ptolemy in the Handy Tables, and for a latitude of 35; 55,48° (to seconds!), as indicated

 in the manuscript containing this table (El Escorial, Biblioteca del Monasterio, MS

 Ar. 927), corresponding to Yahyà's native Tabaristàn, as reported by Kennedy and
 Faris.

 In MSS M and F, the declination reaches a maximum of +23; 50° at Vir 28°

 Lib 2° and a minimum of -23;51° at Psc 29°-Ari 1°. It is worth noting that the
 geographical latitude associated with Ibn al-Kammad is 38; 30° (Cordoba) and the
 parameter appearing in his table for solar declination is 23; 33° (MS M 35v, MS F
 40r).

 Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414, f. 141v, has the same table, with minor variants: e.g.,

 the minimum (-23;51°) occurs at Psc 30° = Ari0°.

 A similar table is found in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 3349, f. 2v, in a

 fourteenth-century manuscript for the most part in Portuguese (Chabâs and Goldstein
 2010, pp. 200-201; see also Chabâs and Goldstein 2012, p. 179) with the heading
 "Tavoa dos çomutes en Burgos", where the Portuguese term çomutes is probably

 a rendering of the Arabic sumût, the plural of samt. Although the extreme values
 are also +23;51° at Vir 29°-Lib 1° and -23;51° at Psc 29°-Ari 1°, the rest of the

 entries differ. In this case, the table seems to have been compiled for an obliquity

 of the ecliptic of 23;51° and a geographical latitude of 42°-43°. The same table is

 displayed in MS G 94a, with the heading "Table of the zeniths (ha-qodqodim) for

 Burgos," where the Hebrew term qodqodim (heads) corresponds to the Arabic sumût

 (the Arabic expression for "zenith" is often samt al-ra's: "the direction of the head").
 As far as we can determine, there are no other tables of samt in medieval Hebrew

 manuscripts. Finding this table in the zij of Juan Gil of Burgos clarifies its presence

 in the Portuguese manuscript.

 No such table is found among the Tables of Barcelona or in MS W.

 MS M 54r: "Tabula eclipsium solarium"; MS F 60v

 This second table for solar eclipses in al-Muqtabis is for determining the half-duration

 of an eclipse (Table 32). Actually, it is a combination of two tables. On the one hand,

 column 2 for the magnitude of the eclipse, given in linear digits and minutes, is the

 vertical argument of a double-argument table including all columns to the right, where

 the horizontal argument is the hourly relative velocity of the Sun to the Moon, from

 0;27,30°/h to 0;33,30°/h at intervals of 0;l°/h; on the other hand, columns 1 and

 2 form a different table, where column 1 lists the adjusted latitude (at conjunction)
 of the Moon, ranging from 0;34,13° to 0°. The entries in MS F in all columns agree

 with those in MS M, but for minor variants. As was the case for some previous tables,

 this one seems to derive from Yahyà ibn Abî Mansûr (El Escorial, MS Ar. 927, f.

 13r). Kennedy and Faris (1970, pp. 27-30) transcribed and analyzed this table. They

 restored the first three entries in column 2 to 0;0, 0;20, and 0;40 and recomputed

 the entries in the table with "only rough agreement" (p. 29) from rules described by

 Brahmagupta, known to early Islamic astronomers as part of the Sindhind tradition.

 These rules are also preserved in Ibn al-Muthannà's commentary on al-Khwàrizmî's
 zij (Goldstein 1967a, pp. 104-108, 226-230).

 The analogous table in Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414, f. 142r, agrees with that in Table

 32 except for variant readings, and it agrees for the first three values of column 2.

 However, the entries in column 1 differ substantially in the seconds, for in most cases

 they read 20 or 48.

 In MS G 96b-97a, there is a similar table for solar eclipses arranged in the same
 way (with columns labeled from 27;30 to 33;30), but the rows in the column for the

 magnitude in digits are labeled at intervals of 0;20 instead of 0;15, as in Ibn Kammâd's

 zij. Moreover, the entries are different where the argument is the same.

 12.2 Lunar Eclipses

 MS M 52v; MSF61r

 This table in 4 columns (see Table 33) displays the magnitude of a lunar eclipse, in
 digits and minutes of a digit (column 2, here called prima porta)·, the duration of

 the eclipse, in hours, minutes, and seconds (column 3, here secunda porta)·, and the

 duration of totality, also in hours, minutes, and seconds (column 4, tercia porta), as

 functions of the argument of latitude of the Moon, given in integer degrees.

 It is noteworthy that in this zij there is only a single table for lunar eclipses, whereas

 other zijes display two distinct tables, one for greatest and the other for least distances.

 Similarly, in Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414, f. 143r, we find the same table as in MS M;

 and so it is in the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962, p. 238, and Chabâs 1996a, p. 512),
 both with variants.

 The table in MS G 97a has the same format, but the argument is given at intervals

 of 0; 30° and the entries, very faint in the copy of the manuscript available to us, seem
 to be different.

 Among the material in MS M that comes after the tables associated with al

 Muqtabis, is a table of the same type (f. 57v), with the title: "Hec tabula est quam
 extraxit et composuit Alkemed in eclipsibus lunaris in canone suo que est extrada a

 canone Ebi Iusufi cognoscitur Byn Tarach, que est ualde uerax" (see Table 34). This

 author is probably the late eighth-century astronomer Yacqub ibn Târiq, a collabora

 tor of al-Fazàrï in Baghdad, whose lost zij was based on the Sindhind tradition (cf.

 Pingree 1968b and 1970). Comparison between Tables 33 and 34 shows that many of

 the entries are corrupt; see especially those for the duration of the eclipse, with close

 similarities in the minutes and seconds, but significant disagreements in the hours.

 Ibn Ishâq's zij contains two sets of tables for lunar eclipses taken from Ibn al

 Kammâd's al-Kawr (Mestres 1996, p. 422; Mestres 1999, pp. 110-111). For another
 table of lunar eclipses in MS M, see Sect. 16.3, below.

 12.3 Colors of eclipses

 MS M 52v: "Colores"·, MS F 61r: Colors of eclipses

 The discussion of colors of eclipses derives from Indian astronomy, and tables for

 them appear in some medieval astronomical texts: for the Indian tradition, see, e.g.,
 Sûrya-Siddhânta vi.23, in Burgess (trans.) [1860] 1935, p. 185; cf. Petri (1968). The

 table in the zij of Ibn al-Kammâd is presented in 6 columns. The first four correspond

 strictly to a table of colors for both solar and lunar eclipses: Column 1 displays the

 argument of lunar latitude, in degrees; column 2 gives the color of solar eclipses as

 a function of it; column 3 displays lunar latitude, in minutes; and column 4 gives the

 color of lunar eclipses in terms of lunar latitude. For a reproduction and discussion of

 this part of the table, see Chabâs and Goldstein (1994), pp. 18-19, Goldstein (2005),
 and Chabâs and Goldstein (2012), pp. 176-179. Columns 5 and 6 concern the areas

 of solar eclipses and are usually found in a separate table, displaying the magnitudes

 of solar eclipses in area digits as a function of the magnitude of the eclipse in linear
 digits (see Table 35).

 As far as we can determine, there is no other medieval text where the information

 is presented in a single table of six columns. Indeed, these two topics correspond to

 different traditions. The table for the magnitude of solar eclipses is already found,

 with variants, together with an extra column for the magnitude of lunar eclipses,

 in Ptolemy's Almagest VI.8 (Toomer 1984, p. 308) and his Handy Tables (Stahlman

 1959, p. 258), in al-Khwârizmï's zij (Suter 1914, p. 190, columns 6-7), al-Battànï's zij

 (Nallino 1903-1907, 2: 89), the Toledan Tables (Toomer 1968, p. 113; F. S. Pedersen
 2004, pp. 1448-1452), and the Almanac of Azarquiel (Millâs 1943-50, p. 233), to
 name but a few.

 The zij of Ibn al-Bannà' includes a similar list, restricted to the colors of the two

 luminaries during eclipses, and a separate table for the digits of eclipse (Madrid, Museo

 Naval, MS Arabic (unnumbered), f. 37a; cf. Vernet 1951, p. 134). The corresponding

 list for the colors of eclipses in the zij of Abu 1-Hasan cAlï al-Qusantînï is essentially

 the same as that in the zij of Ibn al-Bannâ' (Kennedy and King 1982, p. 21). The Tables

 of Barcelona present the information on colors and magnitudes of eclipses given by

 Ibn al-Kammâd, but displayed in two separate tables (Millâs 1962: cols. 1-4 in table
 51, p. 238, and cols. 5-6 in table 48, p. 228; see, e.g., Ripoll, MS 21, ff. 148r and
 147v, respectively). In Vatican, MS Pal. lat. 1414, f. 143r, there is only the table for

 the colors of eclipses. The zij of Ibn Ishàq also has two sub-tables for the colors of
 lunar and solar eclipses (Mestres 1996, p. 419). For an outstanding example of the

 persistence of the Indian tradition on colors of eclipses, see the table for this purpose

 included in the editio princeps of the Parisian Alfonsine Tables (Ratdolt 1483, f. 18v),

 soon followed by the second edition (Venice 1492, f. k2v) and the third edition (Venice

 1518, f. 116v). It should also be kept in mind that the Libro de las Taulas Alfonsies,

 explaining the use of the Castilian Alfonsine Tables, has a chapter describing such a

 table, with the title "De qué color sera ell eclipsy": see Chabâs and Goldstein 2003,
 pp. 70, 196-199.

 For the related Hebrew tradition of colors of eclipses, see Goldstein (2005), where

 editions of the tables by Juan Gil and Isaac al-Hadib, among others, are presented.

 Ibn al-Kammâd's Muqtabis zij and the astronomical tradition..

 631

 This is a list of 30 stars, and it displays the following information for each star: mag

 nitude, name, ecliptic coordinates (longitude and latitude), and the planets associated

 with it (for astrological purposes). Kunitzsch (1966), pp. 99-102, edited this list under

 his type XV based on the only two known Latin manuscripts containing it: MS M and

 Vienna, Nationalbibliothek, MS 5311, f. 129v. The ecliptic longitude of each star is

 derived from that in Ptolemy's star catalogue by adding 6; 38°, thus indicating that

 the epoch of this star list is the Hijra. A third such list has recently been identified

 in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS 7324, but only the names of the stars

 and the associated planets are displayed, not the coordinates (Chabâs 2015). Besides

 these three Latin manuscripts, Ibn al-Kammâd's star list is preserved in at least four

 Arabic manuscripts and seven Hebrew manuscripts (see Goldstein and Chabâs (1996);

 reprinted in Chabâs and Goldstein (2015), pp. 373-388, with an edition of the list in
 Arabic in MS Vatican Heb. 379, f. 195b, and in Hebrew in MS Vatican Heb. 356, f.
 65b).

 MS F has only 29 stars, not 30: most of the names are in Hebrew, but some are in
 Arabic in Hebrew characters. In contrast to MS M which lists two stars in Pisces, MS

 F has only one star in that zodiacal sign. The Hebrew terms are not the same as those
 in MS Vatican Heb. 356, that is, Solomon Franco's translation into Hebrew of the star

 names in Arabic is an independent witness of this tradition. Moreover, the stars are
 not in the same order as in MS M, and there are variants for the numerical entries.

 MS G 149a has a list of 32 stars: in addition to the name, longitude, latitude, and

 associated planets, there are columns headed "degrees with which they cross the 9th

 sphere," "degrees with which they cross the meridian," "distance from the equator," and

 "direction with respect to the equator" (i.e., north or south): cf. Chabâs and Goldstein

 2015, pp. 378-379, where this manuscript was designated "J."

 MS W 59a has the same list of 30 stars (as in Ibn al-Kammàd), with their longitudes

 and latitudes.

 The Tables of Barcelona have no specific list of stars. Nevertheless, the fact that

 some of the Hebrew manuscripts displaying Ibn al-Kammâd's list also contain copies

 of the Tables of Barcelona, and the fact that in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France,

 MS 7324, this list follows another one explicitly associated with the astronomers who
 worked on the compilation of the Tables of Barcelona, lead us to think that Ibn al
 Kammâd's star list was included in this set of tables.

 Zacut's Hibbur has a list of 61 stars, whose longitudes differ by 6;38° from those

 stars listed in Ptolemy's Almagest, and is thus intended for the Hijra, as is also the
 case for Ibn al-Kammâd's star list. For an excerpt of Zacut's list, see Chabâs and
 Goldstein (2000), p. 71. The Almanach Perpetuum based on Zacut's tables has a list

 of coordinates of 56 stars, very similar to that in the Hibbur, but here the names are

 missing, making the list unusable (see Chabâs and Goldstein 2000, pp. 145-150).

 14 Geographical list

 This table consists of a list of 30 geographical places both in MS M and in MS F,

 for each of which we are given its longitude and latitude, in degrees and minutes (see

 Table 36). The list in MS F is very similar to that in MS M, but has only 24 places

 in common with MS M; there are also differences in the order of the geographical

 places, their coordinates, and the spelling of their names. In the margin of MS F, Juan

 Gil is mentioned together with two additional places: Burgos, with coordinates 27°
 and 42°, and Valencia, for which only the latitude, 39°, is given. Note that this city

 already appears in MS M, with different latitude.

 The list in MS M was edited in Laguarda (1990), p. 103. The longitudes of the cities
 differ from those in the Toledan Tables, where the shore of the Western Ocean seems

 to have been used as the meridian of reference for most longitudes (see Toomer 1968,

 p. 136). However, the prime meridian in this list is located about 17;30° west of the
 shore of the Western Ocean and was called "the meridian of water" for it fell in the

 middle of the ocean (Laguarda 1990, p. 75; Comes 1994). For a general discussion of

 the prime meridian in Islamic sources, see Kennedy and Kennedy (1987), p. xi. As an

 example, let us consider the case of Cordoba: the entry for its longitude is 27;0° and
 that for its latitude 3 8 ; 30°. The same values for the coordinates of Cordoba are found in

 some other Islamic sources, notably in a work by Abu 1-Hasanc Alî al-Marrâkushï (see

 Kennedy and Kennedy 1987, p. 95). By contrast, in the Toledan Tables, the longitude

 of Cordoba is given as 9;20° and its latitude as 38; 30° (Toomer 1968, p. 134; Pedersen

 2002, p. 1512). The difference in longitude is 17; 40°. Similarly, the coordinates for
 Toledo in Ibn al-Kammâd's list are 28;0° and 40;0°, whereas in the Toledan Tables

 they are given as 11;0° and 40;0°. In this case, the difference in longitude is 17°.

 It is worth noting that the meridian of water was also used in Hyderabad, Andra

 Pradesh State Library, MS 298: Ibn Ishàq's original set of radices was computed for

 the longitude of Toledo, given as 28°, but the anonymous compiler of the zij computed

 new radices for Tunis, whose longitude is given as 41;45° (Mestres 1999, p. 26).

 Table 37 displays the modern names of the places in Table 36. In the 17 cases

 where these places are also found in the standard table for geographical coordinates
 (62 items) in the Toledan Tables (see Toomer 1968, pp. 134-135, and Pedersen 2002,

 pp. 1512-1513), we present the difference between the longitude given in the Toledan

 Tables and that in Ibn al-Kammâd's list. Note that Antioquia and Aliememe (Carmel)
 are given the same coordinates, but located in different climates.

 A glance at the names shows that Ibn al-Kammâd's list is much more oriented to

 al-Andalus than that in the Toledan Tables, and that faraway places like Insula Tule

 in the Arctic Ocean and Albeyt in Tibet do not appear in it. While keeping to the
 tradition, Ibn al-Kammâd probably tried to make this list more useful to his fellow

 astronomers in al-Andalus. We also note that, contrary to the list in the Toledan Tables,

 Ibn al-Kammâd's list in MS M is organized according to increasing longitudes, which
 is not the case for the last 8 entries in MS F.

 MS G 148a displays a list of 45 geographical places, many of which agree with

 those in MS M (especially at the beginning of the list). Some places have been added,
 including (among others) Burgos, Paris, Tunis, Rome, and Armenia. MS W 59a has

 a list of 30 places, but it seems to be unrelated to the list in Ibn Kammàd. Among the

 places listed in MS W are Burgos and Lisbon.

 The Tables of Barcelona include a list of 29 geographical places, partially derived
 from that of Ibn al-Kammâd: eleven cities are given in the same order and with the

 same coordinates, but for variant readings (Millâs 1962, p. 238, and Chabâs 1996a,

 pp. 515-516). For the rest, while retaining cities such as Alexandria, Jerusalem, and

 Mecca, the author included Barcelona and other places close to it, such as Girona,

 Montpellier, Majorca, and Minorca.

 15 Astrology

 15.1 Excess of revolution

 MS M 54v; MS F 61r

 The "excess of revolution" is the difference between a tropical or sidereal year and

 365d. As can be seen from the entries for one year in Tables 38 and 39, this quantity

 exceeds 6 hours or 90 time degrees (such that lh = 15°), indicating that the entries are

 sidereal and refer to a sidereal year. This quantity was used in an astrological context

 to determine the ascendant of the anniversary of someone's nativity.

 MS M has two sub-tables with the heading "Reuoluciones annorum mundi et natiui

 tatum." The entries in one are given as an angle, in degrees and minutes, and in the other
 as time, in hours and minutes. MS F has both sub-tables: the first one is headed "Table

 for the cycles of the years of the nativities and the years of the world (supra: and some

 call it the table for the ascensional cycles)," and its entries are expressed in degrees,

 minutes, and seconds. The second sub-table in MS F is headed "excess of the peratim,"

 where the usage of peratim (sing, perat) is unusual: it generally means "details," but

 elsewhere in this manuscript perat has the meaning of "era" or "calendar" (see Sect. 1,

 above; cf. Goldstein (2013), p. 176). The meaning in this context is unclear. Tables
 38 and 39 show one sub-table from each manuscript. In the first sub-table, extant in

 both MSS but with greater precision in MS F, the entry for lOOyears (or for 1 year)
 results in a year-length of 365;15,36,0,30d = 365d 6; 14,24,12h. In the second sub

 table, the entry for 100 years implies a length of the solar year of 365; 15,35,58,30
 days, a value close, but not equal, to the parameter derived from the previous
 sub-table.

 The table for the excess of revolution in the zij of Ibn al-Kammâd differs from that in

 al-Khwârizmï (Suter 1914, p. 230), where the entries for 1 year are 93;2;15° and 6;12h.

 However, in MS M 66r, we find a copy, but for scribal errors, of al-Khwàrizmï's table,
 with the title, Residuum ascensionum ad reuoluciones annorum solarium secundum

 Muhad Arcadius. Millâs (1942, p. 246) identified Muhad Arcadius with Ibn Mucâdh

 al-Jayyânï, from Jaén (11th century). The entries in this table correspond to a sidereal

 year of 365;15,30,22 days, a parameter already found in an Indian astronomical text,
 Brahmagupta's Brahmasphutasiddhânta (ca. 625 A.D.): Pingree (1968b), p. 99, and

 Kennedy (1958), p. 261; see also Neugebauer (1962a), p. 131, and Goldstein (1967a),

 According to Mestres (1999, p. 15, n. 2), Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh State Library,

 MS 298, preserves the table for the excess of revolution in Ibn al-Kammàd's first zij,

 al-Amad calâ l-Abad, and it yields a year-length of 365;15,23,30 days.

 The zij of Joseph of Ibn Waqâr gives the excess of revolution only as an angle, to

 minutes (MS W 57b), and the relevant parameter is 92;36°, the same as in MS M.

 p. 242.

 However, the rest of the entries indicate that this is an error for 92; 26° (e.g., the entry

 for 10 years is 204; 16°). Moreover, in El Escorial, MS Arabe 873, copied by, among

 others, Judah Ibn Waqâr (a member of Joseph's family), in part in Toledo in 1379 and

 in part in Guadalajara in 1387 and 1388, we find the same table, given to seconds.
 In this case, the entry for one year is 92;25,46° and that for 10 years 204;15,40° (see

 Castells 1991, pp. 44-48). Thus, Joseph's table seems to be a rounding of Judah's,
 with no direct relation to the table by Ibn al-Kammâd.

 In the Tables of Barcelona (Millâs 1962; p. 238), the entries for one year (6;lh and

 90;15°) also seem to be unrelated to those in the zij of Ibn al-Kammâd.

 15.2 Ruling powers of the planets

 MS M 65r; MS F 63r

 The interpretation of a horoscope depends for the most part on three astrological sys

 tems: (1) dignities, (2) astrological houses, and (3) aspects. The dignities are assigned
 to fixed points or intervals on the zodiac, and there are five categories: domiciles,

 J. Chabâs, Β. R. Goldstein

 exaltations, triplicities, terms, and faces. Opposite the domicile is the detriment, and

 opposite the exaltation is the dejection (or fall). Astrological houses are tied to the

 local horizon, and they constitute a 12-fold division of the zodiac, beginning with the

 ascendant (the intersection of the eastern horizon with the ecliptic at a given time).

 Aspects refer to the relative positions of the planets at a given time. Ibn al-Kammâd

 has a table for dignities, but in his tables he does not address the other two systems.

 According to Kûshyâr Ibn Labbàn (tenth century: see Yano (ed. and trans.) 1997, pp.

 54-55), the five categories of dignities are "essential" (dhâtîya), whereas the astro

 logical houses and aspects are "accidental" (caradxya), in so far as they depend on

 positions that vary over time (cf. Lilly 1647, pp. 101-104). To be sure, in an astro
 nomical context dhâtî (lit. essential) means "sidereal" in contrast to tabfï(lit. natural)

 which means "tropical": see Samsô (2007), essay 9, pp. 107-108. But for the tables

 discussed in this section, the context is astrological.

 MS M has four sub-tables, and the information they provide generally agrees with

 that in the zij of al-Khwàrizmî (Suter 1914, p. 231; Neugebauer 1962a, p. 132), but

 comparison is made difficult by the fact that in MS M every other entry was copied

 (in red) while the rest of them, probably intended to be copied in blue ink, were left
 blank.

 The first sub-table is for the dignities of the planets in the zodiacal signs. The

 table consists of five columns and seven rows. The first column displays the seven

 planets (in the Middle Ages, this included the five planets visible to the naked eye,
 the Sun, and the Moon). The other four columns are for the domiciles, the exaltations,

 the detriments, and the dejections (here called casus). This sub-table has a different

 presentation from that in the zij of al-Khwârizmï.

 The second sub-table in MS M displays the lords of the triplicities, both diurnal and

 nocturnal. The table consists of seven columns and four rows. The first column displays

 four groups of three signs: Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn;

 Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius; and Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. Each group of three

 signs is associated with three planets for daytime and three others for nighttime.

 The third sub-table is for the faces. The table consists of four columns, of which the

 first lists the 12 zodiacal signs. Each of them is divided into three equal parts, called

 "faces" or "decans," according to a well-established descending order: Mars, Sun, and

 Venus for Aries, then Mercury, Moon, and Saturn for Taurus, then Jupiter, Mars, and

 so on, until the last third of Pisces (Mars). For a transcription, see Pedersen (2002),

 p. 1593.

 The fourth sub-table presents the "Egyptian terms" (which are called "Persian" in

 al-Khwârizmï's zij). The table consists of six columns, of which the first lists the 12

 zodiacal signs. The principle is the following: each sign is divided into 5 unequal parts,

 called "terms," and each term is assigned to one of the 5 planets and is given an integer

 number between 2 to 12, in such a way that the sum of these numbers for each zodiacal

 sign must equal 30°. In Tetrabiblos 1.20-21, Ptolemy lists terms in two systems, one

 associated with the Egyptians and another introduced by Ptolemy in his own name.

 For a transcription, see Robbins 1940, p. 97, and Pedersen (2002), p. 1594.

 MS F 63r displays a single table, entitled "Table for the essential lordship of the

 planets in the zodiac." The Hebrew term corresponding to "essential" (casmit) suggests

 that the underlying Arabic term is dhâtîya (or, dhâtî if the noun it modified in Arabic

 was masculine): for a similar construction in Arabic, see the discussion of MS W 58a,

 below. The term "essential" here refers to the fact that the lords of the dignities are

 associated with specific points or intervals on the zodiac that are independent of time.

 For discussion of the astrological dignities in a medieval Hebrew text, see Sela 2013,
 pp.91, 101, 222-223, and 239.

 The entries in the table in MS F 63r are mostly too faint to read (at least in the

 copy available to us), but enough of them are legible to reconstruct the table, given

 similar information in other texts. There are eight columns with the following headings:

 domicile, detriment, exaltation, dejection, diurnal triplicities, nocturnal triplicities,

 terms according to the Egyptians, and faces. There are twelve rows, one for each

 zodiacal sign. The entries display the names of one or more planets. For a list of

 the domiciles and detriments (each zodiacal sign is governed by a planet), see, e.g.,

 Wright (ed. and trans.) (1934), pp. 256-257; for a list of exaltations and dejections

 (a specific degree in one of the zodiacal signs for each planet), see, e.g., Wright (ed.

 and trans.) (1934), p. 258. For a list of the diurnal and nocturnal triplicities, see, e.g.,

 Suter 1914, p. 231; for a list of the terms, see, e.g., Suter (1914), p. 231; and for a

 list of the faces, see, e.g., Suter (1914), p. 231. For an overview of the dignities, see
 Chabâs and Goldstein (2012), pp. 215-218.

 The same data on the astrological dignities (together with other data) are found in

 MS W 58a; however, the presentation of the astrological data is different from, and

 probably unrelated to, what is found in MS M or MS F. In MS W, the heading is

 "Table for the rulers of the dignities in the zodiac according to the essential system"

 (jadwal ashâb al-huzûzfi l-burûj calâ madhhab al-dhâtï), where the manuscript has

 ashab (instead of ashâb). The term in Arabic for dignities (huzûz; sing, hazz) generally

 means "shares," but hazz is translated dignitas in Adelard of Bath's medieval Latin

 translation of Abu Macshar's Introduction to Astrology: see Burnett et al. (1994), pp.
 14-15, and 94-95.

 In MS G 99a, the information on the astrological dignities is displayed in a diagram
 consisting of a series of concentric circles. Much the same information is found in
 Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS 3349 (Chabâs and Goldstein 2010, pp. 206-210)
 and in Munich, Staatsbibliothek, MS Heb. 109, containing Abraham Zacut's Hibbur
 (Chabâs and Goldstein 2000, pp. 86-89).

 16.1 Two tables for Azarquiel's solar theory

 MS M 55r: "Tabula motus centri circuli exeuntis centrum in longitudine longiori et

 solis exeuntis centrum de diuersitate centri eiusdem in longitudine propinquiori et

 longiori a circulo diuersitatis motus centri morantis tempus"

 These two tables present Azarquiel's solar model and facilitate computation of the
 solar equation. The text in MS M 19rb ascribes them explicitly to Azarquiel and

 gives instructions for their use. Since Toomer (1969, p. 325) reproduced excerpts and

 explained both tables, we only describe them briefly.

 The first table gives the solar mean motion of center for Arabic years (hundreds,
 tens, and units) and months. The radix is 2s 23;40,31°, and the entry for one year is

 0;6,16°. The second table has four columns. One is for the argument at intervals of
 1° from 1° to 360°. The second and third columns display the solar equation (with
 a maximum of 1;45,36° at 91°-92°) and the difference in the solar equation (with
 a maximum of 0;37,18° at 91°-92°). The argument for both these columns is the
 solar mean center. The fourth column is for the minutes of proportion, for which the

 argument is the solar mean motion of center found in the first table.

 16.2 Lunar crescent visibility

 MS M 56v: "Tabula uisuum lunarium post occasum solis in climatibus septem"

 The entries in this table represent the difference in longitude between the Sun and the

 Moon for which the difference in setting times is 12° (see Table 40). The entries, given

 in degrees and minutes, are displayed in a double-argument table for the beginning

 (?) of each zodiacal sign and for each of the seven climates.

 In his analysis of various early Islamic tables for determining the lunar crescent

 visibility, King describes 14 tables like the one presented here and suggests that they
 have an early Andalusian origin (King 1987, p. 197). A similar table is found in

 the Almanac of Azarquiel, but beginning in Libra rather than in Aries (Millâs 1943—

 50, p. 228). The table presented here also appears in zijes by Maghribi astronomers

 including Ibn Ishàq, Ibn al-Raqqâm, Ibn cAzzuz al-Qusantïnî, and Abu 1-Hasan cAlï
 al-Qusantïnï (King 1987, pp. 200 ff., cf. Kennedy and King 1982, p. 20), as well as

 in the early sixteenth-century Arabic version by Moses Galiano (Ar. Mûsâ Jalïnûs) of

 the Almanack Perpetuum (King 1987, pp. 202-203, El Escorial, MS Ar. 966, f. 192v;
 on Galiano, see Chabâs and Goldstein (2000), p. 163, Samso 2002-2003, p. 68, and
 Morrison 2011). The tables examined by King contain so many corrupt entries that he

 was led to conclude: "This table takes the prize as the most corrupt table in the known

 medieval sources" (p. 207). For an analysis of other Islamic tables for the visibility of

 the lunar crescent, see Hogendijk (1988).

 16.3 Lunar eclipses

 MS M 57r: "Tabula eclipsis lune et quot digiti eclipsantur ex ea et hore dimidii temporis
 eclipsis" (see Table 41)

 The arguments in this table are the minutes of lunar latitude. The other columns

 represent the digits of the eclipsed disk and the duration of the eclipse (in hours and

 minutes). In most zijes (e.g., al-Khwârizmï's zij), the argument is the distance of the

 Moon from the node. Normally, the minimum lunar latitude in a table for lunar eclipses

 is 0', i.e., when the Moon is at a node on the ecliptic. In al-Battânï's zij (Nallino 1903

 1907, 2: 90), the argument is the lunar latitude (as in Table 41): for argument 0;0° the

 digits of eclipse are 21;31,30d for greatest lunar distance and 21;36d for least lunar

 distance, which could be rounded to 2 Id, as in Table 41 for 1'. The corresponding half

 duration of the eclipse in al-Battânï's zij varies from 0;53h (= 0;29,30h + 0;23,30h) to

 1 ;4h (= 0; 35,20h+0; 28,56h), or a duration of about 2h, as in Table 41. In al-Battânï's

 table Od corresponds to a lunar latitude that varies from about 53' to 63' (Table 41 has

 60'), lOd from about 28' to 34' (Table 41 has 33'-34'), and 20d to a latitude of about

 4' (Table 41 has 3'-4'), that is, the entries in both tables are similar and the trend is

 the same. We are unaware of any other copy of Table 41.

 MS M 57v also has a table for lunar eclipses according to Yacqub ibn Tariq (see

 Sect. 12.2, Table 34).

 16.4 Excess of revolution according to Azarquiel

 MS M 57v: " Hec tabula composita est secundum opinionem ebyeshac ezartal"

 In Table 42, the entries are based on a yearly excess of 92;24°, corresponding to

 a sidereal year of 365;15,24d = 365d 6;9,36h, which is shorter than that given Ibn
 al-Kammâd (see Sect. 15.1).

 16.5 Latitudes of the seven climates

 MS M 57v has a table for the maximum values of geographical latitudes in the seven

 climates (see Table 43).

 Longest daylight, M, which depends on the geographical latitude, has served as a
 way to define zones of latitude which, historically, were called climates. The seven
 traditional climates have their midpoints located at values of M from 13h to 16h, in

 steps of 1/2 hour. In Almagest 11.13, the corresponding values for the geographical
 latitude are 16;27° (13h), 23;51° (13i/2h), 30;22° (14h), 36° (14i/2h), 40;56° (15h),

 45;1° (15V2h), and 48;32° (16h). The extremes of the climates are defined by the
 values of M which are 0;15h greater or smaller than those defining the midpoints.

 For example, in the zij of al-Battànï, the latitudes corresponding to the upper limit
 of the first six climates are 20;28° (13i/4h), 27;28° (133/4h), 33;37° (14i/4h), 38;54°

 (143/4h), 43;25° (15i/4h), and 47; 12° (153/4h): Nallino 1903-1907, 2: 65-66. Table

 43 gives a somewhat different list of the upper limits of all seven climates.

 16.6 Tables for chronology in al-Khwàrizmï's zij

 MS M 58r: "Tabula cuius est inter annos gentium et alios annos preter illos ad inuicem";

 MS M 58v: "Numeri dimissi per 28, 28 secundum annos romanorum et egyptiacum"

 These two sub-tables are clearly related to Table 1 in the zij of al-Khwàrizmî (Suter

 1914, p. 109), which is also presented as two sub-tables. The first one displays the

 time intervals between events considered the beginning of chronological eras. The table

 opens with the time interval between the Flood and the beginning of the Yazdegird

 (or Persian) era, and it is given as 1.1.1.4.35.10.23, indicating that the first day of the

 Flood was "the day of Jupiter" (i.e., Thursday). The date for the Flood, corresponding

 to the Indian era of the Kaliyuga, is February 17, -3101 (it was indeed a Thursday),

 and that for the Persian era is June 16, 632 (see e.g., Chabâs and Goldstein 2012, p.

 15). Since their respective Julian day numbers are 588465 and 1952063, the difference

 between them is 1,363,598 days, which corresponds exactly to the entry in the zij of

 al-Khwàrizmï: 3735 Egyptian years, 10 months, and 23 days. And indeed 3735 χ
 365 + 10 χ 30 + 23 = 1,363,598. Therefore, the beginning of the entry in MS M,

 1.1.1.4.35, has to be understood as 3735 years. We also note that the entry for the time

 interval between the Incarnation and the Hijra is given as 621 years, 4 months, and

 15 days. Since the Hijra took place in July 622, this entry means that the Julian year

 here begins in March (see Sect. 16.9, below). The second sub-table gives a list of the

 multiples of 28 (years) up to 2352, whereas in the zij of al-Khwârizmï it only gets to

 2100. According to Millâs (1942), p. 245, both sub-tables derive from Maslama rather
 than from al-Khwàrizmî.

 16.7 Mighty years

 MS M 58v: "Circuitus planetarum magni in sectis et divinationibus"

 The title refers to the "Mighty Years" of the planets, used in an astrological context. In

 Table 44, the entries of MS M are compared with those of Abu Macshar as preserved

 by al-Sijzï (Pingree 1968a, p. 64). It is readily seen that the order of the planets does

 not conform to the standard one. This seems to be a specific feature of this list, for

 other analogous tables have the standard order: see, e.g., al-Birunl (Wright (ed. and

 trans.) 1934, p. 255), where the entry for Mercury is given as 461. See also Sect. 16.11.

 16.8 Rétrogradation of the planets

 MS M 58v: "Tabula dierum prouenientium in retrogradationibus planetarum et direc
 tionibus eorum" (see Table 45).

 The Toledan Tables have a table for the rétrogradation of the planets that gathers the

 information provided in words in Almagest XII.2-6: the retrograde arcs and their cor

 responding durations for three positions (maximum, mean, and minimum distances)

 of the five planets. However, the table presented here differs substantially from it. Of

 the 6 numerical columns in Table 45, columns 2 and 6 have entries corresponding
 to, although with some differences, the retrograde arcs (in degrees) and the associ

 ated times (in days) when the planets are at mean distance. Columns 1 and 3 give

 the amount of direct motion from conjunction to first station (labeled here "to the

 left of the Sun") and from second station to conjunction ("to the right of the Sun"),

 before and after its retrograde motion, respectively. Column 4 displays the time it

 takes for the planet to complete a full loop from one phenomenon to the next phe
 nomenon of the same kind, and its entries are the sums of the entries in cols. 1,

 2, and 3, whereas column 5 represents the time the planet has progressed in direct
 motion.

 The entries in Table 45 are not internally consistent in all cases and do not always

 agree with parameters used in Indian astronomy (which are very close to those derived

 from Ptolemy's data in the Almagest: see Pedersen 1974, pp. 425-429). For example,

 the entries in column 4, which are the periods of anomaly of the planets, that is, the

 time needed to return to the same velocity, can be compared with those derived from

 the Sûrya-Siddhânta (Burgess (trans.) [I860] 1935, p. 69): 378d 2h (Saturn), 398d

 21h (Jupiter), 779d 22h (Mars), 583d 22h (Venus), and 115d 22h (Mercury). Clearly,
 for Saturn the text should read "378d and 2h," for 121d -(- 136d + 121d = 378d. In the

 case of Mars, 393d + 7 Id + 393d = 857d, which is neither the entry in column 4 nor

 the value in the SUrya-Siddhânta. From the value in column 5 for Mars, the entries in

 cols. 1 and 3 should be 363d (instead of 393d), which would be consistent with the

 entry in column 4.

 There are four sub-tables. The first gives the number of collected Julian years as a

 function of the number of Arabic years from 90 to 900, at intervals of 90 years. The

 radix (the Hijra) is given as 621 years 4months 15days (as in Sect. 16.6), indicating

 that the Julian year begins in March. The second sub-table displays the number of

 expanded Julian years as a function of the number of Arabic years from 1 to 30, at

 intervals of 1 year; entries for 60 and 90 years are also given. The two other sub-tables

 are for the Arabic and Julian months (beginning in March).

 16.10 Duration of pregnancy

 MS M 62v-64r: "Tabula extractionis annorum quantitatis durationis creature in uentre

 matris per longitudinem lune a gradu occidentis"

 This table is certainly part of al-Kawr calâ l-dawr. It deals with the astrological
 determination of the duration of pregnancy and has been discussed in Vernet (1949),

 pp. 273-300. For the rich variety of tables concerning the gestation period, see Chabâs
 and Goldstein (2012), pp. 223-226.

 16.11 Years of the Planets

 MS M 64v: "Tabula circuituum annorum planetarum in natiuitatibus"

 Table 46, the years of the planets, is related to Table 44. As was the case with pre

 vious tables in this manuscript, the entries that were filled in are all written in red

 ink, but the rest of the entries, probably intended to be written in blue ink, were

 left blank. Entries in square brackets complete the table, taking the data from al

 Blrûnï's Elements of the Art of Astrology (Wright (ed. and trans.) 1934, p. 255). The
 years associated with the planets are astrological, although some have an astronom

 ical basis. Al-BîrûnT offers the explanation that "the years of the planets are of four

 degrees, least, mean, great, and greatest [or mighty]. The last are only used for mark

 ing certain time cycles, although some people say that in ancient days the planets

 granted such long years of life. Astrologers of the present day only use the three for

 mer degrees for determining the length of life at a nativity, and the numbers which

 they thus elicit must not be interpreted literally as years, but freely, for sometimes they

 represent years but sometimes months, weeks, days, or hours" (Wright (ed. and trans.)

 1934, p. 239).

 16.12 Seasons, astrological terms, the length of the solar year, and the length of

 the synodic month

 MS M 65v: "Mediatus cursus solis in descensu eius ad quartas circuli secundum
 probationem huius canonis"

 Here, we find data for 480 A.H. (1087-88 A.D.), most likely referring to the begin

 ning of the seasons and their duration. On one side we find Aries (11.28.10.0 = lis
 28; 10,0°), Cancer (3.0.21.0 = 3s 0;21,0°), Libra (6.1.50.0 = 6s 1;50,0°), and Capri

 corn (8.29.38.0 = 8s 29; 38,0°), on the other what seem to be three durations expressed

 in days: 93.3.12.50,185.12.0.0, and 279.13.28.0.2. The positions corresponding to the

 four zodiacal signs refer to the mean positions of the Sun when the true Sun is at the

 beginning of each season. For example, when the true Sun is at Aries 0° (= 0s 0°),

 the mean Sun is at 1 Is 28; 10°, where the solar equation is 1;50°. When the true Sun
 is at Cancer 0° (= 3s 0°), the mean Sun is at 3s 0;21°, where the solar equation is
 -0;21°. If the solar apogee is taken to be near Gemini 20°(= 2s 20°) and the max
 imum solar equation about 1;53°, then according to the tables in al-Muqtabis, the
 solar equation at lis 28; 10° is about 1;52° and at 3s 0;21° it is about —0;19° (see

 Chabâs and Goldstein 2015, pp. 184 and 187). For values of the solar apogee near 2s

 20°, see Sect. 4.2, above. The lengths of the seasons in days seem to be 93;3,12,50d

 for spring, 92;8,47,10d (= 185;12,0,0d - 93;3,12,50d) for summer, and 94;l,28,0,2d

 (= 279; 13,28,0,2d - 185; 12d) for autumn. The seasonal lengths should be the interval

 in mean longitude from the beginning of one season to the next divided by the daily

 mean solar motion (« 0;59,8°/d), but the numbers in the text are not familiar to us

 and we have no explanation for them.

 On the same page, there is a table for the astrological terms, headed "Tabula ter

 minorum ciuium Babillonie ueteris qui sunt magistri ymaginum," where again every

 other entry was left blank. Separating the two halves of this astrological table horizon

 tally, two astronomical parameters are inserted: the length of the solar year "according

 to Ibn al-Kammâd" (365;15,36,19,35,32 days), for which see Sect. 15.1, and the length

 of the synodic month (29;31,50,5,1 days).

 16.13 Table by Maslama

 MS M 66r: "Tabula extrada per misilme de eo quod confirmatum extitit per ciues

 huius artis yspanenses super diuisionem Yspanie per signa duodecim 12 12 12 12."

 This table associates the 12 zodiacal signs with cities, all of them in the Iberian
 Peninsula, including Zaragoza, Cordoba, Granada, Toledo, Valencia, Tortosa, and
 Sevilla. It was transcribed by Millâs (1942, p. 246) who suggested that "misilme"
 stands for "Maslama."

 16.14 Visibility of the Planets

 MS M 66r: "Tabula uisuum planetarum et absconsionum eorum sub radiis solis"

 This table refers to the visibility of the planets (see Table 47), and for each of them it

 gives the solar depression angle (also called arcus visionis), that is, the distance from

 the Sun to the horizon on an arc through the local zenith when the planet is at its
 first or last visibility on the horizon. This quantity depends on the local horizon, but

 in Almagest XIII.7 Ptolemy restricted his data to an intermediate latitude, where the

 longest daylight is 14 i/4h and gave the following results: 11° for Saturn, 10° for Jupiter,

 11 1/2° for Mars, 5° for Venus, and 10° for Mercury. But for Jupiter, these numbers

 agree with those in Table 47 (see Toomer 1984, pp. 636-640; Neugebauer 1975, pp.

 234-238). In the Handy Tables, Ptolemy disregarded this restriction and enlarged his
 computations to the seven climates (Neugebauer 1975, pp. 256-261; Stahlman 1959,

 pp. 159-165). Later on, in his Planetary Hypotheses, Ptolemy further refined the data

 (Goldstein 1967b, p. 9), but in all cases they were given to degrees or half-degrees.

 Moreover, in the Planetary Hypotheses Ptolemy remarked that at acronychal risings

 of the outer planets (i.e., when the planet rises as the Sun sets), the arcus visionis is

 about half that for first visibility: this may explain the discordant value in the text

 for Jupiter (5; 8° in Table 47, instead of 10° in the Almagest). For visibility tables in

 Islamic astronomy, see Kennedy and Agha (1960), pp. 134-140.

 terms in Hebrew and Arabic.
