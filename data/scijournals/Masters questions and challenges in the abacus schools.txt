 Abstract The mathematical scenario in Italy during the Late Middle Ages and the

 Renaissance is mainly dominated by the treatises on the abacus, which developed

 together with the abacus schools. In that context, between approximately the last thirty

 years of the fourteenth century and the first twenty years of the sixteenth century, the

 manuscript and printed tradition tell us of queries and challenges, barely known or

 totally unknown, in which the protagonists were abacus masters. We report in this

 work on the most significant examples and draw out interesting cues for thoughts

 and remarks of a scientific, historical and biographical nature. Five treatises, written

 in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, have been the main source of inspiration for

 this article: the Trattato di praticha d'arismetricha and the Tractate di praticha di
 geometria included in the codices Palat. 573 and Palat. 577 (c. 1460) kept in the

 Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence and written by an anonymous Florentine disciple of
 the abacist Domenico di Agostino Vaiaio; another Trattato di praticha d'arismetrica
 written by Benedetto di Antonio da Firenze in 1463 and included in the codex L.IV.21

 kept in the Biblioteca Comunale of Siena; the Tractatus mathematicus ad discipulos
 perusinos written by Luca Pacioli between 1477 and 1480, manuscript Vat. Lat. 3129

 of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana; and Francesco Galigai's Summa de arithmetica,
 published in Florence in 1521.

 1 Introduction

 In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, in Italy it was customary to pose questions

 to famous mathematicians, often for the purpose of testing the interlocutor's ability,

 sometimes during actual mathematical challenges.

 Among these are the problems that Giovanni da Palermo and Master Theodore of

 Antioch submitted to Leonardo Pisano around 1225, during their encounters at the

 Court of the Emperor Frederick Π, and that Fibonacci introduced and solved a little
 later in the Liber quadratorum and in the Flos.1 Scholars are also well acquainted

 with the harsh disputes and challenges that involved Niccolô Tartaglia, Antonio Maria
 Fior, Girolamo Cardano, Zuanne de Tonini da Coi and Ludovico Ferrari, over the

 discovery of the formulae to solve third and fourth-degree equations between 1535
 and 1548. We know them thanks to the book Ars magna (1545) by Cardano, the

 Cartelli exchanged between Tartaglia and Ferrari in 1547-1548, and the Quesiti et
 inventioni diverse (1546) by Tartaglia that collects, among others, forty-two questions

 with various arithmetic, algebra and geometry problems posed to the mathematician

 from Brescia by many of his colleagues between 1521 and 1541.2

 In the period comprising approximately the last thirty years of the fourteenth century

 and the first twenty years of the sixteenth century, the manuscript and printed tradition

 tell us of other queries and challenges, barely known or totally unknown, which once

 again saw some mathematicians of that time in the vast and suggestive world of abacus
 schools.

 The appearance of the abacus schools in Italy, institutions that were perhaps unique

 in the history of Europe during the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, began

 around the mid-thirteenth century. It is documented from the last twenty years of

 the century throughout the sixteenth century, especially in the cities with a dynamic

 economy; Tuscany, with Florence first, was home to some of the most important and

 prestigious abacus schools and masters. Most of the Italian schools of abacus were

 public; in that case, it was the duty of city magistrates, local bodies and, in some cases,

 universities to appoint the masters, often taking care of their salary, which sometimes

 was paid, totally or partially, by the students' families. In Florence instead, abacus

 schools were private and had their premises in houses or shops owned or rented by

 the teachers, which for this reason were called 'botteghe d'abaco'; between the first

 half of the fourteenth century and the first thirty years of the sixteenth century, we can

 count about twenty abacus schools distributed in the four neighbourhoods of the city,

 but with a higher concentration in the Neighbourhood of Santa Maria Novella. It was

 not uncommon for two masters to cooperate in the same school.

 Usually, abacus schools were the continuation of an initial cycle of studies where

 students learned reading and writing in Latin and in the vernacular. Their main pur

 pose was training the students in commercial, banking, craftsmanship and artistic
 activities and, in general, all those activities that needed a basic mathematical cul

 ture; however, they were also attended by young men from noble families and by

 those who wished to continue their studies in order to later start a profession; more

 over, those schools were the training camps for future abacus masters. Teaching was

 divided into sections called "mute"; it would last for the entire day, and it was based

 on written and oral exercises; masters would also assign homework. The subject fol

 lowed precise programmes, partly different from school to school. It was essentially

 based on the Fibonacci's works, in particular the Liber abaci (1202, 1228) and the

 Practica geometriae (1220/21), but took inspiration from the so-called abacus trea

 tises, a body of texts that were almost always written in the vernacular of the various

 regions and only very seldom in Latin. These would mainly present a selection and

 a synthesis compared to the monumental and complex works of Pisano, but could

 also propose additions and elements of novelty. Very different in their appearance,
 content and size, those texts reach us in about three hundred codices and in various

 printed works. Their authors were mainly teachers, almost invariably abacus masters,

 but we know of some treatises written by simple lovers of mathematics, merchants,

 bookkeepers or artists. The subjects treated—even though they were not always all

 present and, however, developed at different levels—included an introduction to the

 positional numbering system, indigitation, operations with integers and fractions, the

 'regola del tre' and the 'falsa posizione' rules, mercantile arithmetic, practical geome

 try, algebra, number theory and theory of proportions; problems were often posed in the

 form of recreational mathematics. They were generally presented in a rhetorical way,

 sometimes using personal abbreviations and a particular algebraic symbolism. Some
 compilers would include a wide selections of works from various authors, individual

 problems proposed by and to other mathematicians, together with some interesting
 information on the history of the schools and on scholars and experts of abacus
 mathematics.3

 Five treatises of the abacus tradition, four handwritten and one printed, have been

 the main source of inspiration in the drafting of this article:

 The Trattato di praticha d'arismetricha included in the codex Palat. 573 (c. 1460)

 kept in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence and written by an anonymous Florentine

 disciple of the abacist Domenico di Agostino Cegia, best known as 'il Vaiaio'.

 2 The challenge to Maestro Giovanni di Bartolo

 An intriguing passage of the Arismetrica by Benedetto da Firenze, one of the most

 interesting abacists and abacus masters of the fifteenth century, reads:5

 Maestro Giovanni di Bartolo inchomincio a insegnare circha 1390 e, chosi chôme

 il suo maestro mon g[i]ovane, anchora lui g[i]ovane chominciô in questo modo.

 Morto il suo maestro Antonio, persuaso et aiutato da certi amici di Maestro Anto

 nio et anchora da' suoi, benché di 19 anni fusse, gli feciono aprire la medesima

 schuola et favoregiandolo quant' era possibile. Ε per sua g[i]ovaneza pocho dagli

 altri che 'nsegnavano conosciuto. Ε benché dottissimo et chopioso di libri fusse

 ... l'invidia che negli artefici d'un arte regnia e massime in fra quelli che inseg

 nono al presente, in fra lloro examinato in che modo si potesse levarlo di quella
 voluntà, presono questa via. Chonciosiachosaché per la sua età non fusse possi

 bile che egli potesse sapere, ragunorono, ciaschuno nella loro schuola, alchuni
 buoni ragioniere; e' fu nella schuola di Maestro Michele circha a 25 di varie
 materie, et nella schuola di Maestro Lucha circha altretanto, benché Maestro

 Luca pocho ο niente facesse, ma Maestro Biagio suo maestro .... Et chiamato
 ciaschuno a ssé dissono: a noi è stato detto che un fanc[i]ullotto discepolo di

 Maestro Antonio à riaperto la schuola ch'egli teneva quando era in vita; e, acciô

 che credo che fra voi sarebbe chi meglio di lui la terrebbe, io vi fo chomanda

 mento che ogi, quando venite alia schuola, vo' n'andiate là e pigliate le mute

 vostre da llui et quando vi fate insegnare mostrategli cho' vostri arghomenti

 che sapete, che vadi a ffare altro. A' quali ubidendo i detti discepoli andorono

 .... Maestro Giovanni, maravigliatosi di tanti et quali ... et di diverse materie,

 subito stimô quel ch'era. Nientedimeno, a uno a uno chiamatogli, la materia loro

 che volevano mostro ... et chiari loro in modo che stupefatti ... parve loro, in

 quello pocho di spazio, avere più inparato che Ί resto del tempo agli altri; onde

 seguitando pervennono in modo che molti di loro furono per lo' propia voluntà

 sopinti a dire et fare villania a' loro maestri primi, solamente avendo chonpreso

 la intensa invidia che gli portavono ....6

 Various archival documents on the activity of the Florentine masters suggest that the

 episode narrated by Benedetto be dated to around 1388-1389, when in fact Giovanni

 di Bartolo was still very young, about twenty-four years old. It was more than two

 years after the prestigious "Scuola di Santa Trinita", at that time situated in front of

 the church bearing the same name, had lost its most significant exponent, the skilled

 algebraist Antonio Mazzinghi, who had died in his thirties. After a period of inactivity,

 the school had been reopened by Giovanni, the modest son of a mason and a former

 disciple of Maestro Antonio. Some teachers from other schools of the town, all older

 than Giovanni and eager to take Mazzinghi's place as headmaster of the "Scuola di

 Santa Trinita", set a trap for the young master, sending their best pupils to follow the

 "mute", namely the lessons held by Giovanni, in order to confuse him with complex

 questions "di diverse materie", which unfortunately we do not know and which the
 abacist unexpectedly answered in a clear and exhaustive way. His foes, who had

 deceitfully challenged Giovanni with the sole intention of discrediting him in the

 eyes of their students, were also skilful masters: they were Michele di Gianni, who

 was then teaching at the "Scuola dei Santi Apostoli", Biagio di Giovanni and Luca

 di Matteo, both teachers at the "Scuola del Lungarno", schools that were situated a

 stone's throw from that of Santa Trinita, and all located in the Neighbourhood of Santa

 Maria Novella. Giovanni di Bartolo, who was also lecturer of astrology in the Studio

 Fiorentino, taught in his abacus school for many years, until his death in 1440.7

 3 Giovanni di Bicci's questions and Massolo da Perugia's answers

 The anonymous Vaiaio's disciple talks in two circumstances of one Massolo, a.k.a.

 Petrozzo, da Perugia, "huomo assai esperto in dette scienzie", namely in mathematical
 sciences.

 6 "Maestro Giovanni di Bartolo began teaching around 1390. He was young, just like his teacher Antonio

 when he died. After his teacher's demise, although he was only 19, some of his and Antonio's friends helped
 him and convinced him to open the same school. Since he was young, although he was erudite and owned

 many books, he was little known to the other teachers who, moved by the envy that reigns among those who

 perform the same activity, and most of all among those who are teaching at present, after discussing among

 themselves in which way they could discourage him from his intent, decided to proceed as follows. So,

 believing that, due to his age, Giovanni was not expert enough, each of them selected the best students from

 his school: about 25 from Maestro Michele's school, expert in various subjects, and almost as many from

 the school where Maestro Luca taught, although very little, and most of all his teacher, Maestro Biagio,

 taught. They said to each of them: it came to our knowledge that a young disciple of Maestro Antonio's has

 reopened the school that he had when he was alive, and since we think that among you there is someone

 better than him, today you shall go follow his lessons, showing him your ability, so that he will decide to

 do something else. Obedient to such orders, those disciples went to the school of Maestro Giovanni who

 was surprised but immediately understood the reason for so many students. However, calling them one by

 one, he explained to all of them the subject they requested, and he did it so well that in that short time they

 felt they had learned much more than they had so far from the other teachers; and many of them ended up

 by bad-mouthing their first teachers, since they understood the deep envy they felt for him".

 In the tenth part of the Arismetricha contained in Palat. 573, dedicated to algebra,

 he narrates that around 1397 Massolo sent a letter to Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici,

 in response to some questions he had posed on the solution of equations.8 The text of

 the letter was also the copy of a reply to another letter that the Perugino had received

 from a certain Maestro Diamante, who taught in Venice in 1396, and begins like this:

 Chonprendo vi paia gran fatto che cubi, censi et chose si possono aguagliare al

 numéro, chonsiderato l'opinione di tutti e' passati è suta non essere possibile;

 io ve dicho che onne adeguagliamento è possibile a definire et, se Ί modo non

 fusse molto lungho et dificile, in questa ve Ί manderia; bene che, quello nne
 richiedete, vi mando.9

 It is unclear whether the Umbrian mathematician knew formulas for solving third

 degree equations, and if so, which of them;10 from what he writes later, it seems that

 he wished to refer to the possibility of constructing any typology of algebraic equation

 by assuming that it has a given root. So, for instance, "la radice chubica dello 84, chollo

 abattimento di 5 chose, è 4; perché 5 chose sono 20 che, abattutte del'84, rimanghono
 64, la chui radicie chubicha è 4".11 Since in those times the 'cosa' meant the variable

 x, it means that a solution of the equation 84 - 5* = x3 is χ = 4.

 We find another reference to Massolo in the introduction to the vernacular version

 of Fibonacci's Liber quadratorum, which is part of Palat. 577.12 Here we can read that,

 on an unspecified date, the Perugino sent nothing less than a "treatise" containing "10

 ragioni a Giovanni de' Bicci de' Medici, le quali, il detto Giovanni, per lo tempo pas

 sato, gli aveva chieste per darle ad alchuni valenti che erano a quel tempo dimostratori,

 cioè tenevano in questa città schuola".13 Those problems concerned square numbers

 and, as the author of Palat. 577 pointed out, "Nientedimeno Lionardo Pisano chiaro
 dimostra e' numeri quadrati avere certe nature per le quali l'asolutione delle quistioni

 sopra quelle trovate prestamente s'ànno".14 One in particular contained the answer to

 8 Arrighi 1967a, 401^02; Arrighi 2004,165-166.

 9 "1 understand that to you it seems a great fact that cubi, censi and cose can be equalised to the number,

 since in the past everybody thought it impossible; I am telling you that every equalisation can be defined

 and, if the procedure wasn't very long and difficult, 1 would explain it to you in this letter; however, I am

 sending you what you have requested".

 10 In the fourteenth century, four treatises were known reporting formulas for the solution of third-degree

 equations that were completely wrong: Paolo Gherardi's Libro di ragioni, written in Montpellier (1328:

 BNF, Magi. XI, 87), the anonymous Trattato dell'alcibra amuchabile (c. 1365: BRF, Ricc. 2263), the treatise
 Aritmetica e geometria by Gilio da Siena (1384: BCS, L.IX.28), the anonymous Libro merchatantesche
 (1398: BCP, 2QqE13). The Aliabraa argibra, written in Pisa by some Maestro Dardi in 1344, found in
 different codices, and the aforementioned Libro merchatantesche propose formulas for complete third- and

 fourth-degree equations that are exact, but only within specific problems. The same formulas can be found

 in many texts of the fifteenth century. On this subject, see Franci 2013.

 11 "The cube root of 84, decreased by 5 cose, is 4; because 5 cose are 20 that, subtracted from 84, gives
 64, whose cubic root is 4".

 12 Arrighi 1967c, 774; Arrighi 2004, 208.

 13 "Ten problems to Giovanni de' Bicci de' Medici that said Giovanni sent to him in the past to pass them

 on to some expert mathematicians, who at that time had schools in this city".

 14 "No less Lionardo Pisano clearly demonstrates that square numbers have certain properties, by which

 one can immediately find the solutions to the questions asked on them".

 the question: "trovare uno numéro quadrato che agunto, ο vero trattone, uno numéro

 rimangha quadrato".15

 It is the well-known problem that translates into two undetermined equations

 x2 + N = y2

 x2 - Ν = ζ2

 where the numbers Ν and x2, integer or rational, are called congruous and congruent,

 respectively.

 The question, already present in Diophantus's Aritmetica and in some works written

 by Arab mathematicians of the tenth to eleventh century, is one of the more complex

 among those tackled by Fibonacci.

 Moving from the question posed to him by Giovanni da Palermo with Ν = 5,

 Pisano dealt with the problem more generally in the Liber quadratorum and then in

 the Flos for that specific case only. The version of the Book of Squares included in
 Palat. 577 and also another vernacular version of Leonardo's treatise that Benedetto

 da Firenze included in the Arismetrica of codex L.IV.21 contain significant original

 contributions to the solution of the congruous-congruent numbers problem.16

 Besides the mathematical aspects, the interest of the tales reported in the codices

 Palat. 573 and Palat. 577 on Massolo consists firstly in the fact that the questions

 were posed to him by a figure of primary importance in the history of Florence,
 Giovanni de' Medici, son of Averardo, called Bicci, and father to Cosimo il Vecchio.

 Precisely in 1397, the year in which he received Perugino's answer on the equations,

 Giovanni moved the headquarters of the Bank of Rome that he had shared with his

 uncle Vieri to Florence, triggering the quick economic and political rise of the Medici

 family. The Vaiaio's anonymous disciple reports that Giovanni, undoubtedly trained

 in an abacus school, and a keen promoter of works of art and architecture, also had
 mathematical interests and close relations with the best teachers of the Florentine

 schools; he probably met the Umbrian mathematician in person.

 A significant note concerns Massolo himself, about whom we have no biographical

 information, although we can suppose he was one of the abacus masters whose public
 activity with the Studio di Perugia is known from 1389:17 we cannot rule out that

 he is the "magister geometricus" mentioned in the Statutes of the Conservator! della
 Moneta dated 1396.18

 15 "Find a square number such that, whether you add or subtract a number, remains a square number".

 16 See Franci 1984.

 17 Cf. Ermini 1971,185; Ulivi 2002b, 125-126.

 18 Two more questions included in Palat. 573 and in L.IV.21 concern abacus masters from out of Florence

 and their relations with Florentine abacus schools. The two problems, both solved algebraically, have no

 particular mathematical significance; therefore, we will provide only some notes of a historical nature. The
 manuscript Palatino's problem was posed by Filippo de' Folli da Pisa to Maestro Giovanni di Bartolo in

 1399 (Arrighi 1967a, 404; Airighi 2004,166-167). This problem is the only problem we know by Maestro

 Filippo. The Folli, from an illustrious family from Pisa, taught at least in 1398-1399, cooperating with his

 junior Iacopo di Maestro Tommaso, one of the five abacists active in Pisa in the fourteenth century who
 belonged to the lineage of the Bonagi dell'Abaco, perhaps the same of Fibonacci's (Ulivi 2011, 258-271).

 The question of the manuscript L.IV.21 was sent to Florence by a master from L'Aquila in 1445, even if

 4 Marco Trevigiano's question

 In 1372, one Marco Trevigiano sent an interesting question to the Florentine masters.

 Perhaps this Marco, supposedly originally from Treviso, was an abacus master in

 that town, where, however, we know nothing about the teaching of the abacus that,

 conversely, is documented in nearby Venice from the early fourteenth century, nearly

 always in private schools.19 The question can be placed in recreational mathematics. It

 concerned the Earth's circumference, of which it reported the measure, in Arab miles,

 obtained by the Arab astronomer al-Farghani, a.k.a. Alfraganus, who lived in the first

 half of the ninth century at the time of the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun, a measure

 that also Dante mentions in the Convivio (Cv. Ill, V, 11). It also required knowledge
 of the formula from the sum of the first η natural numbers and that of their cubes.

 For this reason right in the second chapter of the fifth part of the Trattato di praticha

 d'arismetricha of Palat. 573, "dove s'asolve chasi per natura e propietà di numeri",

 Vaiaio's anonymous disciple proposed that problem:20

 Credesi, per gli astrologhi, la Terra girare 20400; dove adunque 2 huomini si

 partono, et l'uno va inverso levante et l'altro inverso ponente, et muovonsi da

 uno punto solamente. Et l'uno va, il primo dî un miglio, e il sechondo 2 miglia,

 e il terzo dî 3 miglia, e chosî ogni dî il primo va più un miglio che Ί dî passato.

 Ε il sechondo huomo va, il primo dî uno miglio, il sechondo di 8 miglia, et chosî

 ogni dî va il seguente numéro chubo, cioè il terzo dî 27 miglia et il quarto dî

 64 miglia. Adimandasi in quanti dî si schonterranno insieme. Questa quistione

 mandô a Ffirenze Marcho trevigiano nel 1372. E, benché varii oppinioni sieno,

 io tengho questo ....21

 symbolism, is the following:

 then

 The solution, described in the usual rhetorical language, and here presented in our

 Footnote 18 continued

 it is included by Benedetto da Firenze in the "chasi exenplari alia regola dell'algebra di Maestro Biagio";
 said Biagio, called "il vecchio", had died around 1340, after being master and collaborator of the renowned

 Paolo dell'Abaco, probably in the "Bottega di Santa Trinita" (Arrighi 1965, 377; Arrighi 2004, 136; M°
 Biagio 1983, 116-119). As of today, the problem of the anonymous master from L'Aquila is the only

 statement that provides evidence of the existence of abacus schools in the capital city of Abruzzo, at least

 in the mid-fifteenth century.

 21 "Astrologists believe that the Earth has a circumference of 20400. Where two men start from the same

 point, and one goes east, while the other goes west. And on the first day, one travels one mile, the second

 day 2 miles, and the third day 3 miles, and so every day the first man has travelled one mile more than the

 previous day. And the second man travels one mile on the first day, 8 miles on the second, and so every day

 he travels the next cube number, that is 27 miles on the third day and 64 miles on the fourth. The question is:

 in how many days will they meet? Marco Trevigiano sent this question to Florence in 1372. And, although
 there are various methods, I follow this one ..."

 He observed that P( 16) = 18632 and P(17) = 23561; therefore, η = 16 + /

 „ 20400 -P(16) 1768 , ^ 1768
 f = = whence η = 16 Η
 J P(17)-P(16) 4930 4930

 This problem has been discussed many times by historians, not in relation to Marco

 Trevigiano's question included in Palat. 573 but to three important mathematicians

 of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, namely Luca Pacioli, Girolamo Cardano and

 Niccolô Tartaglia, who reported it in three of their works, which can be included,

 despite at a very high level, in the body of abacus treatises.22

 Pacioli, a Franciscan Mar born in Borgo Sansepolcro, proposed it in the first part

 of the Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni et proportionalita, published in

 1494. His solution is based on the algebraic method.23 He writes:

 Fa cosî, poni che li si congionga in 1 co. de di, adonca serà andato lo

 primo in questo tempo \ce.e\co. Ε lo secondo sirà andato in questo tempo

 jce.ce.e ^cu.e ^ce.

 24

 Therefore, it takes as variable χ = 1 cosa, the number of days to be determined.25

 With the previous notation, since

 1 9 1

 Pl(x) = 2 +2X

 1 δ li It

 P2CO = 7* + -x + -χ

 4 2 4

 by summing, he gets

 1 4 1 , 3 7 1
 -λ4 + —x + -x2 + -x = 20400
 4 2 4 2

 23 Summa, I: distinctio secunda, tractatus quintus, 38r and 44r.

 24 "Do as I say; assume that they meet in a number of days equal to 1 co:, hence, in such time, the first

 would have travelled jce. and jco. And in that time, the second would have travelled \ce.ce. and jcm.

 and \ce...."

 Many years later, both the mathematician Pavese Cardano in the last chapter of its

 Practica arithmetice of 1539, entitled "De erroribus Fratris Luce", and Tartaglia in

 the Second Part of the General trattato di numeri et misure, published in 1556, and still

 among the "Errori" of the friar from Borgo Sansepolcro, highlighted the incorrectness

 of Pacioli's algebraic method; indeed, this would have led to an irrational result, while

 the very procedure of the solution assumed it to be a natural number. Therefore,

 they both proposed an alternative solution by interpolation, already described in the

 codex Palat. 573, which leads anyway to a non-integer result. In the Sixth Part of the

 General trattato, published posthumously in 1560, Tartaglia re-proposed the problem

 in algebraic form, but replaced the value 20400 with 29412 so as to obtain the equation

 {x2 + x + \)2 = 117649

 whose solution is χ = 18.26

 Pacioli, Cardano and Tartaglia made no reference whatsoever to the far more ancient

 origins of the question, which, however, must have been subject of discussions in the

 Italian abacus schools for quite a while, also judging from the allusion to the knowledge

 of "varii oppinioni" on the subject made by the author of the palatine manuscript written
 around 1460.

 The mathematician from Borgo Sansepolcro, in addition to holding various posi

 tions as a lecturer of mathematics at university level, received various assignments as

 an abacus master in the Studio di Perugia. Tartaglia had been abacus master at least

 in the schools of Verona and then public lecturer in Venice and Brescia.

 As for Cardano, we know that he taught mathematics in Milan in the Scuole Piattine,

 but we have no accurate information about what he taught. However, various consid
 erations lead us to assume that he had contacts with the abacus schools. There are

 26 The German mathematician Michael Stifel, in his Arithmetica intégra of 1544 (306r-307v), re-examining

 the problem from Cardano's work, solved it algebraically, like Pacioli and Tartaglia, but with 44310 instead

 of20400 so as to obtain the solution χ = 20. Soon after, observing that Pi(x) is the square of P\ (λ), without

 developing the two expressions, solved the P\ (x) + Ρϊ(χ) = 44310 by changing the variable (x2 + x)/2 =

 y, thus avoiding the fourth-degree equation and finding χ through two second-degree equations.

 significant and repeated references in his works to a certain Gabriele Aratori or degli

 Aratori da Caravaggio "arithmeticus optimus", whom Cardano recalls as "arithmeti

 cam Mediolani publice docente" and for whom he also prepared a horoscope, knowing
 his exact date of birth, 31 December 1480. This connection offers us the chance to

 report an interesting hypothesis about the Aratori discussed by art historians. Accord

 ing to Calvesi, that Gabriele Aratori could be a forefather of Michelangelo Merisi, "il

 Caravaggio", whose mother was Lucia di Giovan Giacomo Aratori.27 Considering the

 mathematical interests of the Aratori cited by Cardano, we believe that this hypothesis

 is supported by a document of 1525 in which one Gabriele of Luigi Aratori appears

 as witness of a notary deed of Giovan Antonio di Stefano Aratori who, according

 to Berra, can be reasonably considered the maternal great-grandfather of Caravaggio,

 and by other various documents in which the maternal grandfather of the great painter,

 Giovan Giacomo, is identified as "agrimensore",28 that is, as a surveyor who had to

 measure real estate properties, an activity that required mathematical competence and

 for a long time had been carried out by expert abacists, often by actual abacus masters.

 5 A question posed by Giovanni del Sodo

 Luca Pacioli received his first assignments as an abacus master from the University

 of Perugia between 1477 and 1480. In those years, he composed his second abacus

 treatise,29 dedicated to his students, the Tractatus mathematicus ad discipulos perusi

 nos. The work is divided into sixteen parts followed by a "Tariffa mercantesca" that

 precedes the last group of mathematical problems. The "Capituli de algebra" occupy

 the sixteenth part, albeit incomplete due to the absence of the first twenty-five papers,

 where we assume that Pacioli had also described the peculiar algebraic symbolism that

 he used in his treatise and that we can reconstruct by reading his problems. Towards

 the end of the chapters on algebra and among the problems following the "Tariffa",

 Pacioli reported four questions pointing out, or writing notes in the margin, that he

 had sent the solutions to Florence. In one, reported below, he explicitly mentioned the

 name of the master who proposed it to him in 1480, Giovanni del Sodo dei Sodi;30

 Frate Luca had also sent questions to the Florentine master, but without getting any

 reply, at least until then:

 Trovame 3 numeri proportionali ch' el quadrato del terzo sie uguale a la summa

 di quadrati degli altri doi, e multiplichare el primo numéro nel secondo facia 10;

 dimando che fia ciascun numéro per sé. Sapi questa esser bona domanda, e a di

 27 Calvesi 1992,18-19; Calvesi 2000,40.

 28 Cf. Berra 2005, 125-133, 342. Oddly, it is precisely Berra, in producing these documents and only
 three more notary deeds where some Gabriele Aratori is mentioned, who believes "invece evidente" that

 the Gabriele mentioned by Cardano "non fosse in alcun modo parente del nonno materno del Caravaggio

 perché il suo nome non compare mai, neppure marginal mente, associato a quello dei familiari del pittore".

 29 The first, gone missing, dates back to 1470 and was dedicated to the children of the merchant Antonio

 Rompiasi, of whom Luca was the tutor during his first stay in Venice.

 Indicating by a, b, c the quantities to be determined, which are assumed to be in

 continued proportion, the problem translates, using the modern symbolism, into the
 relations

 The same problem is solved by Leonardo Pisano in the fifteenth chapter of the Liber
 abaci?2 Like Fibonacci, Pacioli assumed as variable a — x.

 From the first and third equation, he obtained b = ψ and c = and finally,

 ■ · ^

 a : b — b : c

 a2 + b2 = c2

 ab = 10

 2 100 10000
 x Η γ — —7—

 X2 xè

 and then

 χ10 + ΙΟΟχ6 = ΙΟΟΟΟχ2

 χ9 + lOOx5 = lOOOOx

 *8 + lOOx4 = 10000

 Again, as in the Liber abaci, where, however, the deduction of the last equation is more

 immediate, the solution is obtained by reducing the eight-degree trinomial equation

 to one of second degree in the variable x4.

 The problem is quite significant because in the entire Tractatus it is the one with

 the equations of highest degree, allowing us to identify the symbols used by Pacioli

 for the variable and the ensuing powers up to the tenth, with the sole exclusion of the
 seventh.

 The previous three equations read, respectively

 100più 1D<2> equalea 10000°

 1OO0 piu 1AA equate a 10000co

 100DD più l000 equate a 10000

 31 "Find 3 proportional numbers so that the square of the third is equal to the sum of the squares of the

 other two, and if you multiply the first number by the second the result is 10; I am asking what the value

 of each number is. Mind you, this is a good question sent to me on the 4th April 1480 from Florence by

 Maestro Giovanni Sodi at the hand of Giovan Giacomo, goldsmith in Perugia, and we gave him a very exact

 answer, and to other questions too, and then we sent him, in our turn, other questions that so far have not
 been answered, etc.".

 663

 So, Pacioli used the basic symbols co, □, Δ, 0 to indicate the first, second, third and

 fifth power of the variable. The other powers are obtained by arranging those symbols

 according to the multiplication principle.33

 Although with some adjustments, the Tractatus ad discipulos perusinos was used

 almost entirely by Pacioli in the realisation of his bigger, almost monumental, printed

 work, the Summa, without using in it algebraic symbolism of the Tractatus, but instead

 more rhetorical and traditional notations. As we have already seen in the previous ques
 tion of Marco Trevigiano: 1 co.( 1 cosa) = χ, 1 ce.{ 1 censo) = χ2,1 c«.(l cubo) =
 χ3,1 ce.ce.(l censo di censo) = x4; moreover, 1 p°.r°.(l primo relato) = x5, and so
 on.

 In particular, the problem proposed by Giovanni dei Sodi, but without any reference

 to the Florentine mathematician, appears in the first part of the Summa, among those

 on numbers in continued proportion.34 So, for instance, the previous equation of tenth

 degree is written in the form: 10000 ce. equali a 100 ce.cu. p. 1 ce.p°.r°.

 Some treatises of the fifteenth and sixteenth century have points in common with

 the peculiar symbolism of the Tractatus.

 The observation appears almost obvious when comparing Pacioli's text to the Trat

 tato d'abaco by Piero della Francesca, written in the seventies of the fifteenth century.

 In Piero's book, Luca's illustrious friend and fellow citizen, here too in an irregular

 way and with the coexistence of abbreviations in rhetorical style, we find the same

 symbols used by Pacioli for the second, third and fourth power of the variable, placed

 above the relevant coefficient; the variable is identified by a dash placed on the rele

 vant coefficient, and the triangle that identifies the third power is often replaced by a

 c, initial of cube.35

 Far more evident, although apparently undetected until today, is the correspondence

 between the Tractatus symbolism and the symbolism described in some short "Capitoli
 d'arcibra" situated at the end of the Florentine codex Ash. 353 in the Biblioteca

 Medicea Laurenziana, a codex that Van Egmond has dated around 1470 based on the

 filigree analysis.36

 In a table of this codex, we find the notations used by Maestro Luca up to the sixth

 and for the eighth power,37 with a symbol also for the seventh power of the variable,

 the "sechondo relato", a small circle cut by two diameters (Fig. 1), maybe even present

 in one of the lost pages of Pacioli's manuscript.

 33 Actually, in the manuscript, the author proceeds in a rather erratic way, placing them as exponents or
 above the relevant coefficient.

 34 Summa, I: distinctio sexta, tractates sextus, 93r.

 35 Piero della Francesca 2012,1, Testo e note, XIX, L-LI. We notice that in the vernacular version of Piero

 della Francesca's Libellus quinque corporum regularium, which is part of the Divina proportione, published

 in 1509, Pacioli again used a symbolic notation limited to the first, second and fourth power, but different

 from both that of the Tractatus and that used by Piero in the original text: cf. Piero della Francesca 1995,1,

 Testo e note, XXXII and XXXIV. At the end of the second part of the Summa, in the "Particularis tractatus

 circa corpora regularia et ordinaria", although taken from the geometrical part of Piero's Trattato d'abaco,

 Luca obviously follows the symbolism that is used in his entire text.

 36 The "Capitoli d'arcibra" occupy the folios 124r-127r of the manuscript and are preceded by a treatise

 by Matteo di Niccolô Cerretani, written with a different handwriting: cf. Van Egmond 1980, 78.

 We do not know who is the author of the "Capitoli" contained in the Laurentian

 manuscript, which seem to precede Pacioli's text some years. We know that that
 symbolism, already in the eighties, was known at least by Giovanni dei Sodi and
 probably by those attending his school. Giovanni, defined in a Book of Memories of

 the late fifteenth century as "el migliore maestro d' abacho da Firenze", taught for more
 than twenty years in the Neighbourhood of Santa Maria Novella. He had among his
 students Francesco Galigai and maybe even Raffaello Canacci, future abacus masters

 in the Neighbourhoods of San Giovanni and Santo Spirito.38 Both in the second edition
 of Canacci's Ragionamenti d'algebra (c. 1495), contained in the codex Palat. 567 of the
 Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence, and in Galigai's Summa de arithmetica, published
 in 1521, we find the same algebraic symbolism that Maestro Francesco says he took
 from an Arcibra, unknown to us, of his "preceptore" Giovanni del Sodo, which reaches

 the thirteenth power of the variable. Perhaps Giovanni, drawing inspiration from the

 problems he received from Pacioli, had created his personal symbolism that actually

 corresponds to that of the Tractatus only for the first, second and fourth power, while

 for the others he used a composition of squares and rectangles that in the written

 equation are situated on the right of the relevant coefficient.39

 6 Maestro Agnolo del Carmine's questions

 The question submitted by Giovanni dei Sodi to Luca Pacioli introduces us to an

 interesting subject in the abacus body of treatises, namely continued proportion, which

 is the subject of this final portion of our work.

 In abacus treatises, the problems, especially those relevant to mercantile arithmetic,

 are often solved by applying the 'regola del tre' and the 'falsa posizione' rules, which

 use proportionality, but they are mainly presented in an exclusively practical form,

 bypassing the concept of proportion. However, quite a few texts submit theoretical

 problems about proportional quantities, applying specific identities that characterise

 them. The best treatises, starting from the Liber abaci, also dedicate considerable

 space, sometimes even entire chapters, to the theory of proportions and to a systematic

 exposition of the relevant rules and properties with ensuing applications. This is the

 case with Pacioli, starting from the Tractatus ad discipulos perusinos, but mostly

 in the sixth distinction of the first part of the Summa, where he listed, among other

 things, thirteen "regole" and fifteen "chiavi" relevant to three, four or five quantities

 in continued proportion.40

 Francesco Galigai also dealt widely with this subject in his Summa de arithmetica,

 reporting in the third book a group of "casi sottili" posed to him by a certain Maestro

 Agnolo del Carmine "excessivo geometro, et le risposte da me factogli e absolutogli

 con regole et modi aptissimi, come apieno si vedra".41 There are six problems, one of

 which is repeated twice; they are solved with very little use of algebra, mainly through

 other methods and particular relations. We will present the three problems that we

 consider the most significant.

 The first question reads:

 Quando vvuoi dividere 11 in tre parte continue proportionali, per sapere ciascuna

 parte per sé. Questa mi propose Maestro Agnolo dal Carmine non mi dicendo

 in che proportione se la volessi, la composi nella doppia proportione.42

 It is an undetermined problem to which Galigai found a solution using the simple

 'falsa posizione'. After calling the three parts a, b and c, he assumed they are 1,2 and

 4, respectively, whose sum is 7; then, he obtained a from the proportion

 39 Summa de arithmetica, 71r-71v. Cf. Franci and Toti Rigatelli 1985,68.

 40 Summa, I: distinctio sexta, tractatus sextus, 86v-89v.

 41 Summa de arithmetica, 22r, 25r-27r.

 42 "When you wish to divide 11 in three continued proportional parts, find each part. This is the question

 that Maestro Agnolo dal Carmine posed to me, without telling me in which proportion he wanted it; I solved
 it in the double proportion".

 1:7 = α: 11 hence a = —, b = —, c = —

 Taking 10 as number to be divided, Fibonacci had already solved the problem using

 the same method in the third paragraph of the twelfth chapter of the Liber abaci41* ;

 then we find it, for instance, in the twelfth part of Luca Pacioli's Tractatus, with the

 title "Divisioni e partimenti di numeri".44

 Agnolo del Carmine's second and fourth questions differ only in the numerical

 data. The first formulation is the following:

 Fammi di 14 tre parte continue proportionali che multiplicato ciascuna contro
 all'altre 2, et gli avvenimenti giunti insieme faccino 112; domando le dette

 quantité.45

 In this case, it must follow that

 a + b + c = 14

 a.b = b:c

 a(b + c) + b(a + c) + c(b + d) = 112

 Galigai first obtained b using the identity:

 (*) 2(a + b + c)b — a{b + c) + b(a + c) + c(a + b) which is valid if b2 = ac,

 that is if the three quantities are, as in this case, in continued proportion.

 Thus, he found b = = 4.
 Then, he determined a = 2 and c = 8 from the conditions a + c = 10, ac = 16,

 like solutions of the equation χ2 — lOx + 16 = 0.

 Despite with different numerical data, this problem appeared various times
 in the abacus treatises from the fourteenth century. Antonio Mazzinghi solved
 it like Galigai in his Trattato di fioretti (c. 1370),46 work of which Benedetto
 da Firenze presented a wide selection in his Praticha d'arismetrica. Luca Paci
 oli did the same in his Summa, where the relation (*) constitutes its fourteenth

 "chiave".47 Other authors solved the problem only with algebra, like Maestro
 Giovanni di Bartolo in his "miracholose ragioni" reported in the codex Palat.
 573 48

 The third question posed by Maestro Agnolo is the following

 43 Leonardo Pisano 1857,1862,1,181; Giusti 2002,91.

 44 Cf. Pacioli 1996, 384-385 and 393. On the problems of chapter "Divisioni e partimenti di numeri" cf.
 Heeffer2010.

 45 "Divide 14 in three continuously proportional parts so that, by multiplying each of them by the sum of

 the other two, the summed up products give 112; 1 am asking said quantities". In the second formulation

 the numbers 14 and 112 are replaced by 20 and 160 respectively.

 Truova 4 quantità continue proportionali che la somma della prima e quarta sia

 Thus, it must be

 a:b = b\c = c:d

 a -\- d ■= 18

 b + c =12

 Here Galigai used the identity

 (b + c)3 9 9
 be = — — valid because ac = b and bd = c

 3 (b + c) + (a + d)

 He then obtained b and c as solutions of the second-degree equation

 with the formula

 be = 3χ χ2+ί8 ~ Previ°us equation is λ2 - 12χ + 32 = 0; hence, b =

 4, c = 8, wherefïom a = 2, d = 16.

 Also in this case, the problem is solved in the same way in earlier abacus treatises.
 We find it with different numerical values in the codex Val. Lat. 4826 (c. 1450) that

 contains Iacopo da Firenze's Tractatus algorismi written in 1307, and in the work Una

 raccolta di ragioni by Filippo Calandri of the Sienese codex L.VI.45 (c. 1495).50 With
 the same data, it is included in Pacioli's Summa, where (**) constitutes the eleventh

 "regola" for calculating the second and third of four quantities in continued propor

 tion.51 Later Maestro Luca proposed another solution to the problem with different

 data and using a different property of the numbers in proportion.52 Another solution

 is described by an anonymous author in the codex Magi. XI. 120 (c. 1400) of the
 Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence.53

 As we said, when Francesco Galigai introduced the questions of Maestro Agnolo

 del Carmine in his book, he called him "excessivo geometro". And in other texts, the

 same master is described as an expert theologian and rich in mathematical competence,

 especially geometrical, with reference to the Florentine convent of Santa Maria del

 Carmine.54 Maestro Agnolo or Angelo, whose real name was Bicci, was indeed a friar

 of that convent. According to the cadastral data, he was born around 145655 from the

 old tanner Andrea di Antonio Catastini and his second wife Monna Andrea, daughter

 of Bicci di Lorenzo and sister of Neri di Bicci, renowned Florentine painters of the

 fifteenth century. In his interesting Ricordanze, an actual shop and family diary, Neri

 mentions his nephew many times. First, when his widowed sister, wearing rags and

 holding her child by the hand, was forced to seek refuge from her brother after her

 stepson excluded her from her dead husband's house; then, when Bicci, still very

 young, soon after her mother's second marriage with a notary, was sent to the friars of
 the convent Carmine, where he was consecrated and celebrated his first Mass in 1476.

 A few years later, he obtained a degree in theology, gave a lecture of logic in the Studio

 Fiorentino and became a provincial Padre for twenty years. He died on 7 July 1529.56

 In the inventory of his movable assets left at the convent, among his many books

 we find three works of astronomy, an edition of Euclide's Elementi and "Magister

 Lucas de Burgo Sancti Sepulcri geometria volgare", perhaps Pacioli's Summa or the

 transcription of only the geometrical part of the treatise.57 While there are no doubts

 about Frate Angelo's mathematical interests, as of today no document enables us to

 establish whether Catastini can be added to the already long list of those who taught
 the abacus in Florence.58
