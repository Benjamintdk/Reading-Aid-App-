 Abstract This paper investigates the methods of eclipse prediction in China before

 the fourth century AD, with a detailed example of the eclipse theory in the Jing chu li

 (Luminous Inception System 景初曆).As the official calendar of the Jin dynasty and the

 Kingdom Wei during the three kingdoms period, the Jing chu li was used for more than

 200years after it was adopted in 237 AD. From the San tong li (Triple Concordance

 System 三統曆）of the Western Han to the Jing chu li，methods for predicting eclipses

 developed in three important ways: (i) from predicting only lunar eclipses to the

 prediction of both solar and lunar eclipses; (ii) from relying only on the mean periods

 of the sun and the moon to taking into consideration the variation in lunar velocity; and

 (iii) from estimating only a rough date to predicting the exact time of eclipses. This

 paper addresses two questions: first, how did ancient Chinese astronomers use cycles

 to predict eclipses in the Han dynasty? Second, how did astronomers such as Liu Hong
 劉洪 and Yang Wei 楊偉 revise early eclipse prediction methods? The original text

 of the Jing chu li is analyzed to show how Yang Wei combined lunar velocity theory

 with the traditional method of predicting eclipses using cycles.

 1 Introduction

 Eclipse theory is one of the most important and difficult issues early Chinese

 astronomers faced in their astronomical and astrological practices. Eclipses held great

 astrological significance in ancient China. A change in the appearance of a heavenly

 body or variations in its motions held specific meanings in Chinese astrology. These

 meanings often related to politics. Unexpected or unpredicted astronomical phenom

 ena were seen as signals sent by heaven to the governors of the country. Eclipses,

 especially solar eclipses, were recognized as a warning to the emperor that his gover

 nance is not satisfactory.1 Not surprisingly, astronomers were asked to pay particular

 attention to the interpretation and prediction of eclipses. As an astronomical topic,

 the complexity of solar and lunar motions and other technical issues relating to the

 prediction of eclipses made them a crucial test of an astronomical system. This article

 investigates the development of eclipse theory in the Jing chu li (Luminous Inception

 System2), in particular the adoption of lunar velocity theory within eclipse theory. Two

 questions will be addressed: first, how did ancient Chinese astronomers use cycles to

 predict solar and lunar eclipses? Second, how did astronomers of the second and third

 century AD such as Liu Hong and Yang Wei revise early eclipse prediction methods

 up to the time of the official adoption of the Jing chu li in AD 237. The original text of

 the Jing chu li will be analyzed so as to show how Yang Wei combined lunar velocity

 theory with the traditional method of predicting eclipses using cycles.

 The texts of most Chinese li are recorded in the treatises of temperament and

 calendar 律曆志 in the dynastic histories. This tradition begins in the earliest dynastic

 history, the Shi ji (史記，the book of history, compiled by Sima Qian 司馬遷，？145

 BC-?86 BC) and is followed in subsequent histories including the Han shu (漢書，
 the book of the Han dynasty, compiled by Ban Gu 班固，32 AD-92 AD), the Hou

 Han shu (後漢書，the book of the Eastern Han dynasty, compiled by Fan Ye(范曄，

 398 AD-455 AD), the San guo zhi (三國志，the history of the three kingdoms period,
 compiled by Chen Shou 陳壽，233 AD-297 AD) and the Jin shu (晉書，the book

 of the Jin dynasty, compiled by Fang Xuanling 房玄齡，579 AD-648 AD).The Shi ji

 1 For more details on Chinese astrological divination, see Pankenier (2005), Sun (2000), and Loewe (1994).

 For translations of astrological treatises, see Ho Peng (1966) and Major (1993).

 2 I adopted the translations of the names of li from Sivin (2009). A list of Chinese li can be found in the

 section "Astronomical reforms" in the second chapter of the book. In the same section, as well as in his
 article "Mathematical astronomy and the Chinese calendar," in Sivin (2011), Sivin discussed the distinct

 meanings of the word li and explained why he uses "astronomical system" as the translation to the word li.

 The traditional translation "calendar" only represents the use of li as ephemerides in almanacs. However,
 other meanings include a system for predicting astronomical phenomena, a treatise on this system and a

 method of computing an ephemeris for the following year. In Sivin's view, simply using the word "calendar"

 as a translation of the Chinese li is partial and misleading. The difficulty in translating the Chinese word

 li lies in finding one English word corresponds to all these distinctive meanings. I therefore suggest using

 the word li as the English translation of Chinese li. This is similar to the use of the term zij directly in

 English as the translation of Islamic astronomical handbooks. Historians either straightforwardly call it zij

 in English context or use the word "table" as a representative. Similarly, I also call Chinese li "system" in

 short for "calendrical systems.’’ I adopted the term ‘‘system，’’ and I prefer "calendrical system" rather than

 "calendar" or "astronomical system” as the representative of the word li. "Calendrical system’’ is close to

 the literal meaning of the Chinese word li. Both "Astronomical system" and "Calendrical system” are clear

 enough to indicate the complexity, function, and the systematic structure of the Chinese li and show the most

 important similarity between Chinese, Islamic, and western theoretical astronomy in that they all attempt

 to study and make predictions of significant astronomical phenomena. I agree that the official systems are

 all astronomical systems. However, there are other systems in China that are astronomical systems but not

 related to the calendar. For example, the system in the Zhou bi suan jing is an astronomical system, but it

 is not a calendrical system and cannot be used as an official calendar. The structure of the system in the

 Zhou bi suan jing is unlike other Chinese official li. I also use the original Chinese word li in the name of a

 system rather than attempting to translate it. For example, I use Jing chu li rather than Jing chu system. In

 this article, I use calendar to refer to the Velocity Calendar.

 Eclipse theory in the Jing chu li

 contains an early form of a Chinese li, the Li shu jia zi pian 曆術甲子篇.Other early

 systems to be discussed here include the San tong li (Triple Concordance System，

 adopted in 104 BC) in the Han shu, the Si fen li (Quarter Remainder System 四分曆，

 adopted in 85 AD) in the Hou Han shu, the Qian xiang li (Supernal Emblem System

 乾象暦，adopted in 206 AD) and the Jing chu li (Luminous Inception System 景初曆，

 adopted in 237 AD) in the Jin shu and Song shu. These preserved works of calendrical

 astronomy preserve most of our evidence for early Chinese mathematical astronomy;

 nonofficial treatises such as the Zhou bi suan jing which deal with other aspects of

 mathematical astronomy，especially the mathematics of the gnomon, provide some

 additional information (Cullen 1996). Although other li from the Western Han to

 the Jin are mentioned in the histories, the texts of these systems themselves are not

 preserved. For example, Han Yi 辑翔 constructed the Huang chu li (Yellow Inception

 System 黃初曆）around the time of the Qian xiang li and Jing chu li but it was not

 officially adopted by any kingdom and no texts are preserved.

 All li have a similar structure. They always begin with a preface explaining why

 the system is built and how good it is. The second section is usually a list of con

 stants used in the calculation. This is followed by a series of procedures to calculate

 astronomical phenomena, including, for example in the Jing chu li，solar theory, lunar

 theory, intercalation, eclipse theory, and planetary theory. Earlier systems sometimes

 have fewer sections and simpler methods but their structure and, more importantly,

 the function of the systems are similar.

 2 The adoption of the Jing chu li

 There are a total of around fifty li officially adopted in China. The procedure by which

 a new system is adopted is the same throughout most of Chinese history: the emperor

 orders for a new li to replace the existing one. Officials in the astronomical bureau

 will follow the call and work on the new system. After testing the system against
 astronomical observations, the system will be submitted and accepted. However, the

 astrological significance and the astronomical complexity of eclipses complicate the

 replacement of li (Niu 2004). According to Sivin, four situations could happen. First,

 the officials do their work well and produce an exceptional system. Second, the new

 system does not have improvement on the existing one. Third, the new system is not

 adopted, even though it is better than the existing one. Fourth, it is also possible that an

 astronomer, usually an official, develops new theories and realizes the current system

 is not accurate enough; the ability to predict astronomical phenomena is limited. He

 presents and succeeds in persuading the emperor and other officials to adopt the new

 li and replace the old one (Sivin 2011).

 The adoption of the Jing chu li belongs to the fourth circumstance. When the system

 being used is not accurate enough, Yang Wei presented his system and claimed that his

 system was better than any other ones. The circumstances surrounding the adoption of

 the Jing chu li is discussed in several early dynastic histories, including the Hou Han

 shu, the Jin shu, and the Song shu. The report from the Song shu is both clear and brief:

 During the Era of Guang He (光和’ Glorious Harmony,178 AD to 184 AD, the

 third reign period used by the Ling 靈 emperor in the Eastern Han), the Observer

 of the Gucheng Gate 穀城門候 3 Liu Hong was the first to realize that the Si fen

 li is off the heavenly motions. He built the method of Qian xiang with 589 as

 Era divisor and 145 as Dou Fraction (the fraction of the Lodge dou). He built the

 Velocity Calendar (Chi ji li 遲疾曆）to project the lunar motion. It is similar to

 the Tai chu li and the Si fen li，while finer and more accurate. During the Era of

 Huang chu (黃初，220 A.D. to 226 A.D., the first reign period used by the Wei

 kingdom) of the Wen 文 emperor in the Wei, the Assistant Grand Astronomer

 太史丞 Han Yi believed the Qian xiang li cut down the Dou Fraction too much,

 and it will be ahead of the heavenly motions as time goes on. He built the Huang
 chu li with 4883 as Era divisor and 1205 as Dou Fraction. Later, the Prefect of the

 Masters of Writing 尚書令 Chen Qun 陳群 presented a memorial, which said,

 “it is difficult to get a clear understanding on the li and the numbers. Scholars

 from earlier dynasties argued a lot. The inauguration of the Huang chu li is

 because the Si fen li is aged and inaccurate. The mandate has come to Wei, it

 is a good time to correct the li and ascertain the seasons. Han Yi first built the

 Huang chu li，he was afraid it was not accurate and used the Qian xiang li to

 compare and adjust. During three years, even more opinions were brought up

 on right or wrong. (They) neglect the essential (issues) and concern the minor

 ones. To argue on the size, (they) question the measures. This took a long time,

 and there is no result. According to the yi-debate by the three high officials (san

 gong 三公，three high officials who are responsible for important affairs), both

 (systems) synthesize and explicitly made arguments, they are heading to one

 place from different roads. It is better to let them use instruments, to practice

 their theories. In the time of one year, the advantages and disadvantages will

 certainly be judged. The matters will be agreed." (The emperor) agreed. During

 the Era of the Ming 明 emperor, Gentleman of the Masters of Writing 尚書郎

 Yang Wei built the Jing chu li，it has been used through the Jin and the Song.

 character 候 for an observer who keeps watching sky rather than a captain of a guard team.

 Eclipse theory in the Jing chu li 107

 This passage reviews the development of li from the end of the eastern Han dynasty

 to the establishment of the Jin dynasty. During the Era of Guang He, Liu Hong devel

 oped his system Qian xiang li.5 In the first year of Huang Chu of the Wen emperor in

 the Wei, the Assistant Grand Astrologer Han Yi built the Huang chu li. This system

 is named after the new reign period Huang Chu. It is not preserved in any dynastic

 histories or other textual source and was not officially used in any kingdom in the

 three kingdoms period either. At that time, the kingdom of Shu 蜀 adopted the Si fen

 li from the Eastern Han and the kingdom of Wu 吳 used Liu Hong's Qian xiang li as

 its official system. The kingdom of Wei is the strongest power at the time but had not

 officially adopted a new system to replace the Si fen li. Officials such as Chen Qun

 argued that the kingdom needs a new li since "the mandate has come to Wei, it is a

 good time to correct the li and ascertain seasons." At the time that Chen Qun wrote,

 the Huang chu li and Qian xiang li had already been discussed for three years but no

 conclusion had been reached when comparing the two systems. Chen Qun argued in

 favor of stopping the theoretical discussion and making predictions with both systems

 that could then be compared with observations. The Jin shu recorded the results of

 this competition

 Among the predictions of five solar and lunar eclipses, the Qian xiang has four

 further, the Huang chu has one closer.6

 凡課日月蝕五事，《乾象》四遠，《黃初》一近。

 Among fifteen appearances and disappearances of four planets, Qian xiang made

 seven closer and two correct, Huang chu has five closer and one correct.

 凡四星見伏十五；《乾象》七近ニ中，《黃初》五近一中。

 (Li 1974).

 One way to know which system is better, Huang chu li or Qian xiang li，is to see

 which system makes better predictions according to the observations of the astro

 nomical phenomena, for example, eclipses, in the coming yearノ Morgan (2013) has
 discussed the Huang chu debate and observation tests in detail. Here, the results of

 the eclipse predictions are divided into two groups, closer (jin 近）and further (yuan

 遠)，depending on which prediction is more accurate. The Qian xiang exceeds the

 Huang chu four times and Huang chu has one prediction closer to the observation.

 The results of the planetary phenomena predictions are divided into two groups, cor

 rect and closer. The other predictions by the Qian xiang li and the Huang chu li are

 not brought up in the text, but these should be just further or be regarded as missed

 5 According to He Chengtian 何承天，the author of the Yuan jia li in 443 AD, Liu Hong, produced the

 Qian xiang li between 178 AD to 184 AD. According to Chen (1986), Liu Hong first developed a draft of

 the Qian xiang li few years after 184 AD, and after testing against observations for more than 10 years, he

 finally finished the system in 206 AD.

 6 The preserved text says "Qian xiang has four further". But according to the results of the tests, Qian
 xiang has four closer. See Morgan (2013).

 7 Eclipses were often seen to be the crucial test of a system. For example, in the (much later) Song
 (1976), treatise of calendar 元史•曆志、we read "the accuracy of li is checked when eclipses happen
 暦法疏密，驗在交食. 、

 than the ones which are correct and closer. The number of the other predictions can be

 easily deduced using simple arithmetic. In the planetary predictions, the Qian xiang
 missed six times and was closer to the observation seven times. The text claims that

 the Qian xiang li successfully predicted the planetary phenomena twice, although it

 does not say how accurate the prediction needs to be considered as successful. On

 the other side, the Huang chu li missed nine times and was closer five times. It also

 has one successful prediction. Considering both the eclipse and planetary predictions,

 both systems have correct and missed predictions. The Qiang xiang li took a little

 advantage over the Huang chu li，but the lead is limited. At the same time, the number

 of missing predictions was a hint that new methods still need to be studied; a new

 li still needed to be built. In the first year of the Jing Chu of the emperor Ming 明，

 Yang Wei built the Jing chu li. In the preface of the Jing Chu li, Yang Wei claimed his

 system is better than any previous systems:

 The Jing chu li I built uses brief and accurate methods and precise numbers.

 It is accurate to implement and use, efficient to regulate, and easy to learn.

 Even if we again ask Yan and Sang to mentally calculate, Li shou to operate

 using chou, Zhong and Li to observe with gnomon, Xi and He to measure the

 shadow.8 Even ask them to observe the heavenly motion, predict and verify the

 motions of the sun and the moon to a highly accurate extent and to the extreme

 of the calculations. However, all of these are not as good as mine. As a result,

 the systems and the numbers all became inaccurate after dynasties. From the

 Yellow Emperor on, it has been frequently reformed with no stop.

 臣之所建《景初暦》，法數則約要，施用則近密，治之則省功，學之則易知。雖

 複使研桑心算，隸首運籌，重黎司晷，羲和察景，以考天路，步驗日月，究極精微，

 盡術數之極者，皆未能並臣如此之妙也。是以累代曆數，皆疏而不密，自黃帝以来，

 常改革不已。

 (Li 1974).

 Before 237 AD, there had been considerable discussion over the ofncial system in

 the kingdom of Wei, but the Si fen li was able to keep its official status because of

 the lack of clarity over what system was better. This situation finally changed when

 Emperor Ming decided to adopt the Jing chu li as the official system. The Jing chu li

 continued to be the official system in the Wei, Jin, Song, and Northern Wei for more

 than two hundred years (237 AD-443 AD).

 3 The use of cycles in eclipse prediction before the Jing chu li

 Visible planetary and lunar motions appear repeatedly with their own periods. Ancient

 Chinese scholars use time intervals as the units in calculating with these cycles in their

 li. In the Jin chu li，Yang Wei uses six units: the Yuan, Era, Rule, year, month, and

 day. In order to simplify calculation between different cycles, terms with the name
 “divisor” such as the Day Divisor (Ri fa 日法)，the Rule Divisor (zhang fa 章法)，
 the Era Divisor (Ji fa 紀法)，and the Yuan Divisor (Yuan fa 元法）are used as the

 denominators in fractions. After a certain period, usually a periodic cycle, the fraction

 disappears and we are left with an integer. For example, the length of â tropical year

 in the Jing chu li is 365 455/1843 days, where 1843 is known as the Era Divisor. One
 Era has 1843 years, which is a total of 673150 (365 x 1843 + 455) days, a whole
 number rather than a number with a fraction of days.9

 The earliest eclipse theories in China developed during the Western Han and the
 Eastern Han. It is believed that the first li to contain an eclipse theory is the San

 tong li. The following system, the Si fen li，uses the same eclipse period, 23 eclipse

 possibilities in 135 months (Chen 2003).

 To calculate the lunar eclipses, use the remainder (after taking out) the Meeting

 Year, multiply the total number of months by 23. If it is over 135, divide it (by

 135). If it is not enough, add 23 to reach a month. If it is over 135, take the

 whole number out of the result. Count out (the last month), it is the month of the

 eclipse. This time is on the full moon's day. The sun is on the opposite of the

 synodic point.

 (Ban 1962)

 In the San tong li，the Meeting Year (hui sui 會歲)is a period of 513 years, which

 equals 6345 months. Liu Xin uses this huge number for a numerical reason. 634〕is

 the least common multiple of 135, the number of months in one eclipse period and

 235, the number of months in one Rule, the 19 years intercalary period. This means

 there are 47 135-month eclipse periods in one Meeting Year. After 6345 months, the

 cycle of eclipse period and the cycle of intercalation meet again in the same place. The

 total number of months is calculated from the epoch, when all astronomical periods in

 the li have a uniform starting point. The method uses the remainder after taking whole

 numbers of the Meeting Year out of the months from the epoch to the year we are

 calculating. According to the San tong li，there are 23 eclipses in 135 months. After

 each month, the eclipse period has passed 23/135 eclipses to the next whole number,

 when there is another eclipse (the text reads simply "to calculate the lunar eclipses,"

 but it is clear that k is referring to eclipse possibilities). We therefore multiply the total

 number of months by 23 and divide it by 135, which means dividing the number by

 135/23, the time between two eclipses. The fraction in the result shows where we are

 within that 135-month eclipse period. The number of months away from the end of

 this eclipse period is also how far away from the next eclipse.

 For example, if we calculate using 4 months as the remainder of the number of

 months after taking out the Meeting Year, we multiply 4 by 23 to find 92. Since 92 is

 less than 135, no eclipse has happened in the past 4 months. To find the next eclipse, we

 need to go beyond 135 and so we must add on two multiples of 23 to get to 138, which

 is larger than 135. Thus, there will be an eclipse in the second month of that year. If

 we calculate using 100 months as the remainder of the number of months after taking

 out the Meeting Year, we will find 100 times 23 equals 2300, which is greater than

 135. We therefore need to take out multiples of 135, which can be done by dividing

 2300 by 135 to find 17 5/135, from which we can remove the integer part to be left

 with 5/135. Next, we subtract 5 from 135 and divide the result by 23 to give 5 15/23,

 meaning that there will be an eclipse in the fifth month of the year.

 It is unclear whether the eclipse period in the San tong li is intended to be used for

 both solar and lunar eclipses or only for lunar eclipse. Recently, Shi Yunli and Xing

 Gang recalculated the lunar and solar eclipses with the San tong li method and argued

 that the San tong li was only used in lunar eclipse prediction. (Shi and Xing 2005)

 Later, in the three kingdom period and during the Jin dynasty, several new techniques

 were incorporated with, in particular, the consideration of lunar velocity. In addition,

 in the Qian xiang li，Liu Hong improved the traditional method by the invention of

 eclipse limits. Eclipse limits show the distance between where an eclipse possibility

 happens and the intersection of the sun and the moon's path. If the distance is outside

 of a certain range, an eclipse will not happen. Liu Hong uses less than 14 1115/1457
 du and greater than 158 (790+232/1882)/1457 du as the eclipse limits.10 In the Jing

 chu liy Yang Wei also considered the magnitude of the eclipse and the direction of

 impact of the shadow.

 4 The general eclipse prediction method in the Jing chu li

 Three issues are discussed in the eclipse section in the Jing chu li: first, the general

 eclipse method; second, related issues in eclipse prediction, for example the magnitude

 of the eclipse, the relative position of the moon to the sun's path, and the direction of

 obscuration when eclipse happens; and third, the adoption of lunar velocity theory in

 the eclipse theory. Similar to the earlier systems, the Jing chu li also uses an eclipse

 period and other cycles in its general eclipse method. The section reads as follows:

 The method of calculating the conjunction at the new moon, the Cross Coin

 cidences, and lunar eclipse is use the Lunar Accumulated Fen of that Era, add

 the number of the Draconitic-Synodic Differential Value of that Era to it, take

 the Conjunctional Connect out of it, the remainder is the Draconitic Value at

 the new moon of the eleventh month of the year. Add the Connect Number to

 it, take the Conjunctional Connect out when it reaches Conjunctional Connect,
 the remainder is the Draconitic Value at the new moon of the next month. Add

 the Syzygy Conjunction Constant to the Draconitic Value of the new moon of

 one month, take the Conjunctional Connect out when it reaches Conjunctional
 Connect, the remainder is the Draconitic Value at the full moon of the month.

 If the Draconitic Value at the new or full moon is smaller than the Syzygy Con

 Even thougn the nrst sentence or the text indicates it only predicts lunar eclipse,

 it is quite clear that this method is also intended to be used in the prediction of solar

 eclipse, given that both the new moon's day and the full moon's day are mentioned. The

 general eclipse method is to calculate the differences between one cycle and another,
 here, between the draconitic cycle and the eclipse cycle. In Fig.1，the arc above the
 line shows the draconitic cycle starting from the beginning of the Era. The arc below
 the line shows the eclipse cycle, which starts a little earlier than the beginning of
 the Era. The reason it starts earlier is because Yang Wei invented a term Draconitic
 Synodic Differential Value to mark the difference at the beginning of the Era between

 the draconitic cycle and the synodic cycle. This is the first time calculations in li are
 designed to start from multiple points rather than from the Li Epoch (li yuan 曆元）
 only. The Draconitic-synodic differential value for Jia shen Era 甲申紀 is 620139

 The principle of this method is to calculate the Draconitic Value, the period between

 the moment of the beginning of the draconitic cycle and the moment of conjunction.

 This shows the difference in time between the moment of conjunction and the moment
 when the lunar latitude is zero. If they are close enough, an eclipse might happen. If
 they are not close, the distance between the moon and the sun will be too far for
 the shadow to cause the eclipse. The way to judge whether it is close enough is to
 use eclipse limits, which are named the Syzygy Conjunction Constant and the Inner
 Draconitic Limit in the Jing chu li. The term Lunar Accumulated Fen refers to the fen

 at the beginning of one particular month and equals the number of synodic months
 from the beginning of that Era to the month we are calculating multiplied by the
 Connect Number, tongshu 通數134630, the length of a synodic month in the unit
 of the Day Divisor. The Chinese character fen shows the period related to the Lunar
 Accumulated Fen is also in the unit of Day Divisor, 1/4559 of one day. To calculate the
 Draconitic Value, one should take multiples of the Conjunctional Connect, 790110,
 out of the sum of Lunar Accumulated Fen and Connect Number to get the result. The

 term Inner Draconitic Limit shows how close is the end of one draconitic cycle to the
 end of one eclipse period: if the result is smaller than 67315 or bigger than 722795,

 there will be either a solar eclipse possibility at the new moon or a lunar eclipse at the
 full moon (recall that all the calculations are in the unit of the Day Divisor). See Fig. 2

 for situation around the end of the cycles. The arc above the line shows the draconitic

 cycle, and the arc below the line shows where one eclipse cycle ends.

 For example, if we want to calculate the first year of Jing Chu 景初 237
 AD According to the first sentence in the Jing chu li, ‘‘from (the year of)
 Ren Chen to the first year of the Jing Chu, there is a total of 4046 years.”
 壬辰以来，至景初元年丁巳歲，積四千四十六，算上。（Li 1974) Each Era has
 1843 years and so the first year of Jing Chu will be the 360th year of the third Era，
 Jia Shen 甲申 Era. We now only need to consider the situation in the Jia Shen Era

 in the general eclipse theory. To calculate the total number of months before the first
 year of Jing Chu, we multiply 360 by 235 and divide by 19 to find the result 4452
 12/19. This means there are a total of 4452 months before the eleventh month of the

 first year of Jing Chu. To calculate the Lunar Accumulated Fraction, we multiply the
 accumulated months 4452 by the Connective Number, 134630. The result of the Lunar
 Accumulated Fraction is 599372760. To calculate the Draconitic value, we add the

 Draconitic-Synodic Differential Value for the Jia Shen Era 620139 to it, take multiples
 of Conjunctional Connect, 790110, out, and the result 299409 is the Draconitic Value

 of the new moon's day of the eleventh month of the year. It is bigger than 67315 and
 smaller than 722795, so there is neither a Cross Coincidence at the new moon nor a

 lunar eclipse possibility at the full moon.

 5 The adoption of lunar velocity theory in eclipse theory

 One significant feature in the Jing chu li is the consideration of lunar velocity in the
 calculation of the time of an eclipse. Earlier systems only used the mean synodic
 month to calculate eclipse times. The Qian Xiang li is the first system in China to
 consider lunar velocity theory (Cullen 2002). In the Jing chu li, lunar velocity is used

 to calculate the time of the eclipse. This is explained in the next section of the Jing
 chu li:

 The method of calculating a lunar eclipse in the Velocity Calendar at the con
 junction at the new moon, the Cross Coincidences, says first add the Velocity
 Differential Value of that Era to the Lunar Accumulated Fen of that Era, take

 (multiples of) the Connect Cycle out, what is left is in days if it reaches the Day

 Divisor, the remainder is the Day Remainder. Count out the starting day, it is the

 moment of the conjunction of the eleventh month of the to-be-calculated year in
 the Velocity Calendar.

 To calculate the next month, add one to day and 4450 to the Day Remainder. To

 calculate the full moon's day, add 14 to day and 3489 to the Day Remainder.

 Convert the remainder to days when it reaches the Day Divisor and take out the

 days when k reaches 27. Take the remainder from the Circuit Day Remainder. If

 the remainder is not enough to subtract, take one day from it and add the Cycle

 Vacancy to it.

 This section shows how to calculate the conjunction at the new moon, the Cross

 Coincidences, and eclipses according to the Velocity Calendar. To calculate the con

 junction, we first calculate the difference between the numbers in synodic month and

 anomalistic month. The start point of all calculation is the beginning of that Era. First,

 add the Lunar Accumulated Fen, which corresponds to the length of time from the

 beginning of that Era to the first day of the to-be-calculated month, to the Velocity

 Differential Value, which corresponds to the difference between the beginning of that

 Era to the moment of the moon's closest perigee. Take multiples of the Connect Cycle

 125621, the length of anomalistic month, out of it. The result gives the difference

 between synodic months and anomalistic months. Accordingly, the result shows the

 difference between the synodic cycle and the velocity cycle. This section is â prepar

 ative step for the calculation afterward. All calculations are in the unit of the Day
 Divisor.

 To calculate the next month, add the difference between one synodic month and
 one anomalistic month: one synodic month is 134630/4559 and one anomalistic
 month is 125621/4559; thus, the difference is (134630-125621)/4559 = 9009/4559 =

 1 4450/4559. According to the text, “to calculate the next month, add one to day and

 4450 to the Day Remainder." The full moon's day is half a month from the beginning

 of one month. Half a month is (134630/2)/4559 that equals 67315/4559, which is also

 14 3489/4559. According to the text, “to calculate the full moon's day, add 14 to day
 and 3489 to the Day Remainder."

 This method is calculating the situation at the beginning and midpoint of a month

 based on the mean period of synodic month and anomalistic month. The following

 sections contain the Velocity Calendar, a table showing the velocity of the moon in

 different days in one month, and an explanation of how to calculate the true position

 of the moon based on the lunar velocity in any day. The table is named Chi ji li 遲疾靥

 (the three characters Chi 遲，ゾ/ 疾 and li 曆literally mean slow, fast, and calendar)
 and is summarized in Table l.11

 11 The velocity table in the Jing chu li is based upon the one devised by Liu Hong in the Qian xiang li but
 calibrated to work the Jing chu li Day Divisior.

 歹[J衰）column only appears in the Qian xiang li. It shows the changing of the moon's

 day-to-day speed. The Velocity Difference (sun yi lii 損益率）column, the Velocity

 Accumulative fen (ying suo ji fen 盈縮積分）column, and the Lunar Traveling Fen

 (yue xingfen 月行分）column are similar to the third, fourth, and fifth column here.

 The Velocity Accumulative fen in the Jing chu li appears in the unit of Day Divisor

 after multiplying 4559 to the Velocity Accumulation.

 In the first column, days are sequentially listed from 1 to 27. The Circuit Day in

 the last line refers the fraction of the day in an anomalistic month after 27 whole days.

 This fraction is 2528/4559 in the Jing chu li. In columns 2 and 3, the speed of the

 moon is listed day by day in du and fen、1/19 du. In the fourth column, the Velocity

 Difference compares the speed of the moon on one day and the average daily speed.

 From day 1 to day 14,less means add the speed by a certain number to get the average

 speed; more means subtract the speed by a number to reach the average speed. From
 day 15 to the Circuit Day, less means subtract the speed by a number to reach the

 average speed and more means add the speed by a number to get the average speed.

 The line of the Circuit Day listed the distance travelled by the moon with 14 du,13

 fen\, and 626. The number 626 has a denominator 2526. It is for one day rather than

 for the fraction of one day, this makes the total of the velocity from day 1 to day 28 is

 374 du 17 fen\ and 626/2526. It is more than the circle of 365 1/4 du (Liu 2003). We

 are able to calculate the numbers in column 4 by calculating the difference between

 the value in columns 2 and 3 and the average speed of the moon,13 du 1 fen\. For

 example, the speed of the moon in the 11th day is \2du 11 fen\. We subtract 1211/19

 from 13 7/19 to get 15/19 and put 15 in column 4, day 11.The result corresponds to

 the “Less 15” in column 4, day 11.In the column of the Regulation Accumulative Fen,

 the value shows the total of the Velocity Difference in Fen beginning from the first day.

 The positive and negative sign shows the difference in the daily speed of the moon

 compare to the average speed of the moon. The numbers are calculated from column

 2 and conversed to the unit oifeni by multiplying the Day Divisor 4559. Yang Wei

 uses the same Chinese character/ew 分 for both the unit/en2 and/eni.1 du equals 19

 feni and 1 feni equals 4559/^2- As a result, \fen\ equals 86621/例2. The number

 86621 comes from the Rule divisor,19, multiplied by the Day Divisor 4559. We are

 able to calculate the data in column 5 from column 4. For example, day 1 in column 4

 is 26. This means the moon travels 26 fen, or 1 7/19 du per day. In order to calculate

 the value for the third day in the fifth column, we multiply 1 7/19 by 86621 to get
 118534. The Velocity Difference for day 2, column 4 is 23. This means the moon

 travels 23fen\, or 1 4/19 du per day. In order to calculate the value for the third day

 in the fifth column, we multiply 1 4/19 to 86621, the result is 104857. The total of the

 Velocity Difference for day 1118534 and day 2 104857 is 223391, which gives us the

 value in day 3, column 5. The value for Day n in column 5 is the total of the Velocity

 Difference in column 4 from day 1 to day n-1 multiply by 4559, the result of 86621/19.

 Column 6 has the number showing the distance of the moon in feni for each day. It

 was calculated by multiplying 19 to the value of lunar velocity from column 2 and 3.

 To calculate the Velocity Major and Minor remainder of lunar eclipse at the new

 moon and the Cross Coincidences, multiply the fraction of day in the (Velocity)

 Calendar by the Velocity Difference in the Calendar, subtract or add (the result)

 from the Regulation Accumulative Fen to get the Velocity Accumulation fen.

 Subtract the Rule Year from the Lunar Traveling Fen according to the Velocity

 Calendar, divide the remainder from it (the Velocity Accumulation fen), subtract

 the positive or add the negative result to the minor remainder. If it reaches the

 Day Divisor, the time of the Cross Coincidence is on the following day. If it is not

 enough to subtract, the Cross Coincidence is on the preceding day. Follow the

 Velocity Major and Minor Remainder to set the moment of the lunar eclipse. If

 the moment is in the Circuit Day of the (Velocity) Calendar, multiply the fraction

 of day in the Circuit Day by the Negative Accumulative Fen to get the Velocity

 Accumulation Fen. Multiply the Decreasing Ratio by the fraction of day in the

 (Velocity) Calendar, then multiply k by the fraction of day in the Circuit Day,

 add it to [the multiplication of the remainder of the day according to the Calendar

 and]13 the minor/en of the Circdt Day, subtract it from the Velocity Accumula

 tion Fen, the remainder is the Post Velocity Accumulation Fen. Subtract the Rule

 Year from the Lunar Traveling fen in the Circuit Day, multiply the remainder by

 the fraction of day in the Circuit Day, add k to the du and the minor fen of the

 Circuit Day, divide it from the Post Velocity Accumulation Fen, add the result
 to the Minor Remainder, as the earlier method.

 Eclipse theory in the Jing chu li 117

 The Jing chu li is able to calculate not only the date of the Cross Coincidences

 and lunar eclipses, but also the exact moment. In earlier sections, we calculated the

 conjunction at the new moon, the Cross Coincidences, and lunar eclipses based on the

 mean speed of the moon. This section allows us to calculate the actual position of the

 moon based on the lunar velocity table in the preceding section and the mean position

 of the moon at the beginning of the month. This method is based upon predicting

 eclipses based on the Velocity Calendar in the earlier section. In order to make an

 accurate prediction, Yang Wei needs to adopt the lunar velocity theory in the general

 eclipse theory with mean lunar motion. The difficult part is to consider where the

 moment of the eclipse is in the Velocity Calendar and how much the moon has moved

 compared to its mean position. In order to calculate the exact time, Yang Wei calculates

 the Minor Remainder of the moment. He calls this the Velocity Minor Remainder. He

 does not calculate the Velocity Major Remainder because it is affected by the result of

 the Minor Remainder. If the moon's velocity is big enough, he adds or subtracts one

 day the mean major remainder, if not, the major remainder remains and is used as the

 Velocity Major Remainder. The starting point of all calculations is the beginning of

 that Era. All calculations are in the unit of the Day Divisor.

 There are two parts in the text, one explaining how to calculate the Velocity Minor

 Remainder from day 1 to day 27 in the Velocity Calendar and the other explaining

 how to calculate the Velocity Minor Remainder in the Circuit Day. The first step for

 both methods is to calculate the Velocity Accumulative fen (accumulative velocity

 fen). For day 1 to day 27,

 V.A.F. = R.A.F 士 F.V.C. x V.D.

 Then, the Jing chu li calculates the Velocity Minor Remainder,

 [m.r. 土 V.A.F./(L.T.F. 一 R.Y.)]/D.D.

 where

 m.r. minor remainder calculated earlier for the Cross Coincidence

 R.A.F Regulation Accumulative Fen
 F.V.C. the fraction of day in the (Velocity) Calendar
 V.D. Velocity Difference
 V.A.F. Velocity Accumulation fen
 R.Y. Rule Year,19

 L.T.F. Lunar Traveling Fen
 D.D. Day Divisor, 4559

 The reason to divide the Day Divisor is because the numbers of the m.r., R.A.F., and

 F.V.C. are all in the unit of the Day Divisor. We only need to discuss the astronomical

 meaning of m.r. 土 V.A.F. / (L.T.F.一 19). Yang Wei begins the calculation from m.r., the

 result from earlier section and adds the regulation V.A.F. / (L.T.F. -19) to it. According

 to the Velocity Calendar, the V.A.F. shows the regulation from the beginning of the

 month to the preceding day. Yang Wei wants to get the actual position of the moon by

 means of i) adding the velocity of the moon from the beginning of the month to the

 preceding day by adding the V.A.F. to the m.r. and ii) adding the velocity of the moon

 on the calculating day by multiplying F.V.C. to the V.D.，which marks the change
 in the speed of the moon on that day. The result shows how far the moon moved in

 the unit offen\ (the R.A.F. is in the unit of/どれ2, the multiplication offen\ and the

 D.D., V.D. is in the unit offen\), Yang Wei divides it by the difference between the

 sun and the moon's motion. The speed of the sun is 1 du per day, which equals 19

 fen\ per day. L.T.F. means the moon travels 231-280 知1 in one day. This changes

 the result from having a distance unit to fraction without unit. Then, Yang Wei adds

 the result to the minor remainder to get the Velocity Accumulation fen. If it is bigger

 than the Day Divisor, add one to the major remainder, which marks the day of the

 Cross Coincidence. Then, the time of the Cross Coincidence will be on the following

 day. If the result is negative, subtract one to the major remainder and the time of the

 cross Coincidence is in the preceding day. If the result is between 0 and 1，there is

 no more regulation on the major remainder and the Cross Coincidence is on the day

 calculated from the mean periods. Following the method from this section, the time

 01 lunar eclipse should be based on the Velocity Minor Remainder, that is to say, the

 lunar velocity theory.

 The second part to calculate the Velocity Minor Remainder in the Circuit Day is

 mathematically more complicated but astronomically the same. Yang Wei uses a Post

 Velocity Accumulation Fen. This method can be converted to the same method used to

 calculate the Velocity Minor Remainder from day 1 to day 27 in the Velocity Calendar
 (Liu 2003).

 Velocity Accumulation Fen = F.C.D. x R.A.F.

 Post Velocity Accumulation Fen = F.V.C x R.A.F.

 一(V.D. x F.V.C. x F.C.D. + m.f.C.D.)

 F.C.D. the fraction of day in the Circuit Day in the (Velocity) Calendar
 m.f.C.D. the minor/en of the Circuit Day

 To calculate the time, multiply the Velocity Minor Remainder by 12, convert it

 to double hours when it reaches the Day Divisor. The counting begins from Zi

 子，count out. The result is the moment of oppositions in double-hour. If there is

 a remainder (of double hours), multiply it by 4 and divide it by the Day Divisor,

 one (1/4) is small {shao 少)，two is half (ban 半)，three is larger (tai 太).If there

 is again a remainder, multiply it by three and divide it by the Day Divisor, one

 names strong {qiang 強).If (the remainder) is more than one half (1/2)，adopt it.

 If it is less than one half, take it out. Add strong and small (1/12 + 3/12) to get

 strong small (4/12). Add strong and half (1/12 + 6/12) to get strong half (7/12).

 Add strong and large (1/12 + 9/12) to get strong large (10/12). Two strong (1/12)

 make k a weak small (2/12)，add it to small (3/12) to get weak half (5/12), add it

 to half (6/12) to get weak large (8/12), add it to large (9/12) to get weak (11/12) in

 one double-hour. Name it with the related double-hour and get the small, large,

 half, strong, and weak. If the full moon's day when the eclipse happens is no

 more than 4 days away from one solar term, see the Limit Number. If the full

 moon's day is more than 5 days away from the solar term, see the Interval Limit

 This section shows how to converse the result of the time in the last section to the

 12 double-hour civil time reckoning. Twelve branches are used as the names of the
 12 double hours (see Table 3). Twelve divisions are used in the exact time reckoning

 within double hours (see Table 4). Strong and weak are adjectives used on the divisions

 and whole numbers. Strong means “1/12 more" and add 1/12 to the divisions. Weak
 means “1/12 less" and subtract 1/12 from the divisions.

 6 Conclusion

 As one of the most significant astronomical phenomenon in Chinese mathematical

 astronomy and astrology, eclipses and eclipse theories are important parts in Chinese

 IL The adoption the lunar velocity theory in the Qian xiang li and Jing chu li is

 a significant improvement on eclipse theory. In Chinese dynastic histories, there is

 a tradition of making comments on people and their work in earlier periods. In an

 evaluation paragraph on the early li makers found in the Song shu, Shen Yue 沈約

 aptly sums up the importance of Yan Wei's work,

 Among the ancient li makers, Deng Ping was able to revise the existing method

 and establish new ones based on it. Liu Hong is the first to criticize Sifen li; he also

 worked on lunar velocity. After careful considerations, following the intention

 of examining the differences, Yang Wei set a parameter called difference based

 on the accumulated fen at conjunction and used it to predict lunar eclipse. These

 three people are li masters in the Han and Wei; however, Hong's lunar velocity
 table cannot be used to check the dates in the Chun qiu and Wei's planetary

 theory is significantly wrong with time passes. This is because Hong has not

 paid enough attention; Wei is limited by putting Shang Yuan in the day Ren
 chen.

 古之為曆者，鄧平能修舊制新，劉洪始減《四分》，又定月行遲疾，楊偉斟酌兩端，

 以立多少之衷，因朔積分設差，以推合朔月蝕。此三人，漢、魏之善曆者，然而洪之

 遲疾，不可以檢《春秋》；偉之五星，大乖於後代，斯則洪用心尚疏，偉拘於同出上元

 壬辰故也。

 Cycle Vacancy (zhou xu 周虛）.The différence between the Day Divisor and the
 Circuit Day Remainder is 2031，2528 + 2031=4559. Yang Wei names it Cycle

 Vacancy, which is for mathematical use rather than astronomical. The other part

 of the remainder of day.

 Cross Coincidences (jiao hui 交會),jiao, crossing, refers to the intersection of

 the sun's path and the moon's path, or to the transit of the sun or moon. Hui

 refers to conjunctions. Jiao hui implies the situation that when eclipse happens,

 the conjunction is close to the lunar node.14

 Lunar Accumulated Fen (shuo 朔積分).Shuo means the beginning of one month,

 ji means accumulated, fen is the unit used in calculation. Lunar Accumulated Fen

 refers to the fen at the beginning of one month. The value equals the number of

 synodic months from the beginning of that Era to the calculating month multiply

 by Connective Number, 134630, the length of one synodic month.
 Draconitic-Synodic Differential Value (jiaohui chalii 交會差率).Jiao 交 refers
 to "related to draconitic cycle.’’ Hui 會 refers to "related to synodic cycle." The

 value shows the difference between two cycles when a particular astronomical

 phenomenon, such as eclipse, happens.
 Conjunctional Connect (hui tong 會通 790110). Conjunctional Connect is the
 eclipse period in the unit of day divisor 4559. If we divide Conjunctional
 Connect by Connect Number, the length of one synodic month, the result is

 790110/134630, which equals 5 116960 /134630 months.

 Draconitic Value (qu jiao du fen 去交度分）means the time between the calcu

 lating time to the happening of conjunction. The term is also in the unit of day

 divisor. To calculate the Draconitic value, one should take Conjunctional connect

 out of the sum of Lunar accumulated fen and Connect Number to get the result.

 Syzygy Conjunction Constant (shuowang heshu 朔望合數）is 67315. The term

 presents half of the synodic month. The number is half of the Connect number
 134630.

 Inner Draconitic Limit (rujiao xianshu 入交限數)，722795. It is the difference

 between the Conjunctional Connect 790110 and the Syzygy Conjunction constant

 67315. The term shows how close is the end of one draconitic cycle to the end of

 one eclipse period.
 Li Epoch(/i yuan 暦元)，also called Grand Epoch (shang yuan 上元).

 Circuit Day Remainder (zhou ri ri yu 周日日餘)• The remainder of a day after a
 complete cycle, usually produced in calculation.

 Ratio of Increasing and Decreasing (sun yi lii 損益率）.The data showing the

 difference in the actual lunar speed to the average daily speed (Chen 1995). Two

 ratios are included in the column, Decreasing Ratio 損率，showing the values

 slower than the average speed and Increasing Ratio 益率，the values faster than

 the average speed.
