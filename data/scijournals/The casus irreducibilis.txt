 Abstract In Cardano's classification in the Ars Magna (1545,1570), the cubic equa

 tions were arranged in thirteen families. This paper examines the well-known solution
 methods for the families χ3 + a\x = ao and x3 = a\x + ao and then considers thor

 oughly the systematic interconnections between these two families and the remaining

 ones and provides a diagram to visualize the results clearly. In the analysis of these

 solution methods, we pay particular attention to the appearance of the square roots

 of negative numbers even when all the solutions are real—the so-called casus irre

 ducibilis. The structure that comes to light enables us to fully appreciate the impact

 that the difficulty entailed by the casus irreducibilis had on Cardano's construction in

 the Ars Magna. Cardano tried to patch matters first in the Ars Magna itself and then

 in the De Régula Aliza (1570). We sketch the former briefly and analyze the latter in

 detail because Cardano considered it the ultimate solution. In particular, we examine
 one widespread technique that is based on what I have called splittings.

 1 Introduction

 At the middle of the sixteenth century in Europe, equations were dealt with in the con

 text of algebra treatises. During the early Renaissance, the Arabic algebraic tradition

 had already reached Europe through the mercantile paths, and its knowledge of equa

 tions had been assimilated. For many centuries, scholars could solve any quadratic

 equation provided that it has real solutions. On the other hand, solving cubic equa
 tions in general by radicals still constituted an obstacle. Here and there, even before

 the 16th century, some cubic equations with numerical coefficients had been solved,

 but particular methods (that is, methods that depend on the coefficients and cannot be

 generalized to any cubic equation) were employed. Some approximation methods had
 also been developed to deal with cubic equations.

 The topic of cubic equations was successfully approached for the first time in the

 context set by the abaco tradition in what is today northern Italy. There a certain

 number of scholars, Scipione del Ferro, Tartaglia, Girolamo Cardano, and Ludovico

 Ferrari among them, worked on this subject. As it is well known, the paternity of

 the solution methods for cubic equations was highly disputed. Allegedly, Scipione del

 Ferro discovered some of the solution methods in Bologna before his death in 1526, but

 he kept the lid on his results until the very end of his life. A few years later, Tartaglia,

 during a mathematical public duel with del Ferro's pupil, came to some comparable

 results, and the news reached Cardano. In 1539, he managed to make Tartaglia reveal

 his methods to him, and six years later, he published an improved and augmented

 version of these. This gave rise to the well-known dispute between Tartaglia, who felt

 robbed, and Cardano's pupil Ferrari, who had by now also come to the solution of

 quartic equations.

 In the following, we focus on Cardano's algebraic treatises. We deal in particular

 with the solution methods for cubic equations that are delivered in the middle of his

 masterpiece, the Ars Magna, and with the (expected) patch to these methods that

 should have been contained in the De Régula Aliza.

 2 A precision concerning Cardano's cubic equations

 In order to best grasp Cardano's treatment of cubic equations, we need to start from the

 very beginning. In this section, I would like to take stock of equations in his algebraic

 works,1 and in particular of the way in which cubic equations are expressed. This will

 let us see that Cardano did not have a terminology available for speaking of cubic

 equation in the abstract—that is, when the coefficients are completely unspecified—

 and so, he needed to take into account many different families of cubic equations and

 classify them according to some criteria.

 1 Namely, they are the Practica Arithmeticae (1539), the Ars Magna Arithmeticae (1663), the Ars Magna
 (1545,1570), and the De Régula Aim (1570).

 Concerning in particular the Ars Magna Arithmeticae, we remark that the only edition that we have available

 is the one posthumously printed in Cardano's Opera Omnia. For a long time, it has been considered as a

 minor work and in any case as a late work (see Bortolotti 1926; Loria 1950, p. 298). Cardano himself did

 not mention this treatise in his autobiographies and never sent it to be printed. Moreover, the (supposedly

 chronological) position of the published version in the framework of the 1663 Opera Omnia contributed

 to the misunderstanding because the Ars Magna Arithmeticae was wrongly placed after the Ars Magna.
 Thanks to some recent reappraisals of Cardano's mathematical writings (see Tamborini 2003, pp. 177—
 179; Gavagna 2012), it is nowadays commonly agreed that the Ars Magna Arithmeticae was conceived
 before—or at least at the same time as—the Ars Magna.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 259

 In agreement with Renaissance habits, Cardano wrote equations in words, employ

 ing the common Latin terminology. The coefficient of the term of degree zero—as

 we call it nowadays2—is called a 'number (numerus)', the unknown a 'thing (res)' or

 'position (positio)', the unknown to the second power a 'square (quadratus)' or 'cen

 sus', and the unknown to the third power a 'cube (cubus)'.3 We can consider that for

 Cardano, an equation is written in the standard form when it is monic. Indeed, in the

 great majority of the cases, he directly took into account monic equations and, when

 the equation is not, the first step is to reduce it to a monic one. When the coefficients

 of the unknown or of its powers are different from 1 and Cardano did not want to

 specify their numerical value, he employed plural forms, like 'some things (res)' or

 'some squares (quadrati)'. We remark that even though Cardano had available this

 work around for speaking about families of equations where the numerical value of

 the coefficients is not pointed out, he did not have any particular preference to employ

 it rather than to specify the coefficients. Indeed, as it was common at that time, one

 could do mathematics in a general way, but yet not in the abstract.

 Abbreviations, like 'p: ' or 'p. ' for 'plus', are frequently used, but they are not always

 stable (for instance, 'cube' is sometimes abbreviated 'cub.' or 'cu.' and sometimes

 written in full words). The role of these shorthand expressions, far from being an
 established formalism, is to shorten the text, in the same manner as the accents in
 Renaissance Latin did.

 Cardano was of course interested in finding the real solutions of the equations

 that he considered. He usually preferred the positive ones [called 'true (vera)'], but

 it sporadically happens that also the negative ones [called 'fictitious (ficta)'] were
 mentioned.4

 At this point, one is quite naturally led to wonder what, for Cardano, are the quan

 tities that I have called 'coefficients' above. The status of these quantities depends to a

 great extent on what Cardano considered to be a numerus. In comparison to our sets of

 2 I have deliberately chosen to expound Cardano's mathematics using some terminology and symbols that

 he did not employ. Of course, this betrays to a certain extent the text and can lead to over-interpreting it.

 However, I believe that the advantages for the reader in terms of grasping the contents precisely are worth

 the risk. For the same reason and for the sake of brevity, I use certain notations, especially the discriminant

 Δ3, that refer to Cardano's equations. In this case, the discriminant is not to be understood in the modem

 sense, that is, as a symmetric function of the roots of the corresponding polynomial. Rather it is a shorthand

 for the number that is under the square root in Cardano's formulae (even though this number has the same

 value up to a constant as the symmetric function evaluated at an appropriate point).

 3 Here and there in Cardano's mathematical treatises, we also find equations of higher degrees. The prime

 degrees of the unknown greater than three that Cardano mentioned are the 'first related (relatus primus)' for

 degree five and the 'second related (relatus secundus)' for degree seven. The non-prime degrees are obtained

 by multiplication of prime factors, such as for instance the 'square of a square (quadrati quadratus)' for
 degree four, the 'cube of a square (quadrati cubus)' for degree six, the 'square of a square of a square

 (ιquadrati quadrati quadratus)' for degree eight, the 'cube of a cube (cubi cubus)' for degree nine.

 4 Interestingly, in Ars Magna, Chapter XXXVII Cardano gave a justification of the fact that one is also

 entitled to take into account negative solutions. Indeed, a negative solution of a certain family of equations

 is admissible as long as it corresponds to a positive solution of another family of equations where some of

 the coefficients are opposite in sign. For instance, this happens for x2 = a\x + ao and y2 + a\y = ao, see

 Cardano (1545, Chapter XXXVII, rule I, p. 65v) but also for x3 + ao = a\x and y3 = a\y + oq, and for
 x3 + açx2 = αο and y3 4- oq = «çy2 (see Cardano 1545, Chapter I, Paragraphs 5-6 and 8, pp. 4r-4v and
 5r-5v).

 numbers, he had available only an incomplete system of numbers that was not closed

 under every algebraic operation. More precisely, he took the freedom to consider that

 when he performed some algebraic operations on rational numbers, other numbers

 that he knew how to deal with were produced. For instance, the operation of taking

 the square root applied to 2 gives V2, and Cardano knew how to further perform

 algebraic operations on this number. This remark opens a broad-ranging issue: how

 can we characterize Cardano's numbers? And, moreover, was Cardano's conception
 of numbers common at that time?

 These fundamental questions are far from being naive, and trying for an answer is not

 the aim of this paper. Therefore, rather than attempting for an interpretation, I provide

 only a descriptive account. In Cardano's algebraic treatises, these coefficients are

 always nonzero, positive numbers. Wherever we would write a negative coefficient, we

 find that in Cardano's equations, it has been moved on the other side of the equality.5 In

 the great majority of the examples, the coefficients are rational (even natural) numbers,

 but in a small handful of cases, irrational numbers also appear (see, for instance,
 Footnote 19).

 Concerning cubic equations in particular, Cardano classified them according to the

 following criteria. He took into account only those that cannot be solved in elementary

 ways, that is, equations that cannot be solved by simply taking the third root and

 that do not come down in degree by means of a substitution. Therefore, when it
 comes to solving cubic equations, the families χ3 = ao, x3 = a\x, χ3 = aix2,
 x3 = a2X2+a\x,x3+a2X2 = aix,andx3+aix = ajx2 are not considered. Moreover,
 since Cardano considered equations with positive (real) solutions, the families of
 equations x3 + a\x + ao = 0, x3 + ajx -F ao = 0, and x3 + a2X2 + a\x + ao = 0
 do not appear in the classification either. In the end, Cardano had thirteen families of
 cubic equations divided into:

 - depressed equations lacking a second degree term:

 x3 + a\x = ao or cubus et res aequales numéro,

 χ3 = aix + ao or cubus aequalis rebus et numéro,

 x3 + ao = ajx or cubus et numerus aequales rebus;

 - equations lacking a first degree term:

 χ3 = a2X2 + ao or cubus aequalis quadratis et numéro,

 χ3 + a2X2 = ao or cubus et quadrati aequales numéro,

 x3 + ao = a2X2 or cubus et numerus aequales quadratis;

 5 Sometimes, Cardano wrote an equation such as λ3 = α2*2 + αο in the form x2(x — 02) = ag. Despite
 the fact that a minus sign appears, we observe that this does not mean that Cardano allowed negative

 numbers in an equation since ag > 0 implies that χ — 02 > 0 (but it would have been so if he had written
 λ3 - U2X2 = ag, which he never did).

 This provides an effective way of arranging cubic equations in families so that it is

 easier to speak about them. In the main, Cardano's classification conveys a combina

 tory oriented, linguistic concern, rather than being governed by purely mathematical

 requirements.6

 3 Cardano solves cubic equations in the Ars magna

 The so-called Ars Magna appeared in 1545,7 where the most advanced results of
 that time on equations were released. The importance of the Ars Magna can only be

 understood by contrasting it with what came before: for the first time, all the scattered

 procedures, techniques, and particular cases that had been discovered were replaced

 by a highly systematic treatment of cubic equations, which also included proofs. This

 does not mean, however, that the Ars Magna itself is a systematic treatise: even though

 we can identify in the middle of the book (Chapters XI-XXIII) the consistent block

 that delivers the famous solution methods for cubic equations, what comes before and

 after is still a miscellany of rules. As such, the tricky contents of the Ars Magna also

 moved away from the usual considerations of the algebra treatises of that time.

 Every chapter in the middle block has the same structure. For each one of the

 thirteen families of cubic equations, Cardano first provided a proof (demonstratio)
 of its solution method,8 from which he subsequently deduced a rule (régula), that

 6 We remark that a classification in the same vein can already be found, for instance, in al-Khayyâm's

 de regulis algebraicis, liber unus, qui et [sic] totius opens de arithmetica, quod opus perfectum inscripsit,
 est in ordine decimus, see Cardano (1545). This first edition was published in Nuremberg in 1545 by
 Iohannes Petreium. The second edition was published in Basel in 1570 by Oficina Henricpetrina and was

 a joint volume together with the De Proportionibus and the De Régula Aliza. There is, moreover, a third

 posthumous edition in the Opera Omnia. The second edition contains some additions, while the third edition

 is virtually the same as the second one. We also have the available manuscript Plimpton 510/1700: s.a.,

 which is entitled L'algebra, at the Columbia University Library in New York.

 According to the title, the Ars Magna should have filled up the tenth volume of a certain Opus Arithmeticae

 Perfectum, which was never realized. This should have been an encyclopedic work on mathematics com
 posed of fourteen books and was probably conceived between the 1530s and the 1560s. For an extensive

 explanation of this reference, see Gavagna (2010, p. 65) and Cardano (2004, pp. 64-66).

 8 Whether, and if so to what extent, these proofs contain geometrical arguments is up to discussion.

 is to say, a step-by-step description of the operations that one has to perform on the

 coefficients of the equation under consideration in order to get a solution. This is a

 numerical value that substituted in the equation returns a true equality. In three cases

 (namely, in Chapters XI, XII, and XIV), the rule is in fact a formula that allows one

 to write a solution by combining the coefficients of the equations directly through the

 usual algebraic operations. In the other cases, the rules involve some substitutions for

 transforming the equation at issue into another one, the solution method of which has

 already been explained. After that, we sometimes find an additional and/or alternative

 proof and always some numerical examples.

 3.1 The two pristine solution methods and the casus irreducibilis

 In Chapters, XI and XII Cardano dealt, respectively, with the pristine family of equa
 tions x3 + a\x = ao and χ3 = a\x + αο· Indeed, as we will see in Sect. 4, the solution

 methods for all the families of cubic equations can be reduced to one of these two.

 Many accounts have been given in the secondary literature,9 and for our purpose, it

 is enough to sketch the overall structure of the arguments. In these chapters, Cardano

 argued in a completely analogous, though independent way. First, as he always did,

 he translated the algebraic setting into a geometrical environment, where I use 'geo

 metrical' merely to mean that Cardano spoke about points, segments, surfaces, and

 solids.10 The tricky parts of the proofs in these chapters follow from the key idea,
 which is to write, respectively, χ = y -ζ and χ = y + z and to take, respectively, the

 systems

 and

 ao = y — z

 ao = y3 + z3

 f = yz.

 where the coefficients of the two equations are associated to some functions of y and

 z. Then, Cardano used the development of the cube of a binomial and the properties of

 the operations on the measures of segments to show that such χ s are solutions of the

 equations. Indeed, speaking about geometrical objects, he performed the actions that

 9 These solution methods are indeed the most taken into account in the secondary literature: see, among

 others, Cantor (1892), Bortolotti (1926), Boyer (1991), Bashmakova and Smirnova (2000) and Maracchia
 (2005). For a detailed account of these two solution methods as well as all the others, see also Confalonieri
 (2013, pp. 103-151).

 10 In other words, I employ the term 'geometrical' only on a superficial linguistic level, and I do not

 associate to it a precise interpretation of what geometry was for Cardano. Note in particular that the fact

 that Cardano spoke about points and other such objects does not necessarily mean that he also employed

 the positional properties of these objects. Concerning the general relation between geometry and positional
 arguments, see Panza (2007).

 are equivalent to replacing such assumed values of x, a\, and ao in the equations. These

 proofs, like all the ones in the middle block of the Ars Magna, give no hint of how

 Cardano got the key idea—in these two cases, to use the substitutions χ = y ± ζ and

 the above systems.11 We, moreover, remark that once one has made the substitutions

 and has the systems, one also has at hand the rules, which—as has been said—are

 descriptions of the cubic formulae in algorithmic terms. Indeed, the formulae are

 obtained by solving the systems depending on y3, z3 (which is possible since solving

 these systems is equivalent to solve two quadratic equations), taking the (real) cubic

 roots of their solutions, and exploiting their internal symmetries to reduce the number
 of solutions.

 There is nevertheless a very remarkable difference between the solution methods for

 the families of equations x3 + a\x = ao and χ3 = αχχ+αο: in the first case, the cubic

 formula never contains square roots of negative numbers, whereas this can happen in

 the second case. To verify this, it is enough to have a look at the two formulae

 (t)2 + (t)3

 11 Historically speaking, it seems very likely that the idea came straight from Tartaglia's poem (up to a

 change of variables). Indeed, its first two verses describe the substitutions and the systems:

 When the cube with the things next to it

 is made equal to some other discrete number
 find two others the difference of which [is] this.

 Hereafter, you will consider this customarily

 that their product always will be exactly equal

 to the third of the cube of the things.

 Its general remainder then

 of their cube sides appropriately subtracted

 will be the value of your principal unknown.

 In the second of these acts

 when the cube remains alone,

 you will observe these other arrangements,

 you will immediately make of the number two such parts

 that the one times the other will produce straightforward

 the third of the cube of the things

 of which then by common precept

 you will take the cube sides joined together

 and this sum will be your concept.

 Quesito ΧΧΧΙΠ, p. 119). Nevertheless, this only displaces the difficulty to finding out how Tartaglia (or
 whoever else) got the key idea.

 respectively, for χ3 + ajx = αο and χ3 = αιχ + αο in Chapters XI and XII. Nowadays

 we know, as an elementary consequence of Galois theory, that when a cubic equation

 has three real distinct solutions, imaginary numbers necessarily appear in the cubic

 formula. This means that—roughly speaking—in order to arrive at a simple solution,
 one cannot avoid passing through a more complicated formula. Down the centuries,
 this has been called the casus irreducibilisP Since Cardano did not allow square
 roots of negative numbers,13 he had to count them out by imposing a condition on the

 coefficients of x3 = a\x + clq. In 1545 Ars Magna, the condition is stated as follows:

 when the cube of the third part of the number of the things exceeds the square

 of the half of the number of the equality, which happens whenever the number

 of the equality is less than | of this cube or when a number greater than the

 number of the equality is produced from | the number of the things times the

 root of j the same number, then this can be solved by the aliza question, which
 is discussed in the book on the geometrical questions. But if you wish to avoid

 such a difficulty, you may be satisfied for the most part by Chapter XXV of this

 12 We do not know exactly when this term came into use. The first occurrence of which I am aware is in

 Lagny (1697). I thank David Rabouin for this reference.

 13 This also happened in the case of quadratic equations. Considering x2+ao = a\x in Chapter V, Cardano

 asked for a condition on the coefficients (namely, (^)2 - ao > 0) so that negative numbers never appear
 under square roots. More precisely, the condition is "[i]f that subtraction of the number from the square of

 the half of the number of the things cannot be done, the question itself is false and what has been proposed

 cannot be ("[q]uod si detractio ipsa numeri a quadrato dimidii numeri rerum fieri nequit, quœstio ipsa est
 falsa, necesse potest quod proponitu)", see Cardano (1545, Chapter V, p. 1 lv).

 Nevertheless, there is an isolated passage in the Ars Magna where Cardano tried to justify the square roots

 of negative numbers. This is in Chapter XXXVII, while discussing "the rules for assuming a false (régula

 falsum ponendi)" and in particular in the proof of Rule II (see Cardano 1545, p. 66r). This is about solving

 a certain system equivalent to a quadratic equation with two complex, nonreal solutions. Cardano used the

 quadratic formula to find their (correct) value (namely, "5 p: R m: 5 and 5 m: R m: 5", that is, 5 ± V-15),

 and then provided a proof, which is in short a geometrical interpretation of the quadratic formula. There,

 he had a try at linking the expression V-15 to a geometrical object, namely to the difference between a

 surface and a segment (where the surface is called AD and measures 25 and the segment AB that measures

 10 is taken four times: "imaginaberis R m: 15, id est differentiae AD et quadrupli AB"). A few lines later,

 Cardano commented that this is "sophisticated" since one cannot carry it out with the same operations with

 a negative quantity ("quae vere est sophistica, quoniam per earn, non ut in puro m: nec in aliis, operationes
 exercere licet"). In my opinion, this amounts to one of the earliest investigations of the square roots of

 negative numbers. At the same time, it also shows how far Cardano was from being acquainted with these

 kinds of numbers. It is in fact significant that this chapter comes long after the ones that deliver the solution

 methods for quadratic and cubic equations and that it was a marginal comment.

 while in 1570, the last part of the quotation was modified into "then consult the book of

 alizahere appended (tunc consules librumAlizae hie adjectum)", see Cardano (1570a,

 Chapter ΧΠ, p. 62).

 3.2 The other solution methods

 In Chapter XIII, Cardano dealt with the family of equations χ3+ao = a\x. Its solution

 method, as it is expounded in the proof, consists in transforming the equation at issue

 into y3 = aiy + ao through one of the substitutions15

 ->(§)·

 As before, no hint is given about how the substitutions were discovered, and in this

 case, Tartaglia's poem only tells about a certain connection with y3 = a\y + ao,
 without going any further. Cardano provided also an additional proof to show how,

 given a (real) solution of the equation at issue, one can obtain a second solution (when
 a real one exists).

 All the remaining solution methods consist in giving a suitable substitution for

 transforming the equation at issue either into one of the three discussed above or into an

 equation that Cardano knew how to solve without using a cubic formula (namely, into

 x3 = ao or x3 = aix). In Chapters XIV-XVI, Cardano dealt with the cubic equations

 lacking in the first degree term and in Chapters XVII-ΧΧΠΙ with the complete ones.

 Let us consider an example. Chapter XIV is about the family of equations jc3 =

 a2X2 + ao- This chapter is quite short, and in this sense, it is illustrative of Cardano's

 ways of proceeding: it starts with a brief remark, followed by a proof (which fills
 up most of the chapter), then the rule derived from it, and then one example. The

 structure of this chapter is simple because the family of equations jc3 = a2X2 + ao, as
 was already the case with x3+a\x = ao, never falls into the casus irreducibilis, so that

 Cardano neither needed to add a condition nor to provide many examples. The opening

 remark points out that the equation at issue can be changed into16 y3 = a\y + oq. The

 15 From the modem viewpoint, these are not real changes of variable since the maps m«2 and «h»·^

 are not bijections. This is sometimes the case in Cardano's substitutions. Anyway, if we consider that Cardano

 favored positive numbers, his substitutions are invertible. Indeed, in the examples that he provided, he used
 the substitutions in both directions, see for instance Footnote 19.

 for the transformed equation in y. However, if we go and check the discriminant of the transformed

 proof is as follows. Cardano transformed the algebraic setting of the problem (that is,
 to solve the abstract family of equations χ3 = a2X2 + ao) into a specified geometrical
 environment (see Fig. 1), and considered the equation

 He implicitly assumed that BC = | = 2 and wanted to show that the above equation
 can be changed into

 AC3 = 6AC2 + 100.

 AB3 = 12 AB + 116

 through the substitution AC = A Β + BC. By the square of a binomial, Cardano knew
 that AC2 = AB2 + 2AB BC + BC2, and therefore, AC2 = AB2 + 4AB +4, which

 in turn implies that

 AC3 = 6 (AB2 + 4AZJ + 4) + 100.

 On the other hand, by the cube of a binomial, Cardano got

 AC3 = (AB + BC)3 = AB3 + 3AB2 BC + 3AB BC2 + BC3.

 Finally, by comparison and developing the calculations, he obtained the desired
 equation

 AB3 = \2AB + 116.

 At this point, since Cardano knew how to solve the transformed equation in AS by
 Chapter XII, the relation AC = AB + BC yields the solution of the equation in AC.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 267

 We remark that if we take AC = χ and A Β = y, Cardano is in truth performing the

 substitution χ = y + ^ in a geometrical fashion. The proof consists essentially in
 showing that by replacing the assumed value of χ in the equation χ3 = α2χ2 + ao,

 one gets the equation y3 = a\y + αο· Afterwards, Cardano summed up the proof in
 the following rule:

 Add the cube of the third part of the number of the squares to the half of the

 number of the equality and multiply the whole that is made from there to the

 square. Take away the cube of the square of the third part of the number of the

 squares, add or decrease the root of the remainder to or from the aggregate that

 you had multiplied by itself. You will have the binomium and the apotome. Join

 their cubic roots and add to them the third part of the number of the squares,

 and the whole that is composed is the value of the thing ([a]dde cubum tertiae

 Indeed, if we consider the equation x3 = a2x2 + ao and apply to it the substitution

 χ = y + we get the transformed equation y3 = ^y + {γ^α\ + ao). Then, using
 the cubic formula in Chapter XII, we immediately have the above formula. We remark

 that, since ao and a2 are always positive, the number under the square root is always
 positive.

 It can happen that after having performed the substitution in the equation at

 issue, the sign of the coefficients) of the transformed equation is not a priori deter
 mined. More precisely, in Chapters XV, XIX, XXI, and XXII, the sign of ao is
 not determined, and therefore, Cardano needed to discuss some cases. In Chapters
 XVII and XVIII, the signs of neither ao nor a\ are determined, so Cardano also

 needed to discuss some subcases. In Chapter XV, we exceptionally find two sub

 stitutions for χ2 + α2χ2 = ao: the first one (which is χ = y - ^) leads to sev
 eral cases, while the second one (which is χ = y2 — α2) leads to a unique case. In

 Chapter XVI, as for Chapter ΧΠΙ, an additional proof for obtaining a second solu

 a first one. In Chapter XVIII, Cardano quoted a second rule by Ferrari with its
 proof. We finally notice that as for the families of equations a3 + a\x = ao and
 x3 = a2X2 + ao, two cases in Chapters XVII and XVIII never fall into the casus
 irreducibilis.

 Substitutions were, therefore, a fundamental tool for dealing with cubic equations

 for Cardano. In Table 1, the substitutions in the solution methods in Ars Magna,
 Chapters XI-XXIII are summarized. We note that the two most elaborate ones are

 χ = y ± ψ. At that time, a few scholars seemed to be aware of these substitu
 tions that (always) make the term of second degree vanish.18 In general, Cardano
 employed substitutions widely to deal with equations—this is one of the most fre

 quently used tools in his algebraic treatises. In particular, in the Ars Magna, we find

 two other remarkable substitutions (at least, as regards our aim in this paper, as we

 will see in the next section): they are in Chapter VII, which is entirely devoted to

 substitutions and allow us to pass from x3 + a\x — ao to y3 = a'7y2 + a'() and vice
 versa.

 18 See Franci (1985).

 19 See Cardano(1545,Chapter VII,Paragraphs 3-4 and 8-9,pp. 18r-18vand 19v-20r). More precisely, the

 substitutions are χ = and χ = y2 + a0. As said, Cardano's substitutions can be considered invertible

 as long as he only considers the positive roots while taking the 2n-th roots. We remark that the substitution

 χ — y2 -f- @o is also in Chapter XV, but is applied to a different family of equations. Concerning the first

 substitution, Cardano provided two examples: x3 + 18ν = 8, which is transformed into χ3 = 36x + 8 (but

 Cardano wrongly wrote χ 3 = 9x2 + 8), and χ3 = 6x2 +16, which is transformed into x3 = v'SdSôx +16.

 4 Interconnections of the solution methods and consequences

 for the casus irreducibilis

 We are now ready to take the stock of the situation. Considering the thirteen solution

 methods for cubic equations that Cardano presented in the Ars Magna, we notice that

 they are all interconnected, as clearly turns out from the diagram in Fig. 2. There I write

 'AM (chapter ) ' to refer to the solution method for the family of equations considered in
 Ars Magna, Chapter (chapter). When there are also some cases and subcases, I write,
 respectively, 'AM (chapter).(case)' and 'AM (chapter).(case).(subcase)'. These are
 numbered according to their order of appearance in Cardano's text. Note that I left
 out the cases and subcases where no cubic formula is necessary. More precisely, these
 are AM XVII. 1 and AM XVIII. 1, in which the families of equations being considered
 are reduced to χ3 = αο, and AM XV.3, AM XVII.3.i, AM XVIII.3.i, AM XIX.l, AM
 XXI. 1, AM XXII. 1, in which the families of equations being considered are reduced
 to χ3 = a\x. I have not represented the second substitution in Chapter XV (that is,
 χ — y1 — ai for x3 + aox2 = αο) either, which—as noted above—leads to a unique
 case linked to AM XII.

 In the diagram, I use two kinds of arrows. The solid ones mean that the connection

 between the two solution methods in the chapters named at its extremities is directly
 expounded in one of the solution methods themselves (more precisely, in the later
 chapter). The dotted arrow means that the connection is described elsewhere (more
 precisely, in Chapter VII). As we have seen, the connections are performed by means
 of some substitutions. Though potentially, all of Cardano's substitutions can be used
 in both directions,20 I put the head of the arrow in the same direction as Cardano
 effectively used the substitution in the Ars Magna.

 Let us take a closer look at the diagram. We observe that ultimately, all the solution

 methods are brought back to the solution methods either of the family of equations

 χ3 + a\x = ao in Chapter XI or of χ3 = a\x + ao in Chapter XII. This happens
 directly for AM XIII, AM XIV, AM XV.2, AM XVII.3.ii, AM XVIII.3.ii, XIX.2, XX,

 XXI.2, and XXII.2, and indirectly (that is, through AM XIII) for AM XV. 1, AM XVI,
 AM XVII.3.iii, AM XVin.3.iii, AM XIX.3, AM XXI.3, AM XXII.3, and AM ΧΧΠΙ.
 Moreover, an additional loose connection between AM XI and AM XII is established,

 thanks to the substitutions in Chapter VII and in AM XIV. In this way, we can best

 appreciate the extent of the difficulty set by the casus irreducibilis in the Ars Magna.

 We recall that this difficulty is only mentioned once in AM XII where Cardano, in

 order to avoid the square roots of negative numbers, needed to limit the validity of the

 rule. As we can now clearly see, this has a huge impact on the whole construction.

 The condition that Cardano set in AM XII not only undermines the generality of the

 solution method for this family of equations, but also many others are a priori affected

 by this major drawback. Indeed, in most cases, Cardano was able to reduce a cubic

 equation to one of the family x3 = a\x + ao, but then it can happen that he was not

 able to solve this last equation.

 However, there are few exceptions on the left side of the diagram, namely AM XI,

 AM XIV, AM XVII.2, and AM XVIII.2. We have already seen that the families of
 equations dealt with in AM XI and AM XIV can never fall into the casus irreducibilis.

 As a consequence, this also holds for the two cases in AM XVII and AM XVIII that

 refer to the first of these. We further note the outstanding situation of AM XIV. Even if

 Cardano also had available two substitutions in Ars Magna, Chapter VII that enable the
 connection with AM XI, its solution method is reduced to the one in AM XII, which

 is sometimes problematic.21 Unfortunately, I cannot explain why Cardano favored the

 first link over the second, especially considering that he used one of the substitutions

 in Chapter VII also in AM XV.

 5 Cardano's first attempt to put a patch in Ars Magna, Chapter XXV

 It seems to be very likely that Cardano understood that it was possible systematically

 to make vanish the square roots of negative numbers that appear while solving the
 family of equations x3 — a\x + ao in Ars Magna, Chapter XII. Possibly, he was
 aware of some cases in which one or more natural solutions of a cubic equation were

 known independently from the solution method in the Ars Magna, but in applying this

 solution method, square roots of negative numbers were returned. If we trust Tartaglia's

 account,22 Cardano asked him (unsuccessfully) for a general rule for taking the cubic
 root in cases such as V108 +TÔ = \/3 + 1 and vVl08 -IÔ = V3 - 1. We

 remark that those cubic roots are exactly the ones that the solution method in Ars

 Magna, Chapter XI returns for the equation x3 + 6x = 20 (which, by the way, is

 mentioned in Chapter XI). It is, therefore, reasonable that Cardano might also have

 thought that a similar calculation holds when, for instance, -108 instead of 108 is

 under the square root.

 21 Nevertheless, see Footnote 16.

 22 See Tartaglia (1959, Libro IX, Quesito XL, pp. 125-126).

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 271

 Speculations aside, Cardano had a few attempts at actively finding a patch for the

 difficulty entailed by the casus irreducibilis. As we have seen,23 Cardano explicitly

 acknowledged it in the 1545 Ars Magna saying that, when an equation of the family
 χ3 = a\x + ao falls into the casus irreducibilis, one should better refer to the "aliza

 question (quaestio aliza)" or to Ars Magna, Chapter XXV. Afterwards, in 1570 and

 1663 editions, only the De Régula Aliza, which appeared for the first time in 1570 as

 a published book together with the Ars Magna, is mentioned.

 Concerning the reference to the Ars Magna, in Chapter XXV, Cardano set out

 18 propositions dealing with the families of incomplete cubic equations that can fall

 into the casus irreducibilis (this is not explicitly stated, but almost all the numerical

 examples provided are in this case). In the main, he provided some ways to rewrite

 the equation at issue in the form of a system using two or more auxiliary quantities, in

 the hope that it will then be easier to find a solution. The first eight propositions deal

 with the family of equations x3 = a\x + ao. For instance,24 in the first proposition
 Cardano stated that, if

 a\ = f + g

 ao = /Vs>

 0 = -χι - xi - x3

 -a\ = *1*2 + *2*3 + *1*3

 _-O0 = -*i*2*3,

 αϊ = F + G2

 —αο = FG

 F = αϊ - G2

 G3 — αϊ G — αο = 0,

 23 See above Sect. 3.1.

 24 For a detailed account, see Confalonieri (2013, pp. 84-99). There I guess one possible origin of all these
 propositions. Let us limit to the first two propositions concerning the family of equations *3 = a\x + oq
 since the line of reasoning for the other cases is analogous. If Cardano was aware of Vieta's formulae

 he could have rewritten them as

 with G — χ ι and F = *1*2 + x\. Solving the above system is equivalent to solve

 which in turn is equivalent to solve the equation *3 = αϊ* + oq. The solutions are *1 = G, together with

 the solutions of *| + G*2 - F = 0. In the end, we get

 G G2 G G2

 *l=G, *2 = -j+y—+ F, and *3 = ---^_ + F.

 We remark that if we take F = / and G = -Jg (of course, from a modem viewpoint, these are not
 invertible substitutions, see Footnote 15), we obtain the system and the solution in the first proposition

 (where only *2 is considered since the other two solutions are always negative), and if we take F = —f and

 G = g, we obtain the system and the solution in the second proposition (where only *1, which is always
 positive, is considered).

 then a solution is χ = ^f + § + ^. In the second proposition he stated that if

 272 S. Confalonieri

 g = VôT+T

 αο = fg.

 then a solution is χ = v^l + /■ An earlier version of some of these propositions

 can be also found in Ars Magna Arithmeticae, Chapters XXXI, XXXIII, XXXV, and
 XXXVII.25

 Even if in some cases, this strategy eventually enables one to avoid the use of the
 cubic formulae, for instance for some well-chosen coefficients, this does not settle

 the difficulty at all. Indeed, being systematically able to solve these systems is as

 difficult as solving the cubic equations at issue, so that in the end, this cannot help

 in finding a theoretical solution to the difficulty entailed by the casus irreducibilis.

 However, even if the above-mentioned propositions are no step toward finding a cubic

 formula that works every time, they make explicit Cardano's willing to bypass the

 casus irreducibilis, at least by trying to put on a first temporary patch. Indeed, these

 systems can help the reader's intuition, in that they possibly provide a way of writing

 of the equation that is friendly enough to make it more easy to guess a solution. Of

 course, what 'enough' is still depends on the numerical coefficients of the equation,

 which is the reason why this is not a systematic solution.

 6 Getting acquainted with the De Régula Aliza

 According to what Cardano stated in the Ars Magna, a more effective patch to the
 casus irreducibilis should have been contained in the De Régula Aliza.26 This is a

 quite unfamiliar treatise the contents of which deserve to be better known.27

 25 See Confalonieri (2013, pp. 215-220).

 26 We have two editions of the De Régula Aliza available. The first one, printed in 1570 in Basel, is
 entitled Hieronymi Cardani mediolanensis, civisque bononiensis, medici ac mathematici praeclarissimi, de
 aliza régula, libellus, hoc est operi perfecti sui sive algebraicae logisticae, numéros recondita numerandi

 subtilitate, secundum geometricas quantitate inquirendis, necessaria coronis, nunc demum in lucem editœ.
 As said, it is coupled with the De Proportionibus and the second edition of the Ars Magna. The second
 edition of the Aliza, the title of which is simply De régula aliza libellus, is in the fourth volume of the

 1663 edition of Cardano's Opera Omnia, edited by Charles Spon almost a century after Cardano's death.

 A few miscalculations and typos are emended, and the punctuation is here and there improved, but as a

 whole, this contains no major changes compared to the first edition. As far as I know [see the website www.

 cardano.unimi.it (last checked February 14,2015] associated to the project of the edition of Cardano's works

 supported by Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Italy and by the university of Milan), no manuscript of
 the Aliza is available.

 27 Over the centuries, the Aliza had a handful of readers. Among the generations of scholars contemporary
 to Cardano, Commandino (1572, Book X, Proposition 34, Theorem III, p. 149), Stevin (1585, Book II, p.
 309), and Thomas Harriot [see Schemmel and Stedall (last checked February 14, 2015], Add. Ms. 6783,

 folio 121) studied few of its pages. It is also possible (though unlikely) that Rafael Bombelli got in touch

 with this treatise. During the nineteenth century and until the beginning of the twentieth century, Hutton

 (1812, pp. 219-224), Cantor (1892, pp. 532-537), and Loria (1950, pp. 298-299) reported on the Aliza from
 an historical viewpoint. More recently, Tanner (1980), Maracchia (2005, pp. 227, 331-335), and Stedall
 (2011, p. 10) discussed (parts of) this book.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 273

 The reader who gets acquainted with this book of Cardano's is initially disappointed:

 This is such a cryptic work, starting with the title. Indeed, the term 'aliza' is neither
 a common Latin word at that time nor was it one of the brand new mathematical

 terms that were word-by-word translations from the vernacular. Moreover, this term

 does not seem to belong to Cardano's own mathematical terminology. He does not

 even care to explain this rare word: In the whole collection of Cardano's mathematical

 writings, there are only three other occurrences,28 in addition to the title page of the

 Aliza, and they all refer to the title of the book itself. A few scholars have tried for

 an interpretation,29 but none of them provided a precise etymology. Very recently,

 Paolo D'Alessandro has confirmed Cossali's hypothesis.30 Likely, the term 'aliza', or

 'aluza', is a misspelling based on the Byzantine pronunciation alidya' of the Greek

 word 'άλυύεΐα', composed by the negative particle 'a' and by the feminine singular

 passive aorist participle of the verb 'λύω', which means 'to unbind', 'to unfasten',
 'to loosen', 'to dissolve', 'to break up', 'to undo', 'to solve'. Thus, 'aliza' means
 'non-solvable'. We remark that this etymology soundly agrees with Cardano's words

 in Ars Magna, Chapter XII (see above Sect. 3.1).

 Footnote27 continued

 As far as I know, the one scholar who studied the Aliza in detail is the Italian mathematician and historian of

 mathematics Pietro Cossali (Verona 1748, Padua 1815). He was priest in Milan, professor at the university

 of Padua, member of the Società Italiana delle Scienze, and pensionnaire of the Reale Istituto Italiano di

 Scienze, Lettere e Arti. Mostly the Aliza, as well as the Ars Magna Arithmeticae, were handled on the same

 footing as the Ars Magna in the second volume of his history of algebra (see Cossali 1799a) and in the
 Storia del Caso Irriducibile (see Cossali 1966, which is the commented transcription by Romano Gatto of

 the unpublished manuscript). Nevertheless, it must be said that for the most of the time, Cossali's accuracy

 as historian is not up to modem standards: He was doing mathematics from a historical starting point rather
 than history of mathematics. Indeed, Cossali was a mathematician, and this could partially explain his
 attitude.

 In 1781, the Academy of Padua announced a competition to prove either that the cubic formula could be

 freed from imaginary numbers or the contrary, but in the end, the prize was never assigned. However, this
 renewed mathematicians' interest in the casus irreducibilis. Cossali was absorbed by this topic [his very
 first work in 1799 is devoted to it, and in 1813, he came back to the same issue, see Cossali (1799b) and

 Cossali (1813)]. He also wanted to take part in the 1781 competition, but he could not finish his contribution
 on time; he subsequently published it in 1782 (see Cossali 1782).

 28 In chronological order, we have already seen the first reference in Ars Magna, Chapter XII in Sect. 3.1.

 Unfortunately, the other occurrences step outside the context of cubic equations. The second reference is in

 the 1554 De subtilitate (and following editions), where Cardano dealt with the "reflexive ratio (proponio

 reflexa)", see Cardano (1554, Book XVI, p. 428). The last reference is in the Sermo de plus et minus, which

 contains a specific mention of the Aliza, Chapter XXII, see Cardano (1663a, p. 435). Thereafter the term is
 mentioned nowhere else.

 29 In 1799 Pietro Cossali hinted that the term 'aliza' means '(insolvable' : "De Régula Aliza, cioè De régula
 Irresolubili", see Cossali (1799a, volume II, p. 441) or Cossali (1966, Chapter I, Paragraph 2, p. 26). In

 1892 Moritz Cantor related that Armin Wittstein suggests that this term comes from a wrong transcription
 of the Arabic word 'a'izzâ' and means 'difficult to do', 'laborious', 'arduous': "Titel De régula Aliza,
 der durch unrichtige Transkription aus dem arabischen Worte a'izzâ (schwierig anzustellen, miihselig,

 beschwerlich) entstanden sein kann [Diese Vermutung riihrt von H. Armin Wittstein her.], und alsdann Regel

 der schwierigen Fdlle bedeuten wiirde", see Cantor (1892, p. 532). Finally in 1929, Gino Loria advanced as
 a common opinion that the term comes from a certain Arabic word that means 'difficult': "il titolo, sinora
 inesplicato De Régula Aliza (seconde alcuni aliza deriverebbe da una parola araba significante difficile)",

 see Loria (1950, p. 298).

 274 S. Confalonieri

 The Aliza is composed of 60 highly sketchy chapters. In the 1570 edition, it fills up

 111 folia. The chapters vary considerably in length, from half a folio up to six or seven

 folia. They all have their own heading and sometimes display an inner organization.

 At least one diagram is present in each chapter and sometimes also a table where the

 calculation at issue is displayed. In the margins and in the text, we find a good number

 of references, pointing in most cases at the Aliza itself or at the two other treatises,

 the Ars Magna and the De Proportionibus, that appeared in the same joined edition.

 There are also many references to Euclid's Elements,31 one reference to the Conies by

 Apollonius, and one reference to the On the sphere and cylinder by Archimedes. Even

 though Cardano claims that none of his works were rewritten less than three times,32

 the Aliza seems not to have enjoyed this benefit. Probably, Cardano barely proofread

 the text or proofread it very quickly. However, common the typos and mistakes in

 calculations were at the time; the book is particularly full of them. In addition to this,

 we must recall that Cardano did not write a simple Latin. Even more noteworthy, it

 is quite hard to detect an inner structure in the treatise—it would be better to say

 that there is no global structure at all. A topic is usually scattered throughout the

 book, with repetitions and logical gaps, so that in the end, the reader feels highly
 disoriented. Under these conditions, the Aliza is more pragmatically to be regarded

 not as a unitary treatise but as a miscellany of mathematical writings, notes, remarks,

 and observations. Its raison d'être, as the author himself said in the Ars Magna, is

 to overcome the difficulty entailed by the casus irreducibilis. This is fundamental in

 order to understand how Cardano may have considered the Aliza, that is, a treatise to

 amend the Ars Magna.

 Dating the Aliza miscellany, even if approximately, is a thorny task. We cannot trust

 the (supposedly) chronological order in which the treatises are displayed in the fourth
 volume of the 1663 Opera Omnia. It Aliza comes immediately after the Ars Magna

 Arithmeticae, which in turn follows the Ars Magna, but these last two treatises are

 listed in the wrong order (see Gavagna 2012).33 In Cardano's mathematical treatises,
 the Aliza is first mentioned—as we have seen—in the 1545 Ars Magna (see above

 Sect. 3.1). This means that Cardano had in mind a certain "aliza problem" around

 1545—which makes sense since he already had to came across the casus irreducibilis

 developing the cubic formulae in the Ars Magna Arithmeticae and in the Ars Magna.
 Some other hints can be found in Cardano's nonmathematical treatises and more

 precisely in the 1544, 1550, 1557, 1562, and 1576 versions of his autobiography.

 There Cardano recalled his personal life, but also his career and his writings. He set

 down in particular the titles, sizes, incipit, contents, and the main topics of all of his

 treatises. The Aliza as a published book is, of course, mentioned only once, in 1576.34

 31 It is very likely that the edition that Cardano had at hand was the one by Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples printed

 in Paris in 1516. Indeed, it was explicitly mentioned by Cardano in the short preface to the manuscript
 Commentantι in Euclidis Elementa (see Gavagna 2003, p. 134). An accurate study to determine whether

 Cardano followed Campano or rather Zamberti's interpretation is still lacking.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 275

 For our purposes, it is however interesting to consider, among the listed writings, the

 Opus Arithmeticae Perfectum. This should have been an encyclopedic work on math

 ematics, composed of fourteen books, and was probably conceived between the 1530s

 and the 1560s, but it was never realized. Today, all we have is Cardano's description

 in his autobiography. In 1544, he wrote that "the tenth [book of the Opus Arithmeticae

 Perfectum] has written Ars magna on it [and] contains 67 chapters (decimus inscribitur

 Ars magna, continet sexaginta septem capitula)",35 whereas Books XIII and XIV "are

 dedicated to the arithmetical and geometrical questions (quaestionibus arithmeticis et

 geometricis destinantur)" 36 The Aliza is not explicitly mentioned, but according to

 the quotation from the 1545 Ars Magna where the "aliza question" is coupled with

 a certain "book on geometrical questions", it should be associated to a certain geo

 metrical problem in the last book of the Opus Arithmeticae Perfectum. In 1550, Book

 X came to be devoted to "all the chapters on the quadratic [equations] with the aliza

 rule (omnia capitula supra quadratum cum régula aliza)",31 Book XIV still concerned

 geometry, but was restricted "to what pertain the measure of figures that are called

 geometrical (ad mensuram figurarum pertinentia, quae geometrica vocantur)",38 and

 any reference to the Ars Magna disappeared. From 1557 on, the Aliza is no longer

 mentioned, so the 1544 state of affairs is restored.39 Finally, in 1576, Cardano said

 that in 1568, he had joined the Aliza and the De Proportionibus to the Ars Magna and

 sent them to the printers.40 Therefore, a certain "aliza" was first mentioned in 1545

 (but we can reasonably stretch this time limit up to 1544) and sank into oblivion after
 1557.

 We can conjecture that the miscellany of writings that compose the Aliza (or their
 original core) was first conceived at worst between 1544 and 1545 around the casus

 irreducibilis and a certain "geometrical question". From that moment on, the topic at

 issue grew more and more in importance and attained its culmination around 1550,

 when the Aliza replaced the Ars Magna in the plan of the Opus Arithmeticae Perfectum.

 Twenty years later, the Aliza surfaced again and was published. It is still an open
 question why Cardano decided to publish it. The changes in the editorial project of

 the Opus Arithmeticae Perfectum could, therefore, attest to Cardano's hope of finding

 35 See Cardano (1544, p. 426). This quotation raises the incidental question of how to know what that "Ars

 magna" was of which Cardano is speaking because all the editions that we have with that title have only
 forty chapters. Tamborini (2003, pp. 178-179), Ian Maclean in Cardano (2004, p. 65), and Gavagna (2012)
 discuss this incongruity, and I refer to them for an accurate discussion.

 36 See Cardano (1544, p. 426).

 37 See Cardano (1998, p. 9v).

 38 See Cardano (1998, p. 9v).

 39 Indeed, "[djecimus de regulis magnis, atque ideo ars magna vacatur: atque hie solus ex omnibus editus

 est" and "[tjertiusdecimus quaestiones arithmeticas, ut quartusdecimus geometricas", see Cardano (1557,
 pp. 37-38) and Cardano (1562, p. 16).

 40 "Depwportionibus, etaliza régula addidi anno MDLXVIIIadlibrum artis magnae etedidi", see Cardano
 (1663b, p. 41).

 This agrees with what Ercole Bottrigari (1531-1612) wrote in his Ια mascara overo dellafabbrica de teatri

 e dello apparato delle scene tragisatirocomiche: "two or three years" before 1570, Bottrigari questioned
 Cardano about the Aliza and Cardano, avoiding answering, dropped that the Aliza was going to be printed
 in Germany. The reference can be found in Betti (2009, p. 163), and I thank Veronica Gavagna for it.

 some new results relating to the casus irreducibilis. The lapse of time during which

 only th e Aliza appeared as a part of the Opus Arithmeticae Perfectum could in particular

 correspond to the lapse of time during which Cardano believed that he would have

 eventually manage to avoid the casus irreducibilis, namely to the few years from 1550

 to (at the latest) 1557. However, when the Aliza was printed in 1570, its inner title

 page recalled its origins as a question since it contains the term dibellus', which means

 'pamphlet', 'booklet', 'small book': not substantial enough at that time to replace the

 Ars Magna. Moreover, in the light of the quotation in Sect. 3.1, we remark that the

 Aliza likely arose around a certain delimited problem and then grew bigger and bigger

 until it became a book in 1570. This could (at least partially) explain the lack of order

 in its structure. It would be extremely useful to be able to provide a relative chronology

 of the pieces that compose the miscellany. Unluckily, this can only be achieved locally
 here and there.41

 7 The method of splittings in Aliza, Chapter I

 Having set the context for this unfamiliar treatise, we are now ready to deal with the

 one widespread thread in it. The Aliza being a miscellany, it is not surprising that

 the techniques that it contains are not systematically organized. We rather see how

 Cardano groped his way forward and find some attempts in different directions, such

 as, for instance, a proof in a geometrical style of the existence of a solution for the

 family of equations x3 = a\x + ao or an alternative sign rule for multiplication by

 means of which Cardano had hoped (unsuccessfully) eventually to avoid imaginary

 numbers in the formulae. The importance of the Aliza also lies in the fact that it shows
 how Cardano was accustomed to deal with equations, which does not appear in his

 other algebraic treatises.

 The pattern to which Cardano accorded the most credit which is widespread in

 the Aliza42 is what I call splittings. This term is a word-by-word translation from the
 Italian 'spezzamenti' that Cossali devised (see Cossali 1799a; Cossali 1966). As we
 have seen in Sect. 4, all the solution methods for cubic equations in the Ars Magna

 are reduced to the solution methods either for the family of equations χ3 + a\x = ao

 or for x3 = a\x + ao. This correspond to Cardano's description in the first lines of the

 De Régula Aliza, where he argued as follows.

 Since I have already demonstrated in the Ars Magna that all the chapters are

 transformed, provided that the two principal [chapters] had been discovered [to

 be] general and not by transformation, it is plain that having discovered another

 general chapter in addition to the chapter of the cube and some things equal to

 a number and [to the chapter] of the cube equal to some squares and a num

 ber, which is deduced by transformation from the preceding [one], even if [the

 other general chapter] was general; all the chapters either of three or of four

 terms would not only be known in general, but also demonstrated, provided that

 41 For more details, see Confalonieri (2013, p. 235).

 42 This pattern is dealt with directly in Chapters I, II, VII, Χ, XVIII, XLV, XLVI, XLVIII, LUI, LX, and

 indirectly in many others.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 277

 this very same [chapter] is discovered by a demonstration. (Cum iam in arte

 magna demonstraverimus omnia capitula converti, modo duo principalia nec

 iam ex conversione inventa generaliafuerint, manifestum est, invento alio capit

 ulo generali, praeter capitula cubi et rerum œqualium numéro et cubi aequalis

 quadratis et numéro, quod ex priore per conversionem deducitur, et si generate

 sit, omnia capita seu ex tribus seu ex quatuor nominibus generaliter non solum

 cognita esse, sed et demonstrata, modo hoc ipsum demonstratione inventum sit),

 see Cardano (1570b, Chapter I, p. 1). This is the sole declaration of intent that can be

 found in the entire Aliza, and significantly, Cardano put it in the very first paragraph

 of the book. It is an issue, though, to understand its meaning clearly. I interpret the

 term 'chapter' as generously as possible: Everything that concerns the solution of a

 certain family of equations, even in a loose way, so that the statement of the equation

 itself, the numerical examples, the corollaries, and a fortiori the solution method are

 addressed by this term. In the quotation, an overall recurrent strategy to deal with the

 casus irreducibilis is explained. Since all the solution methods are linked, one should

 look for a family of equations the solution method of which is generally proved, that

 is, it works for every numerical equation that belongs to that family. According to our

 analysis of the Ars Magna, the "two principal chapters" mentioned in the quotation

 are χ3 + a\x = ao and *3 = a\x + a0- Cardano specified that the family of equation

 sought for should not be x3+a\x = ao or x3 = α2Χ2+ao (this last family being linked

 to the first one by substitution, see the above Fig. 2). Indeed, we have seen that, even

 if these two families of equations can never fall into the casus irreducibilis, still the

 difficulty entailed by it can be displayed in other families, primarily in χ3 = a\x +αο·

 This is why Cardano devoted the rest of Chapter I (and many other passages) to it.
 Let us consider the family of equations χ3 = αιχ + ao and substitute χ = y + z.

 Developing the calculations, we come to the equality

 y3 + 3y2z + 3 yz2 + z3 = ai(y + z) + ao

 This is what Cardano implicitly did in the paragraphs of Aliza, Chapter I that follow the

 quotation. Afterwards, his strategy is to arrange the left hand side y3+3y2z+3y z2+z3

 of the equality as the sum of two parts both of which are going to be matched either

 to ai(y + z) or to ao on the right hand side. We remark that choosing one of the

 two assignments; for instance, the one for ao completely determines the choice for

 the other. Whenever possible (that is, when the polynomial assigned to ai (y + ζ) can

 be divided by y + ζ without remainder), Cardano also matched this term directly to

 the given coefficient αι. The name 'splitting' is appropriate since the left side of the

 equality is split in two parts. At first, Cardano considered extensively the splittings in

 the following seven propositions.

 All "[T]he number is assigned to the cubes [...], and the things themselves are

 equal to the six parallelepipeds that remain (numerus tribuatur cubis [...] et res ipsce

 cequantur parallelipedis sex)", that is,

 a0 = y3 + z3

 aix = 3y2z + 3yz2.

 , , , or

 ao = z3

 a\x = 3y ζ + 3yz2 + z3

 aix = y3 + 3y2z + 3yz2.

 43 The first sentence in the description identifies three possible splittings, namely

 ao = 2 γ2 ζ + 2 yz2

 ao = y2z + 3 yz2

 ao = 3y2z + yz2

 a\x = y3 + y2z + yz2 + z3

 at* = y3 +2y2z + Z3

 a\x = y3 + 2yz2 + z3

 The second sentence definitely points at the first splitting since only the following proportion holds

 (y3 + y2z + yz2 + z3) : (2y2z + 2yz2) = y2 + z2 : 2yz.

 44 The numerical example that follows this description enables to clarify what a "connected" parallelepiped

 (to a cube) is. More generally (using the same formalism as above), in the Aliza, a parallelepiped y2z is

 "connected (coherens, proximum)" to the cube y3, a parallelepiped yz2 is "opposite (adversum, alternum,
 altrinsecum, remotum)" to the cube y3, and the two parallelepipeds y2z and yz2 are "mutual (mutua)".

 45 We remark that as long as one do not put any further condition on y, z, they are a priori interchangeable

 in Cardano's phrasing. For example, the expression 'one cube' addresses both y3 and z3, or 'one cube and
 one opposite parallelepiped' addresses both y3 + yz2 and z3 + y2z. A few splittings, namely the ones
 where the assignation for ao (and for αιχ) are symmetrical in y, z, are defined in a univocal way. This is
 the case for instance in A 11—A 14. For the sake of clarity, I choose in the other cases to explicitly write

 all the combinations of y, z.

 7.1 The splitting in A I 1

 Let us consider more in details the splittings in the proposition All. Referring to
 Fig. 3, Cardano stated the following condition:

 since the cubes of Α β and BC can never be smaller than one-fourth of the whole

 cube AD, and indeed, this does not happen except when AC will be divided in
 equal [parts] by B\ therefore, being the number smaller than one-fourth of the

 whole cube AD, it will not be able to be equal to the cubes of AB, ΒC (quoniam
 cubi ab et be nunque possunt esse minores quarta parte totius cubi ad, et hoc

 etiam non contingit nisi cumfuerit ac divisa per œqualia in b. Cum igitur numerus
 fuerit minor quadrante cubi totius ad, non poterit cequari cubis ab, be)

 and added that "the chapter is not general in this part (capitulum hac in parte non
 fuit generale)". Let us call AB — y and BC = z. The condition implies that, if

 280 S. Confalonieri

 y + ζ — x (where * is a solution of χ3 = a\x + αο), since y3 + ζ3 > ^χ3, then it
 must be

 1 3
 αο > -Χ
 Α

 Cardano's justification is rather vague.46 First of all, we remark that by the formula

 for the cube of a binomial, we can immediately derive a condition on a\x, given the

 condition on αο. More precisely, the inequality y3 + ζ3 > ^x3 implies a condition

 on the sign of the discriminant47 We, moreover, remark that the second line of the

 splitting can be rewritten as αϊ = 3 y ζ and therefore, that the splitting itself is basically

 the system from Ars Magna, Chapter XII (see above). Not surprisingly, it turns out that

 if one knows the splitting in A 11, it should also be able to derive the cubic formula

 for x3 = αϊ jc + αο since there are no major conceptual gaps to be filled: A calculation

 that involves a quadratic equation is enough. Given the resemblances with the Ars

 Magna, it seems extremely unlikely that Cardano was not aware of the link with the

 already expounded solution method for the family of equations under consideration.

 This splitting can be seen in truth as a reformulation of Cardano's solution method for

 jc3 = a\x + αο in the Ars Magna. From this point of view, the condition αο > |x3
 is nothing other than a translation of the condition (on the discriminant) that Cardano

 added there in Chapter XII.

 46 In the margin, Cardano made reference to "the 9th [Proposition] of the second [Book] of Euclid" and

 to "some dialectic rules ([p]er 9 secundi Elementorum et régula Dialec.)". Note that both 1570 and 1663
 editions have 'régula'. Since the preposition 'per' takes the accusative case, we would have expected to
 find either 'regulam' or 'régulas', which is not the case. Therefore, I have chosen to translate this term in

 the plural to leave the interpretation as loose as possible. The mention of the 'dialectic rules' seems to be a

 blurry reference to some classical logical rules. Cardano also wrote a Dialectica, printed in 1566 in Basel [in

 the second volume of Cardano (1566)], which is a logic treatise where the rules are sometimes expounded

 through mathematical examples. Since Elements 11.9 (both in Campano's and Zamberti's versions) implies

 that y2 + ζ2 > jx2, we are searching for one or more rules that enable to pass from the inequality with
 the squares to the inequality with the cubes, but I could find none in the Dialectica. It is nevertheless not

 hard to derive it by hand.

 Note, moreover, that in order to verify the inequality ag > |x3, we must assume both y and ζ are positive.
 Indeed, let us suppose for a contradiction that y > 0 and ζ < 0, for example, y = 1 and ζ = -2. Then,
 -7 < which contradicts y3 +z3 > ^x3.

 47 The condition yields to the following system

 which in turn entails that

 ao > \*3
 a\ < !*2,

 ι .2 > l ( l T3\
 ί ο - ? U j

 a\ < (fx2)3

 that is Yja\ < ^χ6 < \a^. Then, - γjaj > 0, or Ay > 0.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 281

 Cossali maintained—very reasonably—that this splitting came directly from
 Tartaglia's poem (see above Footnote 11) and that, once discovered it, Cardano looked

 for other similar splittings.48

 7.2 The splittings in A12-A17

 3 3 1 3 1 3
 «0 < ~.x > ao < zx'. ao < τ* ·
 4 2 4

 We now consider the remaining splittings. Cardano also stated analogous conditions

 for A12-A 14. Namely, with regard to ao, the conditions, respectively, are

 These conditions delimit, for each splitting, a range of validity complementary to the

 one for A11. Concerning in particular A12, Cardano himself remarked that "since

 neither the first [All] nor the second [A 12] of these chapters can be general by itself,

 nevertheless, both of them joined constitute a general chapter ([c]um ergo neutrum

 istorum capitulorum possit esse generate per se, ambo tamen iuncta constituit49 capit

 ulum generate)". In my interpretation, especially considering the link between All

 and the solution method in Ars Magna, Chapter XII, Cardano was eventually looking

 for a complementary solution method, that is, for a solution method, for the same

 equation that holds when one cannot apply the one in Ars Magna, Chapter XII. The

 privileged way to discover this new solution method is passing by another splitting.

 Hopefully, this could have also led to a complementary formula.

 Let us now consider A I 5, AI 6, and A 17. Cardano gave no condition50 on the

 splittings here, but he called the one in A15 "the worst of all (deterius omnibus)" and

 the ones in A16 and A17 "misshaped (difformia)". These expressions are justified as

 follows. With regard to A15, Cardano observed that "it falls back on a chapter of four

 terms, thence from that to the principal [redit ad capitulum quatuor nominum, inde ex

 eo ad primum]". Indeed, if we try to solve the system in y, z, we bump into a complete

 equation that falls into the casus irreducibilis. Deleting the second degree term thanks

 to one of the substitutions that Cardano knew, we recover again an equation of the
 family x3 = a\x + ao- With regard to A I 6 (and this also holds for A I 7), Cardano

 remarked that "similar [similia]" aggregates, as the cube and three parallelepipeds like

 in y3 + 3 y ζ2 and 3 y2 ζ + ζ3, are made equal to "dissimilar [dissimilia]" ones, as the

 number ao and the things a\x. According to Cardano's reasoning, since none of the
 splittings in A I 5-A I 7 is subject to a condition, if one could conceive a solution

 method starting from one of them, this would be general and could replace the one in
 All.

 48 "Giusta il metodo di Tartaglia questa equazione (y 3 + 3y2z + 3y z2 + Z3 - p(y + z) - q = 0) si spezza
 nelle due y3 + z3 = q, 3y2z + 3y z2 = p(y + z). È egli di natura sua generate questo spezzamento? È
 egli l'unico? E qui stendendo Cadano lo sguardo su le varie combinazioni de' termini, moltissimi gli si

 presentarono alla mente i suppostipossibili afarsi", see Cossali (1966, Chapter I, Paragraph 3, pp. 27-28).

 49 The 1663 edition has "constituunt".

 50 Obviously it is not true that—strictly speaking—no condition on oq is entailed. Indeed, there is at least

 the trivial condition ao < x3 given by the equation *3 = a\x + «ο itself. Therefore, we better account for
 Cardano's "no condition" as "no non-trivial condition".

 282 S. Confalonieri

 Unfortunately, the difficulty with the splittings in A 1 2-A I 7 (and actually with

 any other splitting) is exactly that one cannot conceive a solution method for the

 considered equation starting from them. Indeed, they all lead to equations (namely, to

 the equations in one unknown associated to the systems in the splittings) that are never

 of a lower degree than three.51 Therefore, they cannot be used to derive a solution for

 the family of equations χ3 = a\x + ao, as was instead the case for All.

 7.3 The other splittings

 In the first seven splittings, which Cardano addressed as the "easiest (faciliora)", he

 was possibly trying to derive, albeit unsuccessfully, either a solution method comple

 mentary to A11 or an alternative one. It is natural then to wonder on the basis of what

 criteria did Cardano choose to describe in details the splittings A12-A 17.

 According to Cardano's requirements (that is, always considering positive coeffi

 cients and writing no equality with zero), there are 62 possible splittings. To count

 them all, we recall that splitting y3 + 3y2z + 3yz3 + z3 in two parts and assigning one

 to ao, completely determines the choice for the part assigned to a\x. We consider then

 all the possible combinations of the eight terms in y3 + 3y2ζ + 3yz3 + ζ3. We have

 two choices for each term y3, z3 (since we can have one or none of them) and four

 choices for each term y2z, yz2 (since we can have three, two, one, or none of them

 and we cannot distinguish them three by three). Moreover, we have to exclude the two

 limit cases, where all the terms or no term are assigned to ao· The most effective way

 to classify the combinations is on the basis of how many terms are associated to ao as

 in Table 2. Note that the dotted line points to the y, z-symmetry axis. For the sake of

 brevity, in Table 21 omit the terms assigned to α ι χ. We remark anyway that one can also

 directly read them in the table. For instance, when one term of y3 + 3y2z + 3yz3 -I- z3

 is associated to ao, seven terms remain for a\x, and they are exactly the ones listed

 in the seven-term column for ao. In the same way, the two-term column is associated
 to the six-term column, the three-term column is associated to the five-term column,
 and the four-term column is associated with itself.

 At the very end of Aliza, Chapter I Cardano briefly listed (some of) the remaining

 splittings.

 The remaining compositions are anomalous, as if we had given the number to

 one parallelepiped, to three [parallelepipeds], to five [parallelepipeds], to two

 [parallelepipeds] non-mutual, to four [parallelepipeds] two of which are non

 mutual, or again to one cube and one parallelepiped, [to one cube and] to two

 [parallelepipeds] or [to one cube and] to three [parallelepipeds] not of the same

 kind. The others are useless, as if we had given the number to the aggregate from

 both cubes and two or four parallelepipeds in whatever way ("[r]eliquce autem

 compositiones aut52 sunt anomale, velut si daremus numerum uni parallelipedo,

 51 See Confalonieri (2013, pp. 254-255).

 52 Its correlative 'aut' has been omitted and was—in my understanding—originally referred to "inutiles"

 in the next sentence. Moreover, it was common at that time to mix up 'vel' and 'aut' especially in listing,

 which should have happened in the two lists referred to the anomalous and useless splittings.

 see Cardano (1570b, Chapter I, p. 4). Among the "anomalous" splittings Cardano

 mentioned, in this order, the splittings determined by the following assignations:

 ao = y2z, ao = yz2,

 a0 = 3 y2z, a0 = 3 yz2,

 ao = y2z + 2 yz2, a0 = 2 y2z + yz2,

 ao = 3y2z + 2yz2, ao = 2y2z + 3yz2,

 ao = 2 y2z, ao = 2 yz2

 ao = y2z + 3yz2, a0 = 3y2z + yz2,

 ao = y3 + y2z, ao = yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + yz2, a0 = y2z + z3

 ao = y3 + y2z +yz2, ao = y2z + yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 2y2z, ao = 2yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 2 yz2, ao = 2 y2z + z3

 ao = y3 + 2 y2z + yz2 (A 17), ao = y2z + 2 yz2 + ζ3 (A 17),

 ao = y3 + y2z+ 2yz2, ao = 2y2z + yz2 + z3·

 Note that I interpret "four [parallelepipeds] two of which are non-mutual" in the

 previous quotation as pointing only to the splittings determined by ao = y2z + 3yz2
 and ao = 3y2z + yz2, but not to the one in A13 determined by ao = 2y2z + 2yz2.
 Indeed, taking into account four parallelepipeds, the expression 'two of which are non

 mutual' is superfluous since Cardano had only six parallelepipeds available that are
 three by three of the same kind. In my interpretation, Cardano added this expression

 to distinguish these splittings from the one in A13. Moreover, in "[as if we had given

 the number to one cube and] to two [parallelepipeds] or [to one cube and] to three

 [parallelepipeds] not of the same kind" I loosely interpret "not of the same kind" to
 refer only to "three [parallelepipeds]" but not to "two [parallelepipeds]". We finally

 remark that, since the splittings in A I 7 also appear above, the labels 'misshaped'

 and 'anomalous' are not exclusive. According to Cardano's description, the splittings
 determined by the assignations ao = y3 + y2z + 2yz2 and ao = 2y2z + yz2 +
 z3 are also misshaped. We have no hint as to why Cardano called these splittings

 'anomalous'. I would tend toward a literal interpretation of 'anomalus' as 'without

 name', meaning that it was not worthwhile giving a name to those splittings. Of course,

 this interpretation leaves open the question of why Cardano decided not to give a name

 to these splittings.

 Among the "useless" splittings Cardano mentioned, in this order, the splittings

 determined by the following assignations:

 ao = y3 + y2z + yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 2y2z + z3, ao = y3 + 2yz2 + z3,

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 285

 ao = y3 + 3y2z + yz2 + ζ3, ao = y3 + y2z + ïyz2 + ζ3,

 ao = y3 + ly2z + 2 y ζ2 + ζ3.

 In the last sentence of Aliza, Chapter I, Cardano added a crucial observation. With

 regard to the useless splittings, he argued that

 if it [the number ao] is not enough for the aggregate of the cubes since the

 number is small, in what way is it enough for the same if the parallelepipeds

 are added? (nam si numerus cum parvus sit, non sufficit aggregato cuborum,

 quomodo sufficit eidem si addantur parallelipeda),

 see Cardano (1570b, Chapter I, p. 4). This is a key sentence for making sense of the

 splittings. In the Ars Magna (and in A11), Cardano assumed that ao = y3 + z3, and

 as a consequence, he needed to put the condition on y3 + z3-or, more precisely, on

 ao—in which he asked that this number be large. In the Aliza, Cardano was trying

 to fix this difficulty. As we have argued, it is very reasonable that he was looking for

 some splittings where the condition was not satisfied, that is, where the number ao is

 small, hoping that they could lead to another solution method (either to complement

 or to replace the one in A11). This is the reason why Cardano called the above four

 splittings useless: there, the number ao is greater than in A11 since it is equal to the

 two cubes y3 and z3 plus some other parallelepipeds (and we recall that ao = y3 + z3

 was already too large). In the list of the useless splittings, Cardano did not include the

 ones determined by the following assignments:

 «ο = y3+ y2z + z3, ao = y3 + yz2 + z3,

 do = y3 + y2z + 2 yz2 + z3, ao = y3 + 2 y2z + yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 3y2z + z3, a0 = y3 + 3yz2 + z3,

 do = y3 + 3y2z + 2 yz2 + z3, ao = y3 + 2 y2z + 3 yz2 + z3.

 Actually there is no doubt that they should have been included because there also the

 number is made equal to the two cubes y3 and z3 plus some other parallelepipeds, that

 is, positive quantities.

 According to the above interpretation, in Aliza, Chapter I forty-eight splittings are

 mentioned in all. In almost all the remaining ones, ao is matched with five, six, or seven

 terms among which there is always one (and only one) cube. The splitting determined
 by the assignation ao = y3 + 3y2z and its symmetrical ao = 3yz2 4- z3 are the

 exception since ao is matched with relatively few terms. We remark that indeed there

 is a striking correspondence between them and the splittings in A I 6: the first ones

 involve one cube and its "connected" parallelepipeds while the ones in A16 involve

 one cube and its "opposite" parallelepipeds (see Footnote 44). They seem, therefore,

 to be similar in a way to the splittings in53 A16. In the end, twelve splittings remained
 unmentioned:

 53

 By the way, according to Cardano's description, these are all misshaped splittings.

 286 S. Confalonieri

 ao = y3 + y2z + 3yz2, ao = 3y2z +yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 3y2z + yz2, ao = y2z + 3yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 2 y2 ζ + 2yz2, ao = ly2z + 2yz2 + z3,

 ao = y3 + 2y2z + 3yz2, ao = 3y2z + 2yz2+ z3,

 ao = y3 + 3 y2z + 2 yz2, ao = 2y2z + 3 yz2 + z3

 ao = y3 + 3 y2z + 3 yz2, ao = 3 y2z + 3yz2 + z3.

 My hypothesis is that these are not mentioned because Cardano believed that they

 were in an obvious way uninteresting. Obvious' could mean that, as in the case of

 the useless splittings, ao is matched with a quantity that is too large compared to
 y3 + ζ3. Indeed, assuming y ζ, we can immediately discard half of the above
 splittings, namely the ones with z3, as the quantity assigned to ao is too large. But the

 six splittings where y3 appears are also too large since we are interested in a (very)

 small ao and we choose ζ arbitrarily large (for instance such that 3y2z + 3yz2 > z3).

 If this interpretation holds, it also sheds a posteriori a new light on the splittings in

 A12-A17. Indeed, in the whole Aliza, Chapter I, Cardano could have been adopting

 the criterion of "a small ao". This is explicit in the case of the useless splittings.

 Moreover, we have already argued that, in A I 2-A I 4, Cardano was looking for a

 solution method the condition of validity of which is complementary to the ones in

 All. There, he found that the quantities matched with ao were relatively small (this is

 what is stated in the conditions). It seems, therefore, very likely that Cardano continued

 listing splittings in which ao complies with the above criterion, and A15-A17 fits it.

 At best, Cardano could hope to find, thanks to a fortunate splitting, a solution method to

 replace the one in A11, and this would have been the case if this hypothetical splitting

 had no conditions; at worst, he could hope for a complementary solution method.

 8 Conclusions

 In the Ars Magna, Cardano provided a highly systematic procedure for solving cubic

 equations, but he did not succeed in strongly grounding the whole construction. The

 overview that we have given of the connections between all the solution methods
 lets us take the stock of the situation. First of all, we notice that the substitutions are

 a privileged method for Cardano to deal with equations. Unfortunately, they do not

 have a heuristic value, so that it is extremely difficult to say which kind of reasoning

 they come from. The overview that we have given makes clear how the difficulty

 entailed by the casus irreducibilis, which in Cardano's text seems to concern only

 one family of equations, is in truth inherited by most of the families. As such, this
 becomes a fundamental issue and must be overcome, if one wants to have general
 solution methods.

 Cardano planned to deal with this difficulty in two ways. On the one hand, in the

 Ars Magna itself, he gave a handful of propositions for putting a temporary patch

 in some particular cases. This is, however, no step toward finding a general solution

 theoretically.

 The casus irreducibilis in Cardano's Ars Magna 287

 On the other hand, the De Régula Aliza is referred to as the treatise that should

 have permanently corrected the problem. Due to its many inconsistencies, this is

 a quite unfamiliar treatise. It comes from a project that gradually grew bigger and

 bigger and likely attained its summit around 1550. Nevertheless the treatise was not

 printed until 1570, by which time probably Cardano no longer hoped to overcome the

 difficulty entailed by the casus irreducibilis. A peculiar topic in the Aliza is the so

 called splittings for the family of equations χ3 = a\x + oq. These seem to be the way

 that Cardano trusted most, and they are present all through the treatise. The idea is to

 use the substitution χ = y+z in the family of equations at issue and to split the equality

 thus obtained by different assignments of its terms to the given coefficients. It is likely

 that Cardano was exploring all the possible assignments to oq. He first considered the

 splitting that allows the cubic formula to be altered since it bears a condition on ao,

 namely that ao must be large. Afterwards, Cardano displayed some splittings (with

 or without conditions) where the number ao is small. Eventually he was hoping to

 derive from one of these splittings another solution method for χ3 = αϊ* + αο· If the

 splitting that possibly lead to the solution method had a condition, Cardano would have

 obtained a technique that complemented the cubic formula since it would have been

 valid where the cubic formula fails. If the splitting that possibly lead to the solution

 method had no condition, Cardano would have obtained an alternative technique, and

 if possible an alternative cubic formula. In both cases, the difficulty entailed by the
 casus irreducibilis would have been solved.

 Unluckily for him, this was impossible. Nowadays we know that when a cubic

 equation has three real different solutions imaginary numbers cannot be avoided in
 the formula. This also means that, in certain cases, Cardano could not have found a

 way to express the solutions without square roots of negative numbers. Still, the Aliza

 deserves to be better known inasmuch as it shows in what ways Cardano was used to

 deal with equations. This is especially true when it was a matter of overcoming the

 difficulty presented by the solution methods for cubic equations that he had found.
