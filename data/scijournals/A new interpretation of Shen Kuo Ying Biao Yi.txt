 Abstract This article analyzes the method of orienting a gnomon developed by the

 eleventh century Chinese scientist Shen Kuo and described in his Ying Biao Yi. I argue
 that Shen Kuo's criticism of the traditional orientation method was built on his belief

 that the earth is flat. The method Shen Kuo presented aims first to find the center of

 the earth, and only then to orient the gnomon to the cardinal directions. In addition,

 Shen Kuo developed two new techniques for improving observation with a gnomon:
 the first method sets the gnomon in a closed chamber with only a small slit for the

 entrance of the noon sunlight, thereby reducing ambient light and making it easier to

 see the gnomon's shadow. Shen's other innovation is to use a second gnomon together
 with the first. This can greatly weaken the shadow's penumbra.

 1 Introduction

 Shen Kuo žfcS is one of the most famous scientists of the Song Dynasty and
 among the most important figures in the history of science in China. The astronom-

 ical treatise of the Songshi 5fe& dynastic history calls Shen Kuo "knowledgeable

 and good at the literary arts. He mastered astronomy, local chronicles, musi-
 cal harmonics, the calendar, medicine and divination, and left works in all these

 fields." (fiWMÄ, T*Ä* £*, mm. SIŘ, ff*. **, fcflr^FÄ, WfrBrlMr,). Sivin (1975)

 describes Shen Kuo as "the most exceptional of the polymathic statesmen who flour-

 ished in the eleventh century."

 Shen Kuo was born in 1031 at Hangzhou in southern China. He became an impor-

 tant figure in both politics and science several decades later. His work in the field
 of astronomy was especially remarkable. In 1073, the second year he was appointed
 as the supervisor of the Astronomy Bureau, Shen Kuo presented three treatises to
 the emperor: Hun Yi Yi M§0E, Fu Lou Yi MMM, and Ying Biao Yi JISH. These
 three treatises, together called Shen Kuo San Yi žfcféHA (literally "Three arguments
 from Shen Kuo") are recorded in the Song shi #&. In them, Shen Kuo suggested

 to the emperor that he could better the work of the Astronomy Bureau by improv-
 ing astronomical instruments for, remarked Shen Kuo, "the people who work in
 the Astronomy Bureau are no better than those mediocre people at the market-
 place; they are basically ignorant of celestial configurations, astronomical charts
 and instruments" (BtW?fr#J*SR , £&PI$ , *«»*»). Shen Kuo believed that care-
 ful observation was one of the key ways to improve the Astronomy Bureau's work,
 for which better astronomical instruments were critically important. The emperor

 approved his suggestions, which did lead to improved instrumentation (Chen 2003, pp.
 472-474).

 The three articles of the Shen Kuo San Yi discussed the deficiency of the armil-

 lary sphere, clepsydra, and gnomon and suggested significant ways to improve them.
 Previous research, e.g., by Chen (2003, pp. 472-474) has established that Shen
 Kuo made great improvements to the armillary sphere in his Hun Yi Yi and to the
 clepsydra in the Fu Lou Yi. However, research on the Ying Biao Yi, which deals
 with the gnomon, has focused only upon the steps of the method used in mea-
 suring the length of its shadow (Chen 2003, pp. 472^74), paying less attention
 to the concepts that underpin Shen Kuo's method. Agreement has not even been
 reached on the specific steps to be followed in making observations with the gno-
 monas set out in the Ying Biao Yi. This article focuses on Shen Kuo's reason for
 criticizing the traditional orientation method and on his cosmological model. The
 effect of his method for measuring the length of the gnomon's shadow will also be
 discussed.

 The most difficult thing is to determine south-north direction in measuring the gno-

 mon shadow (at noon). The ancient method is to erect a pole at the center of a circle

 and mark the gnomon shadow (falling on the circle) at sunrise and sunset. The result is

 verified by the gnomon shadow at noon in daytime, and checked with the Pole Star at

 night. The Pole Star is not located right on the pole of the heaven. Whereas in another

 so-called shadow-measuring method, the longest shadows in the morning and evening

 are first marked on the circle, and then the middle way on the segment joining the two

 marks is to be found. When you get the shortest shadow (on this point) it is mid-day.

 However, (for) hundreds of Li surrounding the site of measurement, the elevation and
 east-west orientation could not be without unevenness. In between, there must also

 be towns, houses, hills, and woods blocking (the rays from the sun), which are not

 able to be known when they are located outside of the range of vision and mixed with

 the turbid fog. Still worse, the turbid fog depends on whether the day is clear, dull,

 windy, or rainy, while smoke and dust from the human world rise, fall, and change
 unpredictably. I, as your servant, have made the gnomon observation at the Bureau (of

 Astronomy) and found the time differs every day for the sun to rise from and set into
 the vagueness (on the horizon). This makes it impossible to find the true sunrise and

 sunset, and thus you cannot get the extremes of the shadow-lengths in the morning
 and evening.

 Referring to old information, I have invented a new method. Vertically set three

 copper gnomons of 8 Chi high, 3.3 Cun wide, and 2.2 Cun thick. Cut off the south part
 of the top of each gnomon to get a wedge-shaped tip. The base of each gnomon is a
 cube with each side of 2 Chi. Around the top surface of each base, a groove is chiseled
 to contain water for horizon keeping. Both gnomons and bases are made of copper.
 Mark the middle line with ink on each of the four vertical surfaces of the gnomons.

 Carve holes on the lines and hang from them four plumb lines with copper balls, each

 parallel to the ink lines on corresponding direction. Roughly determine the four direc-

 tions of the east, west, south, and north. Then put the three gnomons in a row along

 the south-north direction and let their bases touch each other, making a distance of 2

 Chi between two neighboring gnomon. Set every gnomon vertical and make the four
 plumb lines parallel to the corresponding ink lines. Measure the distances between

 every part of the three gnomons, making sure that they are strictly in a row. When the

 sun rises, measure the distances between the shadows of the three westward gnomons,

 as well as the length of the shadows. Record the results. When the sun sets, measure

 the shadows of the three eastward gnomons in the same way. When the shadows have

 the same lengths and are with equal intervals, join the ends of the western and eastern

 shadows of each gnomon, and find the mid- way point for the shortest shadow. When

 the five data conform to each other, the shortest shadow pointing to the mid- way is in

 the direction of north, while the ink lines on the south surface of the gnomons points

 down to south. The eastern and western ends of the shadows are pointing to east and

 west. Any one of the five data being inconsonant, all of them cannot be used for the
 determination of the cardinal directions.

 After knowing the four (cardinal) directions, one can set up a single gnomon (of 8

 Chi high), with a squared top. A flat stone bed is laid out at the foot of the gnomon

 and set horizontal with water, while the gnomon is erected at the south end of the bed.

 The bed is 3 Chi wide, as long as the length of the noon shadow on winter solstice of

 the place. Beginning from the foot of the gnomon, carve the scale division Fen (on the
 surface of the bed). Accumulating Fen makes up Cun and accumulating Cun makes

 up Chi. Build a closed chamber to house the gnomon, and open a slot on the roof

 right above the top of the gnomon to let the sun light in for noon shadows. The minor

 gnomon is 4 Cun high with the base. The base is 2 Cun wide and 5 Fen thick, with a

 squared top. Cut off the south part of the top to make it into a wedged-shaped tip. The

 minor gnomon is also made of copper. When the shadow of the major gnomon is too

 vague to be recognized, one can use the minor gnomon to make the shadow darker so

 as to measure it easily.

 3 Shen Kuo's criticism of the traditional orientation method

 One of the fundamental tools of observational astronomy in ancient China was the

 gnomon. Extensive discussions of the gnomon appear in early Chinese sources such
 as the Kao Gong Ji #xSB, written at the end of Chunqiu #$ period (770-40360, and
 the Zhou Bi Suan Jing J3WÎHS, written during the Han % dynasties (205 BC-AD 220)
 (Cullen 1996). Later, Chinese astronomers devoted significant efforts to improving
 methods of measuring the length of the shadow cast by a gnomon (Pan 2005).

 At the beginning of his Ying Biao K, Shen Kuo remarked that the most difficult step

 in setting up a gnomon is to determine the cardinal directions which the shadow cast by

 the gnomon will be measured against. Shen Kuo described the method of orientation
 used in ancient China as follows:

 A new interpretation of Shen Kuo's Ying Biao Yi 711

 The ancient method is to erect a pole at the center of a circle and mark the

 gnomon shadow (falling on the circle) at sunrise and sunset. The result is veri-

 fied by the gnomon shadow at noon in daytime, and checked with the Pole Star

 at night. The Pole Star is not located right on the pole of the heaven. Whereas in
 another so-called shadow-measuring method, the longest shadows in the morn-

 ing and evening are first marked on the circle, and then the middle way on the

 segment joining the two marks is to be found. When you get the shortest shadow

 (on this point) it is mid-day.

 Shen Kuo here refers to two traditional methods of measuring the length of the

 gnomon's shadow. The first method is recorded in the Kao Gong Ji:

 KAMM , ** , 5URI1M , ( £UK ) «&*o && , ^i 0 tti¿*« 0 A

 In order to know the direction when building a city, the constructor should do

 as follows: take advantage of water to make sure one small area is flat, and then

 set a stick vertical on the ground. After that, the observer should draw a circle

 on the ground. When the sun rises and sets, the two intersections of the shadow

 of the stick and the circle should be marked. The line joining the two intersec-

 tions points east and west. Orientation can be certain after referring to the stick's

 shadow at midday and the North Star at night.

 In this method the east-west line is determined by connecting the positions of a fixed

 length of the shadow cast by the gnomon at sunrise and sunset. The second method

 referred by Shen Kuo uses the length of the gnomon shadow to orientate through mea-

 suring the length of the gnomon shadow. This time the endpoints of the shadow cast

 by the gnomon at sunrise and sunset are measured. Joining the middle of the line that

 connects them to the tip of the mid-day shadow (when the shadow is shortest) provides

 a north-south line. This second method is also related to the procedure described in
 the Kao Gong Ji. Zheng Xuan JB£ (AD 127-200), an influential commentator and

 scholar at the end of Eastern Han, further explained the Kao Gong Ji method, noting
 that the semi-diameter of the circle should be equal to the length of the gnomon's
 shadow when the sun rises and sets. Many later astronomers uncritically followed
 Zheng Xuan's method in measuring the length of the gnomon shadow. Shen Kuo's

 criticism of the traditional method was aimed directly at Zheng Xuan's explanation.

 Continuing his discussion, Shen Kuo remarked:

 However, (for) hundreds of Li surrounding the site of measurement, the ele-
 vation and east-west orientation could not be without unevenness. In between,

 there must also be towns, houses, hills and woods blocking (the rays from the

 sun), which are not able to be known when they are located outside of the range

 of vision and mixed with the turbid fog. Still worse, the turbid fog depends on
 whether the day is clear, dull, windy or rainy, while smoke and dust from the

 human world rise, fall and change unpredictably.

 The difficulties Shen Kuo identified in the ancient measuring method can be divided

 into two categories: first, the effect of natural circumstance, e.g., hills, woods, or others

 things blocking the view of the horizon, and second, turbid air. When the sun is rising

 or setting, the sun's light is passing through the hazy air near to the ground. Shen Kuo

 gave an example from his own experience to illustrate the problem: as supervisor of the

 Astronomy Bureau, when he used the gnomon in making astronomical observations,
 he found that the extent of turbid air differs every day. As a result, his observations

 were notably affected since it was hard to determine the longest shadow of the gnomon

 in the morning or evening and as a consequence difficult to accurately establish the
 cardinal directions. Shen Kuo here repeatedly emphasized that the weak point of the

 existing method of using the gnomon is the effect of natural circumstance and turbid
 air, both of which are hard to control.

 Shen Kuo began his discussion with the statement that "(for) hundreds of Li sur-

 rounding the site of measurement, the elevation and east-west orientation could not
 be without unevenness." Due to the curvature of the earth, the shadow cast by a gno-

 mon will never reach the length of 100 Li (about 50km). Assuming that the earth is

 spherical all places on the its surface have their own north-south meridian, and there
 is no need to know the east-west direction when using the gnomon. So why did Shen

 Kuo stresses the importance of the east-west direction and give the figure of 100 Li? I

 suggest Shen Kuo was here working with a cosmological model in which the earth is
 flat. If the earth is flat, it is possible that the shadow cast by a gnomon can reach 100

 Li or even further. Furthermore, the earth will have a center point and a north-south

 direction that is unique to that point (Guan 2005). An observer cannot get the true
 south-north direction if the measuring site is not on the meridian line which passes

 through the center of the earth.

 In China, opinion on where the center of the earth is located changed during of the

 Tang 0 dynasty (seventh to tenth centuries AD) and the Song 5fc dynasty (10th to 13th

 centuries AD). Before the end of the Tang dynasty, it was generally held that the center

 of the earth was at Yangcheng RS$. However, in AD724 a nation-wide astronomical

 geodetic survey undertaken by the Buddhist monk Yi Xing - - ÍŤ showed that Yangch-

 eng was not at the center of the earth. The Xin Wu Dai Shi fcrEfti (New History of the

 Five Dynasties), compiled in the eleventh century, describes Yi Xing's work as follows:

 ±mmm , e»ť* , mrnrnns , m&ů*m , &ä*». «»¡e , soažm

 The ancient people believe the center of the earth is at Yangcheng, that is because

 it is near to Luoyang ftlt . In Kai Yuan Wťg, 12th year (AD 724), the emperor sent

 people to the whole country to make observations. According to the south place

 Liny i ttê, and the north place Hengye flW, the observers found that the center

 place which corresponds to the south and north direction should be Yuetai Sô(a

 place in Kaifeng HÖ). The great Zhou ffl established the country and placed the

 capital at Bian fr (another name of Kaifeng). The emperor set up the gnomon
 and clepsydra at Kaifeng. The result of measurement showed that it is according
 to the data in the center of the earth. This means Yuetai is the right place in cor-

 respondence with the sun and the Qi M (a day marking one of the 24 divisions

 of the solar year in the traditional Chinese calendar) which is the right place for
 the center of the earth.

 Subsequent authors therefore placed the center of the earth at Kaifeng H££ (Guan
 2000). The flat-earth cosmology was one of several competing cosmologies in China

 and was still widely accepted as late as the Song dynasty. I will return to the question

 of whether Shen accepted this cosmological model in the final part of this article.

 4 Shen Kuo's orientation method

 Following his criticism of the traditional method of setting up the gnomon, Shen
 Kuo presented his own method, known as the "three gnomon method." The steps of
 Shen Kuo's "three gnomon method" have been clearly explained by Chen Meidong
 as follows:

 The steps are listed as follows: First vertically set three copper gnomons on flat

 ground. The gnomons are all 8 Chi R high, 3.3 Cun Ý wide and 2.97 Cun Ý deep.
 Then, cut the south side of each gnomon wedge shaped and curve a sink on the

 base of the gnomon which is a 2 Chi cube to make the gnomon level by means

 of observing the water level. Mark the middle of each face of the base, and then

 hang a copper ball straight to each sign. Put the three gnomons in a row in the
 south-north direction and let their bases touch each other, with a distance of 2

 Chi between each gnomon. Measure the distance between each part of the three

 gnomons to make sure the three gnomons are strictly in a row. Finally, measure

 and record the length of the shadow of each gnomon and the angle between each

 two gnomons when the sun rises and sets, giving a total of five data. When all

 the five data coincide, we can then get to know the south-north direction using
 the second traditional measuring method. (Chen 2003, pp. 472^4-74)

 Shen Kuo's three gnomon method is shown in Fig. 1. Figure la-c represent three

 gnomons, d-f represent the gnomon shadow when the sun rises, and g-i represent the

 gnomon shadows when the sun sets. When the length of d-f equals the length of g-i,

 the angle between de and ef equals the angle between gh and hi, and we can then use

 the second traditional measuring method to get the south-north direction.

 Shen Kou claimed that his three gnomon method is a more effective method when

 compared to the traditional Kao Gong Ji method. As we have seen, Shen Kuo argued
 gnomon shadow observations are effected by the location of the gnomon and by
 turbid air obscuring the sun's rays when the sun is close to the horizon. As Shen Kuo
 remarked, the effects of turbid air cannot be reduced whatever method is used. Simi-

 larly, it is impossible to eliminate the presence of hills, cities, etc., blocking the sun's

 rays close to the horizon. Thus, it seems likely that Shen Kuo's "three gnomon method"

 can only have been formulated to resolve the problem of whether the observation site
 is at the center of the earth.

 Shen Kuo stated that once all the five data (the length of the gnomon shadows and
 the angles between them) coincide it is possible to use the second traditional method to

 obtain the north-south direction. Figure 2 illustrates Shen Kuo's argument. In Fig. 2,
 d represents the newly risen sun, e the setting sun, and a-c the three gnomons; the

 Fig. 2 The three gnomon method assuming the flat-earth cosmology. In the illustration the gnomons are

 not at the center of the earth and so the shadow lengths at sunrise and sunset differ

 lengths of gnomon shadows in the morning are ai, bj, and ck, and the lengths in the

 evening are af , bg, and ch. According to the flat-earth cosmology, the sun rises and sets

 at opposite points to the center of the earth (d and e in the diagram). This means that

 the distances between these two points and the center of the earth are equal. Therefore,
 when the observation site is not at the center of the earth, the distance between the

 sun and the observation site must be different at sunrise and sunset. Since the height

 of the gnomon does not change, the length of the gnomon shadow will therefore be
 different in at sunrise and sunset. Thus, in the figure, ai, bj, and ck are not equal to

 af, bg, and ch. Similarly, the angles between the tips of the shadows in the morning
 must be different to those in the evening. However, if the measurement is carried out

 at the center of the earth the distance between the sun and the gnomons is the same at

 sunrise and sunset, and so the lengths of the three gnomon shadows must be equal and

 A new interpretation of Shen Kuo's Ying Biao Yi 715

 similarly the distances between the tips of the gnomon shadows must also be equal.

 As a result, working in the flat-earth cosmology, whether the observation site is at the

 center of the earth or not is the key factor in whether the five data coincide.

 Shen Kuo's three gnomon method was a development of an earlier five gnomon

 method used to find the center of the earth proposed by Zu Geng fiBB during the South-

 ern Dynasties ÜS8 (420-589 AD). This method is also mathematically consistent with
 a flat-earth cosmology and was commented on with approval by later authors (Guan

 2000). Zu Geng's method is described in the Sui Shu W# dynastic history as follows:

 First check the time of sunrise and sunset, set up the water clock, define the time

 of Shi Chen b#Jr (a time period which equals to two hours). Set a gnomon in a

 flat area, call it the south gnomon. Then run the water clock, set another gnomon

 called the middle gnomon at the end of the shadow of the south gnomon at noon.

 Set up the north gnomon at midnight, make the top of it in a line with the top of

 the middle gnomon and the North Star. Then begin observation after knowing the

 three gnomons are all vertical. If the three gnomons are in a line, the place should

 be at the right south-north direction; if the gnomons are not in a line, the place

 is not right and the observer can know where the right place should be referring

 to the position of the middle gnomon. If it is in the west to the line, it means the

 measuring site is in the west to the center of earth, the observer should move to

 the east to find the center of earth, if it is in the east, it means the measuring site
 is in the east to the center of earth, the observer should move to the west to find

 it. When the three gnomons are straightly in a line, the measuring site should be

 at the middle of the earth on east-west direction. In the equinoxes, when half the

 sun has risen in the morning, set the east gnomon in the east of the middle gno-
 mon which is in a line with the sun and the middle gnomon. When half the sun

 has set in the evening of that day, set the west gnomon in the west of the middle

 gnomon which is in a line with the sun and the middle gnomon. The observer

 should refer to the position of the middle, the east and the west gnomons to know

 the position of the measuring site. If the middle gnomon is in the south, it means
 the measure site is in the south to the center of earth, the observer should move to

 the north to find the center of earth, if it is in the north, the observer should move

 to the south to find the center of earth. When the three gnomons are straightly

 in a line, the measuring site should be at the middle of the earth on south-north
 direction. When the east-west direction and the south-north direction are all

 right, the measuring site should be the center of earth.

 Rather than using the gnomon at sunrise and sunset, this method requires the use of a

 water clock to determine the moment of midnight, bringing a further possible source

 of error into the determination of the cardinal directions. This problem is eliminated

 in Shen Kuo's three gnomon method which uses the shadow cast by the gnomon at

 sunrise and sunset directly.

 5 Shen Kuo's shadow measurement method

 Once he has explained how to set up the gnomon, Shen Kuo presents a new technique

 for measuring the length of the shadow cast by the gnomon:

 After knowing the four (cardinal) directions, one can set up a single gnomon (of

 8 Chi high), with a squared top. A flat stone bed is laid out at the foot of the

 gnomon and set horizontal with water, while the gnomon is erected at the south
 end of the bed. The bed is 3 Chi wide, long as the length of the noon shadow

 on winter solstice of the place. Beginning from the foot of the gnomon, carve
 the scale division Fen (on the surface of the bed). Accumulating Fen makes up

 Cun and accumulating Cun makes up Chi. Build a closed chamber to house the

 gnomon, and open a slot on the roof right above the top of the gnomon to let
 the sun light in for noon shadows. The minor gnomon is 4 Cun high with the
 base. The base is 2 Cun wide and 5 Fen thick, with a squared top. Cut off the

 south part of the top to make it into a wedged-shaped tip. The minor gnomon is

 also made of copper. When the shadow of the major gnomon is too vague to be

 recognized, one can use the minor gnomon to make the shadow darker so as to
 measure it easily.

 Shen Kuo highlights two innovations in observational technique in this passage:
 first, the observation is to be conducted in a closed chamber with only a small slit to

 allow the sun's rays at noon into the room, and, secondly, a second gnomon is to be

 used together with the main gnomon in making the observation. Compared to the tra-
 ditional method of observing in an open area, observing in a closed chamber reduces

 the scattering of sunlight, thereby increasing the contrast between the shadow and the

 surrounding environment. Two suggestions have recently been put forward as to how

 the second gnomon was used together with the first gnomon to improve the observa-

 tions. Li (1983) has argued that "one can aim at the sun with the naked eye, making the

 head of the second gnomon, the head of the (first) gnomon and the center of the sun

 in a line." Li's explanation is problematical, however, as the second gnomon is only 4

 Cun high (about 13 cm and only one 20th the height of the first gnomon) and so it will

 be quite difficult to observe from the head of the second gnomon to the head of the first
 gnomon. A more likely explanation has been proposed by Chen (2003, pp. 472-474)

 Although the sun is quite weak, observers can still see a beam shoot in the closed

 room from the split on the roof. Then move the second gnomon to make the head

 of it just contact the beam to make the shadow clearer. The purpose of doing so is

 to diminish the phenomenon of penumbra on the accuracy of the measurement.

 We know that the sun is round, which leads to a penumbral zone at the end of the

 shadow and makes it hard to see the exact position of the shadow tips. The higher

 the gnomon is, the more seriously this phenomenon appears. Since the second
 table is only 4 Cun high which means the phenomenon of penumbra is much

 weaker, moving the second gnomon to make the head of it just contact the beam

 can greatly make the shadow clearer. I have done some imitation experiments
 which can also prove this.

 6 Conclusion

 In his History of Ancient Chinese Astronomical Instruments (2005, pp. 51-52), Pan
 Nai stated that there are six factors which can affect the accuracy of gnomon shadow

 measurement: the accuracy of the time of winter solstice and summer solstice; the

 accuracy of the north-south direction; whether the gnomon is vertical to the ground;

 whether the base of gnomon is level or not; the impact of penumbral zone on determin-

 ing the length of the shadow; and the traditional method of measurement (referring
 to the traditional measurement of the length of gnomon shadow on the solstice). In

 these six factors, the accuracy of determining the time of winter solstice and summer

 solstice and the measurement of the length of gnomon shadow at the solstice had been

 significantly improved by the Song Dynasty. The problem of whether the gnomon is

 vertical to the ground could be resolved by hanging a vertical string down the gnomon.

 Similarly, the problem of whether the base of gnomon is level or not could be resolved

 using a surface of water. Thus, by the Song dynasty, the major problems in making
 observations using a gnomon were determining an accurate north-south direction and

 the impact of the penumbra in reading the length of the shadow. Shen Kuo's sugges-

 tions for improvements in the method of using the gnomon attempted to solve these

 two problems. First, his three gnomon method aimed to allow the north-south direc-
 tion to be determined more accurately. Secondly, by placing the gnomon in a covered

 room and using a second subsidiary gnomon to help define the edge of the shadow,
 Shen Kuo made a significant improvement to the accuracy with which the length of
 the shadow could be measured.

 As I have argued, Shen Kuo's three gnomon method for determining the north-
 south direction was based upon a flat-earth cosmology. In his article on the armiliary

 sphere, the Hun Yi Yi, Shen Kuo stated that:

 When I examined the astronomical observation in ancient times, I found that

 although there is only 6000 thousand Li between Annan £Ü and Junyi /&Ä, the

 difference of degrees of the North Star is 15 degrees. Su Wen is good at talking

 about the sky. If we go straight to the north a little further, would not the North

 Star be straight over our head? In Huang Di's Jt^Sw Shu MM it stated, when you

 stand at the south pole you will face north, when you stand at the north pole you

 will face south, when you stand at the east to see the west or stand at west to see

 the east, you will still face north. When you stand at the east with your back to

 the west, when you stand at the west with your back to the east, when you stand

 at the south pole to see south, when you stand at the north pole to see north, you

 will all face south. I did not get a clear idea of this argument until recent times.
 This condition happens because we believe the center of sky is north, that is

 because the North Star is always at the center of sky. Su Wen is good at talking

 about the sky.

 Li (1995) has argued that here Shen Kuo expressed his belief in the cosmological

 theory of a canopy heaven with a round earth (but not the spherical heaven model that

 was used by several other astronomers of this time). However, on closer inspection

 of Shen Kuo's text, we can see that he is trying to interpret the words of Su Wen: "I

 did not get a clear idea of this argument until recent times" indicates that Shen Kuo

 himself had not thought this before. Rather than presenting his own view, Shen Kuo

 was trying to explain why Su Wen believed in a center of the sky, which is also the
 center of a circular earth in the theory of canopy heavens. We cannot use this para-

 graph as evidence that Shen Kuo himself believed that the earth is round. In his Ying

 Biao Yi, Shen Kuo clearly worked with a flat-earth cosmology. It is possible, however,
 that Shen Kuo at other times assumed other cosmological models, in particular the
 spherical heaven model that was adopted by several other Song dynasty astronomers.
