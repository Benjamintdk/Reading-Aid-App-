 Abstract Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) published two lunar theories in 1753 and
 1772. He also published lunar tables in 1745, 1746, and—anonymously—in 1750.
 There are notebook records, unpublished manuscripts, and manuscript fragments by

 Euler reflecting the development of his lunar theories between about 1725 until about
 1752. These documents might be used to reconstruct Euler's theory on which he based
 his calculations of those lunar tables and to analyze the development of his lunar
 theories within this time span. The results of this analysis will be published here in

 three parts representing three stages of Euler's research on this topic: First approaches

 (about 1725-1730), developing the methods (about 1730-1744), and the breakthrough
 (about 1744—1752). In this part, I analyze Euler's manuscripts and, predominantly,
 Euler's records of his first two notebooks written between 1725 and 1730.1 found that

 his early theoretical approach is coined by his development of analytical (rational)
 mechanics of punctiform bodies moved by central forces. He tried to describe the
 Moon's motion in terms of two simultaneously acting centripetal forces, Huygens'
 centrifugal theorem, and associated osculating radii.

 1 Introduction

 1.1 Overview

 The motions of Sun and Moon are by far the most influential astronomical phe
 nomena for cultural development. Their apparent daily, monthly, and yearly move
 ments on the celestial sphere are perceptible by everybody. The orbital motions of
 these celestial bodies are important for the daily life in various social and scientific

 respects. They dominate the calendars of and through all cultures, and they had a cru
 cial impact on the development of the exact sciences. The determination of time by
 measuring of lunar distances (defined as angular separations between the Moon and
 selected stars) or accurate predictions of (solar and lunar) eclipses represent the most
 prominent examples. Even today, the Earth's variable rotation may only be recon
 structed most accurately by using ancient solar eclipse observations (cf. Stephenson
 1997).

 The determination of the Moon's motion was one of the most difficult tasks in

 mathematical astronomy before the computer era. While the apparent motion of the

 Sun (reflecting the orbital motion of the barycenter of the Earth-Moon-System around

 the Sun) may be treated in good approximation as a so-called "two-body-problem" in
 terms of Keplerian orbital parameters, the determination of the motion of the Moon

 has to be regarded as a "three-body-problem" with the Earth and the Sun represent
 ing the central and the perturbating body, respectively. Isaac Newton (1643-1727),
 in his Principia, struggled with this problem, and his successors failed to solve the
 lunar problem exactly as it is derived from the principle of universal gravitation. The
 solution of the equations of motion for the Moon in an analytically closed form is
 impossible, as the mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) proved in his famous
 paper on the three-body-problem of 1889 (cf. Poincaré 1890; Barrow-Green 1997).
 With the establishment of the Leibnizian calculus, of the trigonometric functions, and
 of the equations of motion by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) it was possible to solve the
 coupled differential equation system of second order for the Moon's motion approx
 imately using series expansions by the early 1740s. In that time the first analytical
 lunar theories based on those mathematical methods and physical principles were
 developed simultaneously by Euler, Alexis-Claude Clairaut (1713-1765), and Jean le
 Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783).

 In the history of science, the development of lunar theories was addressed frequently

 during the last decades. The historical studies, however, were focussed mainly on
 the contributions by Newton (cf. Cohen 1975; Waff 1976b, 1977; Smith 1999a,b;

 Kollerstrom 2000). In particular, the problem of the apsidal motion of the Moon's

 orbit and its solution by Clairaut was analyzed with great emphasis (cf. Waff 1976a,

 1995). D'Alembert's unpublished manuscripts on lunar theory were published in the
 context of the edition of his collected works (cf. Chapront-Touzé et al. 2002). The
 appreciation of the significance and importance of Euler's lunar theories of 1753 and

 1772 is, however, still a missing part in the history of exact sciences. The analysis
 and edition of his unpublished manuscripts and notebooks related to lunar theory and

 of his anonymously published lunar tables are preparatory works for addressing and

 tackling this task. Euler's manuscripts will give us insight into his outstanding role in

 the development and history of the lunar theories as an essential part of the history of
 eighteenth century celestial mechanics.

 1.2 The scientific significance of lunar theories

 The description of the Moon's motion was one of the most important problems in the

 history of positional astronomy. From the antiquity, e.g. Ptolemy, until the middle of

 the seventeenth century geometric and kinematic theories were developed to predict

 solar and lunar eclipses and to construct calendars based on the observed motions of
 the Sun and the Moon (cf. Brack-Bernsen 1997; Toomer 1984). The determination of

 the Moon's position with an accuracy of less than one arc minute became an official

 challenge for eighteenth century scientists by the "Longitude Act" of 1714, initiating
 the search for a method to find the longitude at sea and, thus, to solve the most
 important problem of navigation (cf. Longitude Act 1714; Andrewes 1996). One of
 the most important astronomical solutions proposed was the method of lunar distances:

 from topocentric measurements of angular distances between the limb of the Moon's
 disk and nearby stars and its elevations at the local time of the observer one obtained

 geocentric angular distances, which then were compared with predicted and calculated
 values for the meridian of London (or Paris) tabulated in lunar tables (cf. Howse
 1996). The differences between observed and tabulated distances represent the time

 differences between these locations and thus yield the longitudes of the observer. The

 quality of this method depends crucially on the correctness and precision of the lunar
 tables involved in this procedure and consequently on the quality of the lunar theory
 used to construct them.

 Although Isaac Newton established the principle of universal gravitation in his
 Principia (cf. Newton 1687,1713,1726) and even published a "Theory of the Moon's
 Motion" in 1702 (cf. Newton 1702; Cohen 1975; Kollerstrom 2000), the first lunar the

 ories based on the law of gravitation and treated as a so-called "three-body-problem"

 including the application of equations of motion formulated in three dimensions were
 only developed in the 1740s by Leonhard Euler, Alexis-Claude Clairaut and Jean
 le Rond d'Alembert. The reason for this delay was the lack of adequate mathe
 matical methods and physical principles to cope with the analytical treatment of
 this three-body-problem (cf. Verdun 2010). It was Euler who first formulated gen
 eral equations of motion of the three-body-problem for the Earth-Sun-Moon system

 and introduced trigonometric series to integrate them using the method of undeter
 mined coefficients. Using his (unpublished) "embryonic" lunar theory of 1743/1744
 (cf. Verdun 2010), Euler constructed and published between 1744 and 1750 numer
 ous lunar tables incorporating perturbational effects of the Sun (cf. Verdun 2011).
 But only in 1753 his "first" lunar theory was published, one year after Clairaut's
 (cf. Euler 1753; Clairaut 1752). They solved the problem of the apsidal motion of
 the Moon's orbit, which was actually first noted already by Newton but which re

 appeared in 1747 when neither Euler nor Clairaut could derive this motion from
 the inverse square law of gravitation in accordance with observational data. Their
 lunar tables based on those theories (cf. Verdun 2011; Clairaut 1754), however, were
 not as accurate as the tables constructed by Tobias Mayer (1723-1762), which were

 Fig. 1 The construction and function of lunar tables and their relation to ephemerides and astronomical
 calendars. Lunar tables may also be incorporated in astronomical calendars

 published first in 1753 and 1754, then improved in 1770 (cf. Mayer 1753, 1754,
 1770), although his lunar theory is similar to that of Euler (cf. Mayer 1767). He
 developed and applied empirical methods to bring theory in close agreement with
 observations (cf. Wepster 2010). It was—among others—just such kind of processes,
 i.e., the determination of integration constants resulting from theory and the "correc

 tion" or improvement of the theoretically derived inequalities in the Moon's motion
 (represented by the coefficients of the integrated series expansions), with which Euler

 struggled when he tried to bring his "first" lunar theory of 1753 into closer agreement
 with observation.

 This process is displayed graphically in Fig. 1, illustrating the construction and
 function of lunar tables in general and their relation to ephemerides and astronom
 ical calendars, which are calculated from them. The perturbational terms resulting
 from theory were not directly tabulated in the lunar tables, because the equations of
 motion could be integrated only approximately. Therefore, the theoretically deter
 mined inequalities had to be corrected using observations, e.g. from solar and lunar
 eclipses or occultations of stars by the Moon. Such phenomena allowed the obser

 vation of the Moon's position with high accuracy, which was used to improve the
 inequalities in a parameter estimation process. These inequalities were then tabu
 lated as a function of the various linear combinations, e.g., of the relevant geocentric
 angular distances between Sun and Moon (so-called "elongations") and their (geo
 centric or heliocentric) ecliptic arc lengths. The precision of such tables, constructed
 for the meridian of London or Paris, became fundamental for solving the longitude

 problem. This is why the development of lunar theories and the construction of lunar

 tables play an important and significant role in the history of science. Numerous prize
 questions of the Academies of sciences of Paris and St. Petersburg addressed this
 problem, including the development and improvement of lunar theories. Lunar tables

 were used for navigational purposes even in the nineteenth century. The mathemat
 ical methods and physical principles emerging from the development of lunar theo
 ries had an immense impact on the exact sciences of the eighteenth and nineteenth
 centuries: Trigonometric series and Fourier analysis, physical and variational prin
 ciples, methods of analytical and numerical integration, parameter estimation meth
 ods, to mention but a few methods resulted from these theoretical works (cf. Verdun
 2010).

 The relevance of lunar theory and its history within the field of celestial mechan

 ics was best expressed, with an emphasis on the methods invented, by two authori
 ties in positional astronomy, the Swiss astronomer Alfred Gautier (1793-1881) and
 the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb (1835-1909). In 1817, Gautier

 wrote in the preface to his Essai historique (cf. Gautier 1817, pp. v-vij):

 On a dit déjà que l'histoire de l'Astronomie donne, plus qu'aucune autre, une
 juste idée des progrès de l'esprit humain. Si cela est vrai en général, cela
 s'applique spécialement, ce me semble, à l'histoire des travaux que la découverte
 de l'attraction a fait naître. [...] l'examen de la théorie de la Lune de Newton,

 fait par Clairaut et d'Alembert, peut servir à l'apprécier jusqu'à un certain point;
 la discussion entre ces deux derniers Géomètres nous éclaire sur les avantages
 et les inconvéniens de leurs méthodes; la franchise d'Euler nous découvre les

 imperfections des siennes [...].

 (It was already said that the history of astronomy gives, more than any other
 science, an exact idea of the progress of human esprit. If this is true in general,

 this applies in particular - as it seems to me - to the history of works made for the

 discovery of the attraction. The examination of Newton's lunar theory by Clairaut
 and d'Alembert can be used to appreciate it up to a certain point; the discussion
 between these two Geometers clarify the advantages and disadvantages of their

 methods; the ingenuity of Euler's let us discover the imperfections of his theory
 [·.·])

 Introducing his article of 1908, Newcomb wrote (cf. Newcomb 1908, p. 1):

 Parmi les problèmes de la mécanique céleste, celui du mouvement de la lune
 occupe un haut rang, à cause de sa difficulté, et du nombre des questions intéres
 santes auxquelles il a donné naissance. Il nous offre un bon exemple des méth
 odes générales de la science par lesquelles nous prédisons les phénomènes de la
 nature. [...] C'est dans la mécanique céleste que ces méthodes de recherche ont

 leur plus complète manifestation. La loi fondamentale est celle de la gravitation
 universelle suivant la formule de Newton [...] Depuis l'énoncé de la loi de New

 ton une succession de grands geomètres, tels que d'Alembert, Clairaut, Laplace,
 Lagrange, Euler, Plana, Damoiseau, Hansen, - je ne nomme pas les vivants -
 ont développé et perfectionné les méthodes de déduction, tandis que les maîtres

 de l'astronomie théorique ont corrigé sans cesse les éléments astronomiques au

 moyen des observations.

 (Among the problems of celestial mechanics the one on the motion of the Moon
 occupies a high rank due to its difficulty and the number of interesting questions
 which have emerged from it. It offers us a good example of general methods
 of science with which we predict the phenomena in nature. [...] It is in celes
 tial mechanics where these research methods are manifested most completely.

 The fundamental law is the one of universal gravitation according to Newton's
 formula. [...] Since the announcement of Newton's law a series of great Geome
 ters such as d'Alembert, Clairaut, Laplace, Lagrange, Euler, Plana, Damoiseau,
 Hansen,—I do not mention those alive—one has developed and perfected the
 methods of deduction, whereas the masters of theoretical astronomy improve

 permanently the astronomical elements using observations.)

 These statements underline the importance of the methods developed during the

 history of lunar theory not only for celestial mechanics but for the exact sciences in

 general. This is confirmed by the number of recent published monographs and papers
 on this topic (cf., e.g., Wilson 2008, 2010; Wepster 2010; Steele 2012).

 1.3 The structure of this article

 In Sect. 2, I will first describe the main body of Euler's published (Sect. 2.1) and
 unpublished (Sect. 2.2) writings related to lunar theory. I will refer to this section in
 the follow-up parts 2 and 3 of this series of papers. In Sect. 2.3,1 will describe in more
 detail the unpublished documents which may regarded as the beginnings of Euler's
 studies on lunar theory and which therefore are addressed in this part 1. The content

 of these documents is given almost in full length in the appendix of this article. In the
 main Sect. 3, I will focus on the reconstruction of Euler's first approaches to lunar
 theory using summaries of these documents. On one hand these summaries should

 give us insight in Euler's very first thoughts on the topic, on the other hand they will

 raise important questions, e.g., about the sources probably used by Euler to get into
 lunar theory, about the theoretical equipment available to him to tackle the problems,
 and about the mathematical and physical deficiencies which prevented him to solve

 the lunar problem successfully from the beginning. This will be the subject of the last
 Sect. 4, where I will venture a final assessment of Euler's first approaches to lunar

 theory.

 2 The corpus of Euler's documents on lunar theory

 2.1 Euler's published contributions to lunar theory

 Euler was concerned with lunar theory almost during his entire scientific career. His

 earliest manuscripts and notes on lunar theory were written between 1725 and 1727,

 his latest records are dated in the 1770s. He left us an extensive work on that topic
 which consists of published and unpublished treatises, notebook entries, and a huge
 correspondence related to some extent to the motion of the Moon. Nearly all of his
 original published works on lunar theory and lunar tables and a large part of that

 correspondence are included in the second and fourth series of his collected works,
 Leonhardi Euleri Opera Omnia, edited and published since 1910 by the Euler Com
 mission of the Swiss Academy of Sciences in four series: Series prima (mathematics),
 Series secunda (physics and astronomy), Series tertia (Miscellanea), Series quarta A
 (Correspondence), and (the planned and postponed) Series quarta Β (manuscripts and
 notebooks). Until now, 76 volumes in quarto have been published. The following list

 summarizes Euler's published works of the second Series sorted by their relation to his

 two lunar theories. In parentheses, I added to each item the years when its manuscript

 approximately (Estimation according to Verdun 2010) was finished and when it was
 published. They are numbered according to the bibliography of Euler's printed works

 by Gustaf Enestrom (cf. Enestrom 1910). The numbers are accompanied by the letters

 "E" and "A" referring to works by Leonhard Euler or by his son Johann Albrecht,

 respectively, which most probably were written under the supervision of his father.

 The chronological development (which is by far not identical with the corresponding

 dates of publication) and brief summaries of these treatises as well as all of Euler's

 treatises on celestial mechanics are discussed in Verdun (2010). It is worth noting that

 Euler's first lunar theory (E187) actually remained uncommented in the Opera omnia

 due to the death of the responsible editor. The editorial board used as a substitute for

 the editor's introduction to this work a text written by Félix Tisserand (1845-1896),

 which fails, however, to meet modern historiographical standards (cf. Tisserand 1894).

 Euler published lunar tables not only in 1746 and 1772. I was able to establish
 Euler's authorship of many anonymously published lunar tables (cf. Verdun 2011).
 These "unknown" Eulerian lunar tables appeared in different versions of the Astro
 nomical Calendars of the Berlin Academy of Science. These periodicals are nowadays

 extremely rare and thus hardly known to the scientific community. In addition, I showed

 that the lunar tables (E 87) incorporated in Euler's Opuscula varii argumenti (E 80, cf.

 Euler 1746) of 1746 are not identical with those (E76) published in 1745 (cf. Euler
 1745). Up to now, it had been assumed, that E76 is a preprint of E87, which is why
 Ε 76 was not included in the Opera omnia. Until now, I succeeded to establish Euler's
 authorship for the following tables (cf. Verdun 2011):

 - Tables de la Lune pour le Meridien de Paris
 - Tables pour corriger le lieu moyen de la Lune
 - Tables pour calculer la distance de la Lune à la Terre
 - Tables pour corriger le lieu moyen du Noeud & pour trouver l'Inclinaison de

 l'Orbite de la Lune à l'Ecliptique

 The tables published in 1750 in th& Almanac Astronomique are the most important

 ones of this list, because the Moon's position and motion can be determined for any

 epoch and any place on Earth from them. The other tables were calculated for special

 purposes using the former ones. It is remarkable to note that Euler constructed so many

 lunar tables until 1750 although his "first" lunar theory was published only in 1753. In
 a letter to Johann Caspar Wettstein (1695-1760) dated March 29, 1746, Euler wrote
 that he had no chance yet to print his lunar tables [of 1746] but he intends to publish

 them together with the theory (cf. original letter registered as R2749 in Juskevic et al.

 1975, to be published in Volume O.IVA 7 of the Opera omnia, as well as Juskevic et

 al. 1976, p. 258, where the citation differs somewhat from the original text):

 Je n'ai pas encore trouvé occasion de les [Ε87] faire imprimer mais je conte de
 les publier avec la theorie.

 This is why historians of Euler's work speculated time and again that there must have

 exist an "early" (i.e. pre-1753) lunar theory on which Euler based the calculations of his

 lunar tables published between 1745 and 1750. There is, in fact, strong evidence that

 Euler's alleged missing "embryonic" lunar theory is preserved, although fragmentarily,
 in his unpublished manuscript Ms 281 (cf. Sect. 2.2 and Table 1 below), which will
 be discussed in part 3 of this series of papers. Euler probably used this theory for the
 construction and calculation of his lunar tables published in 1745 (E76) and 1746
 (E87) as well as of his anonymously published lunar tables of 1749 and 1750 (cf.
 Verdun 2010, 2011). I intend to analyze this matter in a follow-up study, addressing
 in particular the reconstruction of Euler's "embryonic" lunar theory from Ms 281 and
 from his lunar tables.

 2.2 Euler's unpublished contributions to lunar theory

 Most of Euler's manuscripts are now preserved in the St. Petersburg Archive of the

 Russian Academy of Sciences. They were registered, tentatively dated, and numbered
 in 1962 by J. C. Kopelevic, M. V. Krutikova, G. K. Mikhailov, and Ν. M. Raskin

 (cf. Kopelevic et al. 1962). Table 1 lists the manuscripts and manuscript fragments
 related to lunar theory and gives the number of original manuscript pages. Some of
 them—indicated in this table by an Enestrôm number—were already published, but
 some remain unpublished until now. The published version must not necessarily be
 identical with the manuscript. The most prominent example, however, is Euler's draft
 version Ms 167 for his "Mechanica" (E15), which was published in 1736 (cf. Euler

 1736). This manuscript differs considerably from the printed version, which is why
 it was published in 1965 by Gleb K. Mikhailov (cf. Mikhailov 1965, pp. 93-224).

 There are further examples: Ms 282 contains two chapters (named "d" and "e" by
 Kopelevic et al. 1962 on p. 88) entitled "Constitutio elementorum motus Lunae" (The
 foundation of the elements of the Moon's motion, Sects. 1-6) and "Applicatio theoriae
 ad observationes eclipsum lunarium" (The application of the theory to lunar eclipse
 observations, Sects. 1-17), which were not included in the posthumously published
 version Ε 838, and also Ms 277 contains a chapter entitled "Alia methodus easdem

 inaequalitates eruendi" (A further method with which the inequalities may be found),
 which was not included in the printed "first" lunar theory Ε187. On the other hand,
 the Chapters XVI-XVIII as well as the "Additamentum" of Ε187 are missing in the
 original manuscript Ms 277. Consequently, all "published" manuscripts need to be
 checked for the purpose of an adequate reconstruction of Euler's lunar theories, as

 well. Some of the manuscripts mentioned in Table 1, for example Ms 281, turned out

 to be very important for this reconstruction, as we shall see in part 3 (cf. Verdun 2010).
 Of similar importance are Euler's notebooks. There are 12 of them, listed in

 Kopelevic et al. (1962) with No. 397-No. 408, which I will call Ms397-Ms408,
 respectively, and which comprise about 4,200 pages, whereof about 100 pages con

 cern lunar theory.

 All these documents—manuscripts and notebook records—have never been

 analyzed before in the context of the development of Euler's lunar theory. A first
 approximate analysis was done in Verdun (2010). That study showed the potential
 inherent in these documents. Although some of the manuscripts are unfinished or

 only fragmentarily preserved, and although the records contained in the notebooks

 often are extremely fragmentary, they may be used to put together the pieces for the
 development of Euler's early lunar theories. This is a difficult task solved to some
 extent in Verdun (2010). This reconstruction, although incomplete, will disclose the

 basic approach, the scientific context, and the principle methods available to Euler for

 dealing with the lunar problem.

 For this first of three essays on the subject, only two manuscripts and the first two

 notebooks are relevant. It is impossible to date them exactly to within, e.g., 1 or 2
 years. Consequently, the order I present them here is mainly for didactic reasons. Not

 every derivation of mathematical formulae and not every explanation and comment by

 Euler can be reproduced here. This will be the goal of a critical edition of these works,
 which is also being prepared. Figures (sketches) are reproduced as exact copies of
 Euler's original drawings, including all inconsistencies and inaccuracies (e.g., faultily
 drawn tangential or perpendicular lines). When reconstructing intermediate results
 and formulae which Euler did not derive explicitly, I often will refer to Volume I,
 Chapter V, of his "Mechanica" (cf. Euler 1736), which Euler finished in 1734 and
 which contains much of the results developed by him already several years earlier.

 2.3 Description and dating of the unpublished documents

 Four documents preserved in the Archives of the Russian Academy of Science in St.

 Petersburg may be considered as the earliest manuscripts by Euler that contain his first

 but still tentative approaches to lunar theory: two of Euler's unpublished manuscripts,
 here referred to as Ms 272 and Ms 180, as well as his first two notebooks, also called

 "Adversaria mathematica" I and II, or the "Basel notebook" and the "travel diary"
 respectively, but here referred to as Ms 397 and Ms 398. Ms 397 was written during
 the period when Euler lived in his hometown Basel until 1727, and Ms 398 contains
 records of a "Diarium" describing his journey from Basel to St. Petersburg in 1727
 (cf. Fellmann 2007). Due to the uncertainty in the exact dating of these documents,

 I will present them in a hypothetical, didactically motivated order thus underlining the

 evolutionary character of the development of Euler's early lunar theory.

 2.3.1 Euler's manuscript Ms272

 This document is listed as number 272 in the catalogue of Euler's unpublished manu
 scripts (see Kopelevic et al. 1962, p. 85). It consists of two folios written on both sides

 in a carefully executed clean copy style handwriting. Kopelevic et al. (1962) dates this

 manuscript to the years 1726-1728, perhaps because of its characteristic style (ductus
 litterarum) of Euler's early handwriting. It is entitled "Dissertatio de Motibus Luna;"

 (Treatise on the Moon's motion) and contains eight paragraphs consisting solely of

 text and no formulae. There are only very few corrections and emendations by Euler.

 One may conclude that Euler probably intended to use it as an introductory passage to

 a larger treatise on the Moon's motion stating its principle problems and observable

 inequalities. It may therefore be considered an unfinished work by Euler.

 2.3.2 Euler's manuscript Ms 180

 This document is registered as number 180 in the catalogue of Euler's unpublished
 manuscripts (see Kopelevic et al. 1962, p. 64). It consists of three folios written on both

 sides in a carefully executed clean copy style handwriting. Kopelevic et al. ( 1962) dates

 this manuscript to the years 1725-1726, perhaps for the same reason as for Ms 272. It is

 entitled "De Motu corporum a pluribus viribus centralibus sollicitatis" (On the motion

 of bodies driven by multiple central forces) and contains two "lemmata" and four

 "problemata", illustrated by four marginal figures. There are only very few corrections

 and emendations by Euler. He probably intended to use it as part (chapter) of a larger

 treatise on mechanics. Euler left this manuscript unfinished, ending abruptly while

 solving the forth problem.

 2.3.3 Euler's notebook Ms397 (Adversaria mathematica I)

 The composition of the "Basel notebook" Ms 397 was dated by Kopelevic et al. ( 1962),

 p. 114, to the years 1725-1727. It consists of 213 double-side written folio pages. The
 strongest evidence for this dating is the fact that it contains in the middle of the
 notebook (cf. Ms 397, fol. 82r-84v) a fragment of a draft letter by Euler to Daniel
 Bernoulli (1700-1782) written in November 1726 (Juskevic et al. 1975, No. 91,
 p. 17). In this letter, Euler mentions his dissertation ("Habilitationsschrift") on the

 theory of sound (E2), with which he competed in spring 1727 for the physics profes
 sorship in Basel, as well as the public prize competition announced in 1726 by the
 Paris Academy on the optimal way of setting up the masts on ships (cf. Fellmann
 2007). Euler wrote (cf. Ms 397, fol. 84r):

 Constat sine dubio de Problemate Nautico quod Academia Regia Scientiarum
 Gallica hoc anno proposuit, cujusque praemium pro[xi]mo paschate distri adju
 dicetur [sic!]. Illius quoque solutionum misi, ita autem illud sonat, Quelle est la
 Meilleure maniéré de master les Vaisseaux, tant par rapport à la situation qu'au
 nombre et hauteur des Masts.

 This statement may be translated as:

 You know without doubt about the nautical problem that the Royal French Acad

 emy of Sciences proposed this year, and for which the prize will be awarded next
 Easter. I have sent a solution of this, too; [the question is] as follows: "What is

 the best way of masting ships, both with regard to the position and to the number

 and height of the masts?"

 The notebook was almost in its entirely used by Euler as a clean copy of a textbook

 on mechanics, in which he transformed the relevant content of Newton's Principia

 into his own analytic language using the Leibnizian calculus as developed further by
 his teacher in Basel, Johann I Bernoulli (1667-1748). Evidence for this are numerous

 marginal references to the corresponding pages in the Principia. These references
 pertain to the second edition of the Principia (cf. Newton 1713; Mikhailov 1965,
 footnote on p. 42), which confirms the starting date of composition of this notebook

 before the third edition of the Principia which was published in 1726 and to became
 available to Euler in 1727 (cf. Newton 1726; Ms398, Sect. 2.3.4 below).

 2.3.4 Euler's notebook Ms398 (Adversaria mathematica II)

 The "travel diary" was dated by Euler himself on folio 2r with "A[nno] 1727". His
 "Diarium" of the journey from Basel to St. Petersburg started on April 1, 1727. It was
 published by Mikhailov (1959), pp. 275-278. This notebook consist of 85 double
 side written folio pages. It shows the characteristics of a waste book and contains not

 only scientific but practical notes concerning, e.g., Russian words listed in dictionary

 manner, names of persons Euler met during his journey, etc. Further details about this

 notebook are given in Mikhailov (1959). The notebook contains values of parameters

 and orbital elements which Euler copied from the third edition of Newton's Principia

 (cf. Ms 398, fol. 50v-5 lr), a fact that confirms Euler's own dating of this notebook. A

 peculiarity of the travel diary concerns the curiosity that Euler wrote into this notebook

 starting first from the front side until folio 40r, then turned it around by 180°, and then

 continued to use it from the back side. Another "anomaly" concerns the interim use
 of a pencil instead of an ink feather. This is the more pitiable because the constant

 rubbing-off of the lead particles from the paper (caused by the mutual friction between
 the folio pages over the centuries) resulted in the loss of legibility of most of the
 folios of Ms 398. Nowadays, modern technology (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared, or X-ray
 spectroscopy or photometry) might allow us to uncover and analyze the information
 hidden in these folios. Unfortunately, there are—as far as I know—no plans for such

 a project in this direction, which would help to reconstruct an essential part of Euler's
 intellectual biography.

 3 Reconstruction of the development of Euler's first approaches to lunar theory

 I analyzed these unpublished manuscripts and notebooks written by Euler between
 1725 and 1730 containing his earliest tentative approaches to lunar theory. There is
 evidence that Euler learned the basic empirical facts on the Moon's motion from Ismael

 Boulliau's Astronomia philolaica of 1645 and from the books by David Gregory and
 Charles Leadbetter. He was most probably motivated to engage with lunar theory
 by Newton's statements on the motion of the lunar apsides in the Principia. Euler
 formulated his very first thoughts on the motion of the Moon in terms of central

 forces, osculating or curvature radius, Huygens' centrifugal theorem, and multiple
 force centers (represented by the Earth and the Sun) acting simultaneously on the
 Moon. His first approaches were dominated by the problem of central force motion,

 which at that time (about 1710) took an important role in the proof of the inverse

 problem of central forces by Johann I Bernoulli and Jacob Hermann. Pierre Varignon
 published a series of papers on that topic using the Leibnizian calculus between 1703

 and 1712. When Euler was transforming Newton's Principia into analytical language
 resulting in what we now call rational mechanics, he was following a tradition of

 mechanical and mathematical methods prepared by Bernoulli, Hermann, and Varignon

 (cf. Guicciardini 1999, Chap. 8). We may conclude that Euler's first steps emerged from

 this context and thus may be judged as quite unspectacular with respect to innovative

 ideas. Euler's grappling with multiple force centers and associated osculating radii
 led him to the concept of the osculating ellipse. This conflict actually concealed a
 fundamental problem, namely the choice of an appropriate (origin of) reference frame,
 that Euler disentangled some time later in his "Mechanica" by the discovery of what

 he called "genuina methodus" (genuine method), but what I call the principle of the

 transference of forces. This principle turned out to be the most important step towards

 a powerful lunar theory which Euler took between 1730 and 1744.1 will explain these
 statements now in more detail using summaries of the relevant documents.

 The content of each document addressed in this part is presented and analyzed in

 detail in the Appendix. Disregarding the mathematical aspects, here I will summarize

 and discuss the document's contents according to their main topics, stressing their
 outlines, the principal goals and ideas focussed by Euler as well as the strategies,
 methods, and arguments used by him. In addition, I will explain the astronomical and

 physical concepts and principles that play a role in these documents.

 3.1 Summary of Ms 272

 In Ms 272 (cf. Appendix A) Euler tried to get an overview of the principal inequalities

 which are observed in the Moon's motion. In celestial mechanics the term "inequality"
 means something which has to be added to (or subtracted from) the mathematical or

 geometrical representation describing the circular motion of a celestial body under
 consideration in order to make it accord with the observation of this motion. Thus, the

 concept "equality" refers to a uniform circular motion, so that everything that disturbs
 it (which is called a perturbation) transforms this "equality" (in the mathematical
 sense) into an "inequality". In general, the inequalities or deviations of the real motion

 from the simple circular model occur "along track" (i.e., along the body's trajectory)
 or "across track" (i.e., out of the body's orbital plane). The former inequalities are
 called longitudinal, the latter latitudinal with respect to a reference frame defined
 by the body's mean orbit. Due to this definition, longitudinal inequalities may even
 be caused by non-uniform circular motion or by non-circular (e.g., elliptical) orbits

 varying distance (or "altitude" as Euler calls it) continually from the central body and
 thus changing the velocity in the orbit due to Kepler's laws. This is why elliptic (or
 Keplerian) orbits cause the largest longitudinal inequalities and are therefore called
 first inequalities. Euler discusses other such inequalities in longitude, which today are

 called evection and variation. He describes also the inequalities in latitude defined
 as (periodic) deviations of the body's trajectory from a great circle defined by the
 mean orbit considered as reference plane. The excentricity of the body's orbit caused

 by its ellipticity or by any other non-circular form of the orbit induces a variation
 of the body's distance or altitude from the central body and thus (due to the law of

 gravitation) a variation of the orbital velocity. Euler describes the effect of this kind

 of inequality as well. He then turns to the contributions by Newton who solved the
 direct and inverse problem thus connecting Kepler's laws with the inverse square

 law of gravitation. Euler points out that there remained, however, a serious problem

 unsolved by Newton. It concerns the fact that, in general, orbits are not fixed in space

 250 A. Verdun

 but rotate around the central body situated in one focus, which Euler—following
 Newton—called "mobile" orbits. In the case of the Moon's elliptic orbit this kind

 of mobility results in a continuous motion of its apsidal line as well as of its nodes
 (defined by the intersection between the Moon's and the Earth's orbital planes) with
 respect to inertial space or (in Euler's words) with respect to the zodiac defined by
 the sequence of its signs. There was a considerable discrepancy (up to a factor 2)
 in the lunar apsidal motion between theory and observation, which had already been

 recognized by Newton, who left this problem unsolved. On one hand, this fact was

 probably Euler's motive to get into lunar theory in the first place, on the other hand he

 ascribed this difficulty to the unsolved problem of treating mathematically multiple

 force centers (e.g., Sun and Earth) acting simultaneously on another body (e.g., the
 Moon), one of these centers being in motion as well. To solve this problem by using

 the differential calculus was Euler's motive and starting point for his early approaches.

 3.2 Summary of Ms 180

 The manuscript Ms 180 (cf. Appendix B) may be considered a first trial to cope with

 the problem of multiple central forces. The most important parameter which Euler tries

 to determine is the velocity (or speed) of the body at any place of its orbit around the

 central body (or bodies). In the eighteenth century, it was not possible to measure the

 velocity of, e.g., a body falling onto the Earth. This is why the final speed of a freely

 falling body on the Earth's surface was substituted by its height of fall. Therefore,
 the speed or absolute value of velocity of any body on Earth or even of a celestial
 object was expressed by its corresponding altitude of free fall on Earth (neglecting
 air resistance and fictitious or pseudo forces). Thus, the concepts "speed" and its
 corresponding "altitude" were used synonymously by Euler. The general approach
 to determine this speed is—at first glance—quite simple. Equating the gravitational
 (or centripetal) force acting on the body at any point of its orbit by the central body

 with the centrifugal force defined by the osculating radius and the velocity at this
 point as given by Huygens' centrifugal theorem. This equation may easily be solved
 for the body's velocity, which may be used to determine the tangential and normal

 force components acting on the body at the given point. The centrifugal force is then
 defined by the normal component, which depends on the osculating radius at this
 given point. Given these parameters, Euler is able to derive de Moivre's theorem in a

 straightforward manner. This theorem is a generalization of Huygens' theorem (which

 is applicable only for circular motions) and allows the determination of the centripetal

 force for non-circular motions in terms of the body's velocity at a given point of its

 trajectory, of the osculating radius at that point, of the distance between that point

 and the force center, and of the perpendicular from the force center to the tangent

 passing through that given point (i.e., the straight line SA in Fig. 2). However, there

 remains the painful difficulty that the osculating radius has to be determined for every

 point of the trajectory. If the orbit is defined by a closed curve, e.g. by an ellipsis, this

 problem might be solvable. In the central force problem, where just one force center

 is acting on the body, there is no problem. But what happens if there are two force

 centers acting simultaneously on the body, one of them even moving with respect to

 the other, and therefore the resulting orbit of the body will not be a closed curve?
 Euler postponed this problem for further investigation (see Ms 397 and Ms 398) and
 simplified the static problem by considering both force centers as fixed in inertial
 space. In this case, the tangential and normal force components produced by each
 of the force centers can be superimposed, i.e., added together, to one resulting force

 (consisting of two terms) of each kind. The resulting velocity at a given point of the

 body's curve due to the double component normal force is then also composed of two

 terms. The integration of the corresponding first order integro-differential equation is

 beyond Euler's capabilities at that time. This is probably why he did not continue his

 manuscript and left it unfinished.

 3.3 Summary of the records in Ms 397 and Ms 398

 The analysis of Euler's notebooks Ms 397 and Ms 398 is quite more difficult than
 of his manuscripts, because (1) the individual entries are distributed over almost the
 whole books and therefore, in a first step, have to be recognized and identified as

 relevant for lunar theory, (2) they often are only sparsely commented by Euler, and the
 meaning of the mathematical symbols used by him is not always explained, (3) the
 entries have to be related to a special topic of lunar theory and put together according

 to some common relevant topics. The last task is not manageable without an a priori

 hypothesis about the contents of each entry. The result is thus inevitably affected by a

 certain degree of subjectivity.

 There are four topics transpiring through the tangle of entries in Ms 397 (cf. Appen

 dix C), which are related to lunar theory. In a first one (cf. Appendix CI), Euler deter

 mines the Moon's motion in a spatially fixed orbit which he assumes to be coplanar

 with the ecliptic, i.e. the Earth's orbital plane. "Motion" of the Moon means for Euler

 its velocity defined at any given point in its orbit. Therefore, the main goal is the deter
 mination of this velocity in a most general way. For this purpose, he derives equations

 for the resulting normal and tangential forces acting on the Moon by the Earth and
 the Sun. In this sense he actually treats what is called today a restricted three-body
 problem. The overall strategy is nevertheless the same as already described above:
 having found the resulting normal component acting on the Moon, the centrifugal
 force is determined using Huygens' theorem, which then is equated to the resulting

 centripetal force defined by the gravitational action of Sun and Earth. Most striking is
 the fact that Euler did not apply any form of what we now call equations of motion.
 Instead, Euler's derivations are dominated by his attempt to find useful geometric

 relations to express in a simple way the different distance and force ratios which occur

 in his calculations. Even more striking is the fact that he did not introduce time as an

 independent parameter. The final differential equations for the resulting normal and

 tangential force components become functions of the masses of Earth and Sun, the
 distances between them and the Moon, and its first and second derivatives, i.e. the line

 elements. Euler is able to solve them only for the special case when the lunar apogee

 coincides with its opposition to the Sun. This solution is still far from what we would
 call a successful description of the Moon's motion. As we will see in the third part
 of this series of papers, dealing with the epoch from 1744 to 1752, the use of general

 252 A. Verdun

 equations of motion and its parametrization for the time argument, which would led
 to such success, will be Euler's fundamental breakthrough in that period.

 Some other entries may be identified as related to a second topic (cf. Appendix

 C2), where Euler tries to find differential equations to describe the motion of the lunar

 apsides. Here, we find him dealing with mobile orbits, i.e. elliptic orbits rotating around

 one of their foci, and thus taking up the famous problem Newton left unresolved. He is

 searching for relations between two forces, one of them acting in the immobile orbit,

 causing the Moon to move in its orbit, and the other acting in the mobile orbit, causing

 the Moon's elliptic orbit to move around the center of force being in one focus. Having

 found this ratio, he supposes these forces as being given and the motion of the orbit as

 to be determined in terms of the body's velocity in its orbit and the angular velocity of

 the rotating orbit. Using this result he derives a second order differential equation for
 the line element of the body's trajectory and its components, but leaves this equation
 unsolved.

 Quite a lot of Euler's notebook entries concern the problem of general central force

 motion, which may be applied not only to the Moon's motion but to the motions of the

 planets as well. This third topic (cf. Appendix C3) is related to some chapters of his

 draft version of the treatise on mechanics, which he began to compose in this notebook
 and which were published in 1965 (cf. Mikhailov 1965, Chap. I, pp. 38-41, Chap. II,
 pp. 41-47, Chap. XII, pp. 61-62). While these chapters do not specifically concern
 the central force motion of celestial bodies, the records contained in the remaining

 folios do so. There Euler derives the velocity of the Keplerian motion, i.e., of the two

 body-problem, together with the central force causing this motion. Using an equation

 defining the perpendicular distance between the force center and the tangent passing

 through the body's current place in its orbit (i.e., the straight line SA in Fig. 2), he
 determines the "orbital parameters" algebraically and provides formulae for them
 which are adapted for applying them to the special case of the Moon's motion around

 the Earth and which are simplified by the insertion of numerical values thus making
 them usable for the easy computation of, e.g., lunar tables. The theorems that Euler
 derives in connection with this result depend on algebraic relations which follow from
 the geometry of the ellipsis, which he found "earlier" in this notebook. In one of
 these theorems he claims that if the centripetal force is increasing, then the orbit's
 major axis is decreasing, and vice versa. The proof is based both on the equation
 for the above-mentioned perpendicular distance (SA) and on the equation defining
 the "latus rectum", i.e. the parameter of the conic section. In Ms 398 (cf. Appendix
 D), Euler develops his considerations on the general central force motion further and

 amends his notes in Ms 397 on that topic. Again (cf. Appendix Dl), he focuses on the

 determination of the "orbital parameters" and on the derivation of differential equations

 which relate them to each other. As fundamental orbital parameters Euler considers the

 distance between the force center and the body, whose motion has to be determined, the

 instantaneous radius osculating the curve at a given point where this body is located,

 the body's velocity at that point, and the perpendicular line SA as defined in Fig. 2,
 disregarding any inclination of the body's orbit thus using it as a reference plane.
 He first derived Keill's theorem, which actually represents de Moivre's theorem in

 differential form. He substitutes (at this point for the first time) the line element of the

 body's orbit by the time element and obtains, using de Moivre's theorem, a differential

 equation for this time element, which depends on the above-defined orbital parameters

 and on the arc length covered by the body in its orbit during this time element. Euler

 immediately re-substitutes it by the corresponding line element of the curve to obtain

 equations for the parameters SA and the osculating radius as a function only of given
 distances and their first and second derivatives. At that point we catch Euler keeping
 the time parameter out of his equations, not yet recognizing that this would be an
 important step forward (as we will see in part 3). At that time, he seemed still be

 biased by the idea that the body's trajectory must also be determined only by distance
 elements, i.e., by the central force induced geometry of the orbit. Finally, he derives

 this result again with a slightly different kinematic approach.

 There are also "standing alone" entries in both of Euler's notebooks dealing with
 the relative motion of two bodies, with observational data of the Moon's motion, and

 with the general three-body problem. The first of these topics (cf. Appendix D2) is
 very interesting with respect to its innovative momentum. It pertains to one of the
 crucial ideas—I speculate—that will lead Euler to the principle of the transference
 of forces (see part 2). This is suggested by the question Euler formulated to describe
 the relative motion of two bodies as seen from one of them considered to be at rest.

 Some time later, Euler will transform this idea into a rule which defines how to apply

 the forces acting mutually between three bodies in such a way that the motion of one

 of them can be described as seen from another of them considered to be at rest. The

 records specifying orbital data of the Moon's motion (cf. Appendix D3) turned out to

 be important for the identification of one of Euler's sources from where he learned the

 basics of lunar theory.

 Another miscellaneous topic in Ms 397 is Euler's very first approach to the general

 three-body-problem representing the theoretical background and basis of the lunar

 problem (cf. Appendix C4). The result is sobering or even disappointing. His "success"

 does not go beyond some geometric relations between the positions of the three bodies.

 The way of solving this problem reflects Euler's misinterpretation of its complexity and
 difficulty, of which he will become fully aware only in the 1740s. Euler's unpublished
 manuscript Ms 251, which was published only in 1992 (cf. Knobloch 1992), gives
 evidence that Euler completely undervalued this problem at that time (around 1730).

 The last one of the topics treated by him in his notebooks brings the corresponding
 entries of both notebooks together. These entries may be interpreted as Euler's first

 approach to cope with the problem of two force centers, one of them is moving around

 the other one, and the resulting trajectory of a third body being subject of the central

 forces acted by the others has to be determined (cf. Appendix E). His approach was

 a failure. Nevertheless, it led him probably to the concept of the so-called osculating

 ellipse. This is an ellipse which instantaneously fits best the body's trajectory at a
 given point. So the ellipse is changing its parameters, which characterize its form and

 position, continuously with time. Unfortunately, Euler left us only fragmentary notes

 on his ideas to solve that problem. From the four sketches he drew to illustrate what is

 going on we may, however, assess the difficulty with which Euler was confronted. Two

 of these figures, representing the Sun-Earth-Moon system, are closely related to each

 other. One figure shows the situation where the centers of the osculating radii coincide
 with the two force centers of the Sun (5) and Earth (Τ), implying that Euler assumes

 here the Moon (L) describing a circular orbit around the Earth. In the other figure he

 drew the situation where the osculating radius associated with the centripetal force

 acting on the Moon by the Earth is larger than the instantaneous distance between these

 two bodies, implying that Euler assumes here the Moon moving in a non-circular orbit.

 The difficulty arising from this latter situation concerns the problem that it seems that

 it was not clear for Euler how to determine the resulting osculating radius assumed as

 a superposition of the two radii associated with each force centers. Euler tries to find

 a relation between these two osculating radii resulting in an equation that defines the

 position and orientation of the osculation center associated with the Earth with respect

 to the Sun being considered as fixed in inertial space. The result is quite complicated
 and did not allow Euler to deduce any conclusions, which could have been useful for

 further investigations in that direction.

 4 Final assessment of Euler's first approaches to lunar theory

 Let me infer from the manuscripts and notebook records discussed here for the period
 from about 1725 until about 1730 the crucial points which were important in the
 development of Euler's first approaches to lunar theory during this period of time.
 These documents reveal three issues which have to be addressed: 1. The sources,

 from which Euler learned about lunar theory, 2. the theoretical framework which was

 available to Euler at that time, and 3. the main deficiencies in Euler's first approaches
 to tackle the lunar problem successfully.

 4.1 Euler's sources to get into lunar theory

 From Euler's studies of Newton's Principia Newton (1687, 1726) as reflected in his
 entries on mechanics written in his first "Basel notebook" (Ms 397) and his "travel
 diary" (Ms 398) respectively, we may assume that he was acquainted with Newton's
 lunar theory. In addition, from Euler's "Catalogue Librorum meorum" (Euler's own
 catalogue of his library, written between 1747 and 1749) of his sixth notebook (cf.

 Ms 402, fol. 192r-201 v) we know that he possessed Gregory's Astronomies (cf. Ms 402,
 entry No. 453, fol. 200v; Gregory 1702,1726, which contains Newton's lunar theory),

 from which he adopted at least numerical values of orbital parameters and from which

 he most probably learned the state-of-the-art on lunar theory, as well as Leadbetter's
 Astronomy and Astronomy of the Satellites (cf. Ms 402, entries no. 95-97, fol. 194r;
 Leadbetter 1728, 1729). But there is strong evidence, that Euler studied the basic

 phenomena related to lunar theory from a treatise of the seventeenth century which
 became a standard textbook at the time, namely Book III (De lunae motibus) of Boul

 liau's Astronomia philolaica (cf. Boulliau 1645). I compared astronomical concepts,
 statements, and numerical values from Ms 272 and fol. 38v of Ms 398 with Boulliau

 (1645), Lib. Ill, and found them in very good coincidence with each other, as the
 following examples illustrate. In Ms272, fol. lr (Sect. 2), Euler wrote:

 Dum linea synodi a 270 g. anomaliae in 90. properat, tantisper secundae inasqual
 itates, a conjunctione ad oppositionem, ablativae sunt, ab oppositione ad con
 junctionem adjectivae.

 Leonhard Euler's early lunar theories 1725-1752 255

 On page 102 of Boulliau (1645), Lib. Ill, Boulliau wrote:

 Dum autem percurrit linea Synodi à 170.g. anomaliae in 90. tantisper secundaa
 inaequalitates in primo semicirculo Synodicae revolutionis, hoc est à coniunctione
 ad oppositionem, ablativse sunt; in secundo adiectivas.

 The digit "1" of the number "170" is a misprint and should be "2". Euler's statement

 is distinctively an abbreviated version of Boulliau's. The concept "linea synodi" means

 the line conjoining the syzygies. Newton or Gregory only used the term "syzygia". In
 Ms 272, fol. lr (Sect. 2), Euler wrote:

 Cum enim linea synodi cum linea absidum congruit, maxima turn observatur haec

 secunda inaequalitas per totam Lunationem. Si autem cadit in lineam mediarum

 longitudinum, nulla fere est inaequalitas secunda.

 On page 101 of Boulliau (1645), Lib. Ill, Boulliau wrote:

 Cum etenim linea Synodi Luminarium convenit cum linea absidum, maxima
 tunc contingit inaequalitas synodica per totam lunationem. Si verô ista Synodi
 linea cadat in médias longitudines, nulla fere tunc est per totam Lunationem
 imequalitas secunda.

 Aside from the rearrangement of the words the similarity between Euler's summa

 rized and Boulliau's full statement is striking. In Ms 398, fol. 38v, Euler noted three
 numbers:

 Exactly the same numbers appear even in the same order on page 101 of Boulliau's

 book. Moreover, on the same folio Euler continued with:

 Luna Zodiacum absolvit tempore

 27 d: 7 H. 43'.

 Rursus vero ad Aphelium fertur
 27. d. 13. H. 12'[.]

 Mensis synodicus. 29. d. 12H 44'[.]

 Linea axem majorem in centras
 normaliter secans dicetur diacentrosf,]
 in foco - - - - diagasos[.]
 Luna ab Apogaeo singulis diebus movetur
 circa terram angulo 13° 3' 54".

 The meaning of the terms "diacentros" and "diagaeos" are explained only by Boulliau
 on page 103 of his book using a figure. And on page 157, Boulliau wrote:

 Luna verô ab Apogœo Ε movetur circa terram singulis diebus g.l3.'3."54.

 The agreement between Boulliau's and Euler's statements prove not only the latter's

 dependence on the former but also the close relationship between Ms 272 and the notes

 on folio 38v in Ms 398. This implies that Ms 272 most likely was composed in 1727,
 which confirms the perfect agreement with the estimation made by Kopelevic et al.
 (1962).

 thus driving Ρ into the motion

 S, the straight line ΑΡπ being

 the tangent passing through Ρ

 Concerning the theory of central forces, we know from Ms 180, fol. 2r, and Prop.
 74, Coroll. 4, of the "Mechanica" (cf. Euler 1736, Sect. 592) that Euler must have been

 acquainted with the paper of Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754) published 1717 in the
 Philosophical Transactions (cf. Moivre de 1717 ; Guicciardini 1995), wherein (p. 624) it

 is referred to the corresponding publications of Johann I Bernoulli (cf. Bernoulli 1712;
 Guicciardini 1995), John Keill (1671-1721) (cf. Keill 1708; Guicciardini 1995), and

 Jacob Hermann (1678-1733) (cf. Hermann 1716). When Euler started his position
 in the St. Petersburg Academy in June 1727 (cf. Fellmann 2007, p. 29), the most
 important Academy journals must have been available to him. Therefore, I assume,

 that he most probably knew the papers of Pierre Varignon (1654-1722) and others (cf.
 Bomie 1708) on central forces and on the determination of osculating radii as well
 (cf. Varignon 1703a,b,c, 1704,1705,1707a,b, 1712). All these publications led Euler

 to the frontier of scientific research of his time and provided him the then up to date
 state-of-the-art tools useful for treating the lunar problem.

 Finally, let me speculate even further about Euler's motive to put the focus of his

 research on the use of central forces to describe the Moon's motion. Eric J. Aiton

 showed (cf. Aiton 1989) that Johann I Bernoulli and Jacob Hermann successfully
 proved the inverse problem of central forces in 1710, which was published in the
 Paris Memoires of 1712 (cf. Hermann 1712; Bernoulli 1712; Guicciardini 1995). This

 was unquestionably an awesome demonstration of the power inherent in this method.

 The researches of Varignon were straightened to use multiple force centers for the

 determination of planetary orbits (cf. Varignon 1705; Aiton 1989, p. 52). Why could

 this approach not be successfully also for solving the lunar problem? If we inspect the

 Bernoulli paper of 1712, we find some analogies in Euler's first approaches in Ms 180

 and Ms 397, in particular concerning the method used to determine the centripetal
 force and the derivation of de Moivre's theorem (cf. Bernoulli 1712, pp. 529-532, and

 Fig. 2). Bernoulli and Varignon were without doubt the leading scientists with respect

 to the development of the theory of central force motions in the years between 1700
 and 1720 (cf. Costabel et al. 1992).

 4.2 Euler's theoretical equipment to tackle the lunar problem

 The sequence of Euler's records in Ms 397 reveals, that already in Basel he was deeply
 involved in transforming Newton's Principia into the analytic notation of rational

 Leonhard Euler's early lunar theories 1725-1752 257

 mechanics. In this process, he must have been confronted with Section IX "De Motu
 Corporum in Orbibus mobilibus, deque motu Apsidum" (The motion of bodies in

 mobile orbits, and the motion of the apsides, cf. Cohen 1999, pp. 534-545), of book
 I in Newton's Principia. Therein he would have read Newton's famous statement,
 that "the [advance of the] apsis of the moon is about twice as swift" (cf. Cohen 1999,

 p. 545) thus admitting the discrepancy by a factor of 2 between theory and observation.

 According to Euler's very first record in Ms 397 concerning the Moon's motion, this
 fact—I surmise—might probably have been Euler's motivation to begin a serious
 engagement with lunar theory, which lasted all his life. His first approach, however,

 was considerably directed by the theory of central force motion as reflected in Chapter

 V of his "Mechanica". At that time, the central key for Euler needed to describe the

 Moon's motion was the determination of the normal (centripetal) and tangential forces

 moving both the Moon in its orbit and the orbit around the center of force resulting

 in the rotating motion of the apsidal line. This is why he also studied extensively how

 to determine the osculating radius (cf., e.g., Ms 397, fol. 0 [i.e., inside of front cover],
 fol. 55v, 98v, 120v, and 206v).

 Euler formulated his first approaches to celestial mechanics in terms of central force

 motion combined with Huygens' theorem, applied to multiple acting force centers,

 which cause mobile orbits changing their form and position at any time due to varying

 radii of osculation. This strategy is explicable in his statements in the "Mechanica"
 (cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 83, 84, and 89):

 § 694. With regard to the figures that bodies describe under the action of given

 forces, it is not worth the effort to add more here, as in Physics and Astronomy,

 the hypotheses of centripetal forces other than those in proportion to the inverse

 square of the distances have no use. Yet in Astronomy, when a body must be
 considered to be acted on by several forces of this kind, of which one exercises

 a maximum influence on the body over the others, these extra forces, as the

 problem demands, do not have to be introduced into the calculation, as they only

 augment or diminish a little, that by which even the approximate motion of the
 body is known. Therefore in these cases the curve the body describes does not
 disagree much with an ellipse. For this reason, Astronomers usually consider
 the curve to be in the form of an ellipse, however one which is not fixed, but

 mobile, so that thus they consider the body moving in an ellipse which in turn is

 rotating around the focus. Hence the mobility of the orbits of the planets arise,
 where the lines of the apses continually move to another place. We will, when

 proceeding closer to the truth, besides the mobility of the axis, also consider the

 form of the ellipse as a variable. Therefore we will proceed in such a way, that -

 with respect to any element of the curve the body describes - we can determine

 the ellipse (having the focus at the center of force) from which this element is

 part of. Hence the position and the nature of the ellipse can become known.

 Moreover all these ellipses in turn have one of their foci in the center of forces,

 because the body is continually attracted towards it.

 §701. The theory of osculating ellipses is not to be confused with the motion

 of bodies in moving orbits, concerning which Newton and others after him have

 worked on. For here, however, we determine the very ellipse each element of the

 258 A. Verdun

 curve described by a body is part of. But, when the talk is about moving orbits,

 the very centripetal force is being investigated causing the body to move in a

 given curve which is rotating around the center of forces.

 §740. The curves described by bodies acted on by centripetal forces of this

 kind are hardly to be recognized in a different way, and it is not at all possible
 to determine their form without applying the considerations made above.
 Therefore investigations of centripetal forces of this kind have the maximum

 use for curves generated by some given conditions, and from which in turn,
 from the given centripetal forces, the curves themselves together with their
 properties can be derived. For the motions of heavenly bodies there occur so

 complex expressions of the forces acting on them, that none of their orbits could

 be determined at all, if these forces were - by chance - not in such a state, for

 which the centripetal force could has been found a posteriori.

 This may probably be the reason for the remarkable delay of the use and application

 of the equations of motion as given, e.g. by Jacob Hermann (cf. Hermann 1716, p. 57), a

 textbook Euler studied intensively as well. Euler seemed to be caught by the method of

 central forces as investigated by, e.g., his teacher Johann I Bernoulli, Jacob Hermann,

 and Pierre Varignon, which thus prevented him from recognizing the power of the

 equations of motion. This will be the essential step which Euler only took in the 1740s.

 4.3 Euler's deficiencies to cope with the lunar motion

 Euler's own words as cited above make clear that his first approaches to lunar theory
 were dominated by the problem of central force motion: equating the centrifugal forces
 (given by the osculating radius at any point of the body's trajectory and Huygens'
 theorem) with the gravity acting at this point by the central body yields the motion
 of the body. But what happens if there are two force centers (e.g., the Sun and the
 Earth) acting simultaneously on a third one (e.g., the Moon), one of them (e.g., the

 Earth) even in motion as well (e.g., moving around the Sun)? How then is the resulting
 central force (or its radial and tangential components) to be determined, or, which is

 the relevant osculating radius in this case? If this radius is changing for every element

 of the curve which the body describes, how can its resulting trajectory be found?
 These problems led Euler to the conflict between a mobile ellipse rotating around
 the common force center and a resulting ellipse changing its parameters (form and

 position) continuously. The presented documents reveal that Euler obviously struggled
 with this kind of problems.

 Actually, this problem is—as we know today—closely intertwined with the choice

 of an appropriate reference frame. Euler did not know yet that this could be an important

 issue. Only a few years later will he stumble on the crucial discovery which I call the
 principle of the transference of forces. If the Moon's motion is to be described in an

 earth-fixed reference frame, all the forces acting on it by the Sun and Moon have to

 be transferred in reverse direction to these bodies thus leaving the Earth at rest. He

 formulated this principle (Euler called it genuine method, "genuina methodus", cf.
 Euler 1736, Prop. 96, Schol. 2) in his "Mechanica" Euler 1736, Prop. 97), which was

 completed by 1734.1 will address this important development in part 2 of this series
 of papers, covering the years about 1730-1744.

 5 Conclusions

 Documents written by Euler between 1725 and 1730, presented and analyzed in this

 paper, reveal that he struggled considerably with different approaches to find a method

 or strategy by means of which a powerful lunar theory could be constructed. Most of his

 early approaches were not successful. Neither did he already use time parameterized

 equations of motion nor did he realize the importance of the choice of an appropriate

 reference frame in that early phase of the development of his researches. The theory

 of central forces, as formulated by Euler in terms of Leibnizian calculus, the use of
 Huygens' centrifugal principle, of de Moivre's and Keill's theorems, as well as the
 determination of the osculating radius, dominated his ideas due to his simultaneous

 transformation of Newton's Principia into the analytic language of rational mechanics.
 Euler was embedded in a tradition of mechanical and mathematical methods, which

 were prepared by his teacher Bernoulli, Hermann, and Varignon in such a way that

 his first steps emerging from this context may be judged as quite unspectacular with
 respect to innovative ideas. These approaches may be judged as inadequate to solve the

 problem of multiple central forces, on which Euler based his first theoretical approach

 to cope with the lunar problem. Nevertheless, Euler's first trials and ideas contained
 the nuclei which some time later led him to the concept of the osculating ellipse and

 to the principle of the transference of forces. This will be the subject of my next paper

 (part 2).

 Appendix A: The content of Ms 272

 In the short "Treatise on the Moon's motion", Euler describes the principal inequalities

 that may be observed in the motion of the Moon and its possible causes. The treatise

 reflects his studies of the relevant textbooks and his understanding of the problem.1

 In the first paragraph, Euler mentions three inequalities in the Moon's motion,

 namely in longitude, in latitude, and in altitude (i.e., distance from the Earth). Euler

 1 From a systematic point of view these inequalities in the Moon's motion are best explained, theoretically
 and quantitatively, in Moulton (1914), Chapter IX, in Beutler (2005a), Chapter 6, and in Beutler (2005b),
 Chapter 2.2.1, respectively.

 describes the first of them (concerning, as it does, the Moon's sidereal and synodic
 motions) which is confirmed by observations. The Moon moves neither uniformly
 along the Zodiac nor does it cover equal arcs in the ecliptic in equal time intervals.
 There are three such longitudinal inequalities, of which the first and second ones were

 known since Hipparchus (c. 190bc-c. 120bc), while the third one was noted first by
 Tycho de Brahe (1546-1601). The first of these longitudinal inequalities affects the
 Moon's periodic motion around the Earth and causes its non-uniform passing through
 the Zodiac. It depends on the Moon's distance from the Earth: the Moon's motion
 is growing faster when it becomes closer to the Earth, and it is slowing down when

 it goes further away. This inequality is periodically reset in the time interval starting

 from one apogee to the next, when the Moon is returning back to the same place. We

 now know that this so-called first inequality is caused by the equation of the center,
 (i.e., by the ellipticity of the Moon's orbit) having a period of 27.5581 days and an
 amplitude of 6.2815° (cf. Beutler 2005b, Table 2.3, p. 31).

 In the second paragraph, Euler explains the second longitudinal inequality, which

 was named evection by Ismael Boulliau (1605-1694) (cf. Boulliau 1645, Lib. Ill;
 Lynn 1908). It refers to the Moon's synodic motion and is periodically reset within
 a synodic month, namely from one conjunction of Moon and Sun to the next one.
 Characteristically, it sometimes vanishes and sometimes it is perceptible. If the syn
 odic line coincides with the apsidal line the maximum value of this second inequality
 is observed during the whole lunation. But if it is placed in medium longitudes the
 second inequality nearly vanishes. When the synodic line is changing its anomaly
 from 270° to 90° the second inequalities are decreasing from conjunction to opposi
 tion, but increasing from opposition to conjunction. The contrary holds if the synodic
 line proceeds from 90° to 270°. We can complete Euler's explanation by adding the
 evection's period of 31.8230 days and amplitude of 1.2759° or 1°16'33" (cf. Beutler
 2005b, Table 2.3, p. 31).

 In the third paragraph, Euler describes the third inequality in longitude which was

 called variation by Tycho. It depends only on the Moon's synodic motion and affects

 the motion of the Moon in such a way, that from conjunction to the first quadrature it

 is accelerated and from the quadrature to the opposition it is retarded. Then again from

 opposition to the second quadrature it is accelerated and from the second quadrature
 to the conjunction it is retarded. This is why this inequality is added to the Moon's
 motion when proceeding from the syzygies to the quadratures, but subtracted when

 the Moon moves from the quadratures to the syzygies. Again, we can add to Euler's

 statements that the variation has a period of 14.7670 days and an amplitude of 0.6638°
 or 39'50" (cf. Beutler 2005b, Table 2.3, p. 31).

 Euler devoted the forth paragraph to the inequality in latitude, caused by the Moon's

 orbital plane which deviates from the ecliptic plane (by about 5°). Considering them
 as great circles, astronomers often put them into one and the same plane. However,
 Tycho Brahe demonstrated by most accurate observations that the Moon's orbital

 plane does not take a constant angle with the ecliptic but it is inclined sometimes more

 and sometimes less with respect to this plane. In fact, the inclination of the Moon's
 orbit with respect to the ecliptic varies between about 5° and 5.3° (cf. Beutler 2005b,
 Figure 2.10, p. 27). According to Tycho's observations, Euler continues, it is certain

 that this inclination angle increases when the Moon is moving from the syzygies to the

 quadratures, but diminishes when proceeding from the quadratures to the syzygies.
 Furthermore, the intersections between the Moon's orbit with the ecliptic, the so-called

 nodes, are not always located at the same place in the sky, but they regress against the
 sequence of the signs. We may add, that the period of one revolution of the line of
 node is about 18.6 years.

 In the next paragraph, Euler mentions the inequality which depends on the variable
 distance of the Moon from the Earth. The Moon's position is sometimes closer and

 sometimes further away from the Earth. And even the point of maximum distance, the
 apogee, is not fixed, but—as may be concluded from observations—moves continu
 ously along the sequence of the signs (i.e., "in consequentia"). Even the excentricity
 of the Moon's orbit, conceived as difference between the maximum and minimum

 distance of the Moon from the Earth, is found to be subject to variation. It is largest

 when the apsidal line is coinciding with the syzygies, and smallest when the apsides

 are aligned with the quadratures. Indeed, the numeric excentricity of the lunar orbit
 might vary between 0.02 and 0.08 even on relatively short time scales (cf. Beutler
 2005b, Figure 2.8, p. 26).

 All these phenomena of the lunar motion, together with the motions oi the other
 planets and comets, were—according to Euler—most elegantly explained by the
 most sagacious Newton, who derived them from laws of motion when most of the
 astronomers had tried without success to find its cause. He succeeded in this explana

 tion by assuming this unique hypothesis that every body in the world is endowed with
 a force to attract the surrounding bodies in the inverse square ratio of their mutual

 distances. Actually this is a mere hypothesis, but because all phenomena might be
 derived most accurately from it with correct conclusions, there is no doubt that it
 is really true. This is why the attraction of the bodies in the world is—considered
 as phenomenon—generally accepted; however, its physical cause has not yet been
 discovered.

 Newton has proved, Euler continues, that the planets describe ellipses around the
 Sun which is located in one of its foci. It was Kepler who observed this for the first
 time, and then also Boulliau who derived it from observations but did not determine

 the motions of the planets correctly. Those astronomers attributed an elliptic orbit to
 the Moon similarly as to the primary planets. But due to the Moon's inequalities, as
 described above, its orbit is by no means an ellipsis. Therefore, they claimed that the

 Moon actually moves in an ellipsis, but one which is mobile, perhaps even changing
 its shape because the transverse axis and the excentricity sometimes increase and
 sometimes decrease. This is why Newton determined with capacious labor the motion

 of the apsides, the motion of the nodes, and the variation in the lunar orbit. Although

 it would be possible to find out the correct lunar orbit, hardly any use would result
 from this due to the excessively great complexity and unhandiness of the equations.

 Neither the position of the apsides nor the position of the nodes nor the motion of the

 Moon itself might be determined from it, Euler points out. Therefore, Euler admitted,

 he too will use that simplifying supposition of an elliptic lunar orbit.

 Finally, Euler closes his introduction with some statements relating to his own
 work. According to Euler, Kepler already attributed the cause for the inequalities
 in the Moon's motion to the Sun. But Newton first derived these inequalities with

 sufficient accuracy from the Sun's and Earth's double source of attraction. But because

 nobody knowledgable about the theory of centripetal forces was aware how difficult

 it is to determine the motion of a body driven by two force centers, one of them even

 being mobile, it is reasonable why Newton too determined the Moon's motion only
 approximatively. But because in many kinds of such propositions one justly might

 doubt whether the neglect of the least circumstance not will produce a big discrepancy
 in the solution, one should not rely too much on that matter. When Euler first dealt

 with that topic, he wrote, he found by calculation some things which seem to be useful

 for astronomy. Because he also found the magnitude of the Sun's attractive force to
 be much bigger than Newton did, major perturbances in the Moon's motion must

 consequently occur. This is why he will present his findings concerning this question
 in this treatise and will, as good as he can, determine the absolute perturbance of
 the Moon's motion from the known force of the Sun in order to be able to compare
 subsequently the theory with observations.

 From these last statements by Euler, one might conclude that he must have been

 concerned with the problem of lunar theory already for some time and that he must

 have made some progress in his investigation. Unfortunately, neither this unfinished

 manuscript nor any other manuscript of that time is preserved containing calculations
 which would confirm his claims. However, two things become clear from this manu

 script: 1. Newton's failure to describe the motion of the lunar apses became a serious
 motive for Euler to get into lunar theory, and 2. The determination of "the motion of

 a body driven by two force centers, one of them even being mobile" seemed to be the

 key for Euler to solve the lunar problem as described in the following documents.

 Appendix Β: The content of Ms 180

 This small unfinished treatise represents Euler's first theoretical approach to cope with

 the Moon's motion. As its title "On the motion of bodies driven by multiple central
 forces" reveals, Euler intended to apply the general solution of this kind of problem
 to the special case of the description of the Moon's orbit, identifying the two centers
 of force by the Earth and the Sun. There are entries in Euler's notebooks Ms 397 and

 Ms 398 showing that he was developing the problem of multiple central forces further

 (cf. Sect. E). In a first Lemma, Euler states Huygens' centrifugal theorem (cf. Huygens

 1673, 1703; Bomie 1708): Given a body (cf. Fig. 3) moving along an arbitrary curve
 AM and having in M the velocity corresponding to the altitude v, then the ratio

 between the normal force in M and the gravitational force [in M] corresponds to the

 ratio between the altitude ν and the half of the osculating radius MO. In a corollary, he

 Some years later (by 1734), Euler derived this theorem in Volume 1 of his "Mechan

 ica" (cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 70). In the second Lemma, Euler claims: If a body (cf. Fig.
 4) is moving along the curve AM then the ratio between the tangential force in M
 and the gravitational force (in M) is as the element or increment of the velocity's cor

 responding altitude, across the element Mm, to just this line element Mm itself. The

 demonstration is straightforward. Again, Euler restates this lemma mathematically in
 a separate corollary: Let Mm — d.v and Τ be the tangential force, then

 Ν =

 It may also be found in Euler's "Mechanica" (cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 70, Coroll. 3). Euler

 starts with the first problem: Determine the velocity of a body located anywhere in M

 [of its trajectory] being attracted to the center of force C. This problem and its solution

 together with the corollaries are treated by Euler in a similar way in his "Mechanica"

 (cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 74). Let AM be the body's trajectory, the body being in Μ, Μ Τ
 the tangent through M, CT the perpendicular from C to MT, MC = y,CT — p, and
 the osculating radius MO = r. Let the ratio between the central and the gravitational
 force in M be as an arbitrary function Ρ to 1. If the central force — AP, Euler finds
 the normal force (being central) as CT(p) to CM{y). Using Huygens' centrifugal
 theorem, the normal force becomes

 Euler gives an alternative solution as well. Let Mm — d.v be the line element of the

 body's trajectory. The tangential force may then be found by the ratio between CM(y)

 and MT (q) in such a way that the central force A Ρ to the tangential force is equal to

 Euler derives four corollaries from these findings. First, he substitutes Ρ = from
 Eq. (4) into Eq. (5) and obtains

 The equivalence of the triangles MNm and MTC yields MN(-dy) : Mm(ds) =

 Consequently, iv = —lip + tC or

 where ί denotes the logarithm to base 10. In a second corollary, Euler equates Eqs.
 (4) and (9), yielding de Moivre's theorem (cf. Moivre de 1717)

 As a third corollary Euler substitutes —ydy — q d.v into the integral of Eq. (5),

 obtaining ν = — f Ρ dy. If the central force is proportional to any power of y, Euler
 concludes in a fourth corollary, then Ρ = yn and thus

 omnia quae velocitates concernunt pro quacunque hypothesi"), Euler comments on

 this result in an euphoric style.

 Then Euler formulates the second problem: Determine the curve [i.e., the trajectory]

 which a body describes around the center of force being attracted in a given way. His
 solution is straightforward: Due to the fact that Ρ is a function given by CM(y), de
 Moivre's theorem defines the nature of the curve, or, since r — the trajectory is

 given by Ρ — 2β^· Euler closes this topic with two corollaries of minor importance.
 He then states the third problem: Determine the velocity in each place [of the trajectory]

 of a body attracted in a given way by two centers of force C and D. To solve it, Euler
 draws (cf. Fig. 6) the straight lines MC, MD, and the perpendiculars CT, DP to the
 tangent MP through M. He sets CM = y, DM = z, CT = p, DP = t, MT = q,
 MP = x, and the osculation radius in M = r. He defines the ratio between the central

 force, with which M is attracted by C, and the gravitational force as Ρ to 1, and the

 ratio between the [central] force, with which M is attracted by D, and the gravitational
 force as β to 1. Therefore the central force by C is = A Ρ and by D is = AQ. Then
 the normal and tangential forces produced by C become = ^—R- and = the

 normal force becomes (according to Lemma I) = resulting in -ψ + ψ — ψ.

 which the body describes due to the attraction of two centers [of force]. To solve this

 problem, Euler refers to the Eqs. (13) and (14) and equates them:

 This is what we now call a first order integro-differential equation. There was no

 abrupt end of this manuscript.

 Appendix C: The relevant records in Ms 397

 Actually, Euler's first notebook Ms 397 is a draft version of a larger treatise on analyti

 cal mechanics, showing Euler deeply involved with the re-formulation and translation

 of the content of Newton's Principia into the analytical language based on Leibnizian

 calculus. The text is structured into Propositions, Scholia, Corollaries, etc. It was pub
 lished in Mikhailov (1965), pp. 38-62. At the beginning only rarely, then more and

 more frequently, it is interrupted by other topics concerning astronomy, mathematics,

 and even music theory. These notes are, however, rather fragmentary, sometimes con

 tinuing and referring to each other, sometimes standing alone. The records concerning

 celestial mechanics and, in particular, lunar theory, clearly reflect Euler's approach to

 tackle the problem: there are trials, errors, and dead ends. Often Euler takes up one

 and the same problem for several times, restating it over and over. It is hard to recog

 nize a central theme. Sometimes Euler is concerned with planetary motion and solar

 theory, sometimes with lunar theory or with the general three body problem. I will try

 to put together the relevant fragments essential for the formation and development of

 his early lunar theories. The records may be grouped together according to two main

 topics: the Moon's motion in its orbit (cf. Ms 397, fol. 124r-126r) and the motion of

 this orbit around the center of force resulting in the motion of the apsidal line (cf.
 Ms397, fol. 25r, 25v, 34v, 125r-126v). Euler treated these two problems separately at

 that time. In addition, he developed the motion of the Earth around the Sun (so-called
 Solar theory), and even more generally, he already studied the motion of a body around

 the central body when its central force is moving, thus changing the resulting orbit (cf.

 Ms 397, fol. 121v-122v, 125v-126v). From the theoretical point of view, this topic is
 intimately connected with lunar theory because we learn from it important procedures

 and results Euler applied to lunar theory. This is why this issue is treated here as well.

 Finally, there are records in Ms 397 which are difficult to assign one of the topics
 mentioned above. A most prominent example is Euler's first trial with the general
 three-body-problem. I will present this topic separately at the end of this section.

 Cl: The relevant records of Ms397 concerning the Moon's motion in its orbit

 The notes on lunar theory start on folio 124r with Euler's statement of the central
 "Problema" (cf. Fig. 7):

 Sit Τ terra[,] L luna, S sol[;] requiritur motus lunae.

 "Let Τ be the Earth, L the Moon, and S the Sun. Find the motion of the Moon."

 This question is a special case of the general three-body-problem: given three celestial
 bodies, determine their motions due to the mutual gravitational forces. Applied to
 the Sun-Earth-Moon system this is the most general (and, we may add, by far the

 shortest) way to formulate this famous problem. The principle solution is similar to the

 one Euler used in the manuscript Ms 271, which I will present in part 2: Determination

 of the relevant force components acting on the Moon and equating the centripetal with
 the centrifugal force according to Huygens' formula. First, Euler considers the three
 bodies having masses T, L, and S, respectively, and assumed to be situated in one and
 the same plane. He sets ST — a, Τ Q = x,TL = y, LS = ζ,ΤΡ = ρ, and LP = q.

 The forces acting on the Earth and on the Moon by the Sun are ^ and φ, respectively.

 The components of the latter force along LT and LV arc -ρ- and = , respectively.
 The difference between the forces acting on Earth and Moon by the Sun along the line
 LM (which is parallel to Τ S and LV) is LM = % — Now Euler gives without
 any derivation two formulae for the ratios LN : LR and LN : Ν R, which he later will

 this missing derivation by using a redrawn detail of Fig. 7.

 In addition to Euler's notations I introduce ad interim the straight lines u and w (cf.
 Fig. 8) and abbreviate t = sjy1 — x2 as Euler will do so below. Then the following
 relations hold:

 The tangential and normal forces are reduced or increased by the Sun's force acting

 is attracted by the Earth with the force ψ, which increases the normal component by

 and reduces the tangential component by Calling the Moon's velocity v, the

 curve element d.v, and the osculating or curvature radius r, the tangential and normal
 forces become and respectively. At this point, Euler applies the equation of

 motion (cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 20). Using the relations d,v = ^ and r = the

 yields the equation of motion for the normal component depending only on the dis
 tances and masses of the bodies acting on the Moon:

 Euler's records associated with this topic are much more fragmentary than the concise

 notes of the previous one. The various entries on different folios often do not match

 together. Many of the intermediate formulae are not derived but are results gained from

 anywhere. However, I try to trace the main steps as given by the numbering of the
 folio in Ms 397 (which is not necessary identical with their chronological order) thus

 showing Euler's progress in dealing with the problem of the Moon's apsidal motion.
 We must leave some results provisional and unexplained due to the fact that there is

 not enough information contained in this notebook to be able to reconstruct all these
 results and formulae without any remaining gaps. Nevertheless, where it was possible,

 I have done so and have referred in such cases again to Volume I, Chapter V, of Euler's
 "Mechanica", Euler (1736).

 Euler opens this topic by stating the following problem:

 Invenire vim quae facit ut corpus in orbe mobili moveatur.

 "Find the force causing a body to move in a mobile orbit." The sequence of records
 in Ms 397 associated with this topic reveals that the term "orbe mobili" (mobile orbit)

 means the lunar elliptic orbit rotating around the center of force being in one focus,
 i.e., the Earth. We witness here Euler taking up Section IX, on the motion of bodies
 in mobile orbits, and the motion of the apsides, of Newton's Principia. To solve it,
 Euler sets the ratio between the orbital velocity ("velocitas orbis") and the velocity of
 the radius vector ("velocitas radii vectoris"), i.e. the angular velocity of the rotating
 orbit, as m : η. Furthermore, he sets m + η — I, and uses CL — y, Lr = dx, and
 Ir = dy (cf. Fig. 10). Then the ratio between the force acting in the immobile orbit
 ("vis in orbe immobili"), causing the Moon to move in its orbit, and the force acting
 in the mobile orbit ("vis in orbe mobili"), causing the Moon's elliptic orbit to move
 around the center of force being in one focus, is given by

 At that time Euler seemed to be already acquainted with this formula because he wrote

 it without any derivation. He solves the relation (Eq. 44) for

 Now Euler supposes the centripetal force being equal to the inverse square of the
 distance y and refers to de Moivre's theorem (cf. Euler's "Mechanica", Euler 1736,

 addition the force Τ be given. If these forces are given and the motion of the apsides

 On folio 125v, we see Euler restating the problem again (see Fig. 12): Find the
 forces retaining both the body in any mobile orbit A Β and around the center Ο of

 the osculating circle. Let ν be the velocity of the body L in the immobile orbit and u the

 orbit's [angular] velocity. The tangential force in the immobile orbit is then given by

 the tangential force in the mobile orbit by vàv+vàu+fàv+uàu. The normal force

 in the immobile orbit is given by r — and the normal force in the mobile orbit by

 vv+2v"+uu. Thus, the ratio between the tangential components in the immobile and
 the mobile orbits becomes υ dv : υ dv + ν du + udv + uu. If μ = ην, then this ratio

 becomes — ν : ν + 2nv + nnv — I : I + η . Therefore, the ratio between the normal

 components in the immobile and the mobile orbits is vv : (v + u)2, and with u = nv,

 -2
 it becomes 1 : 1 + η .

 In Ms 397, fol. 126r and 126v, there are two fragmentary records which also most

 probably concern the motion in a mobile orbit. However, it is quite hard to identify

 their meaning and in what respect they are connected with this topic. For the sake of
 completeness, I will present them as they are without any interpretation.

 Euler denotes the decrement of the orbit's axis by dp and uses it in a decreasing
 sense. Then he sets de = y, ch = q, the axis = b,cf = b— y, fg = dx, de = t, and
 he = ν (cf. Fig. 13). Then he claims that the ratio Lacb : L fde (in which the axis
 moves according to the signs, i.e. "in consequentia") is as t dx : ν dx — q dp. And the

 sinus of the angle d is given by

 On folio 126 ν, both the figure and the formulae are even more puzzling. Euler did

 not define any symbols nor does he give any other hint as to what is going on. There
 are only some "stand-alone" relations. I speculate that they have something to do with
 the motion in a mobile orbit MA rotating around the center of force S (cf. Fig. 14).
 Euler defines LSPp = rect and IqPp = sST, then he notes the following relations:

 C3: The relevant records of Ms 397 concerning the general central force motion

 During the years 1725 until 1730 the problem of central force motion was one of Euler's

 main research topics, not only in the context of general mechanics, but primarily in
 the context of celestial mechanics. There are at least five unpublished manuscripts
 by Euler written at that time addressing that issue (cf. Kopelevic et al. 1962, pp.
 64-65, No. 178, 180, 181, 185, and 186). In addition, Ms 167 contains chapters that
 are also devoted to this matter. It is important to understand Euler's first approaches

 to lunar theory principally as a problem of central force motion. His main task in that

 period was to transform the corresponding Propositions in Newton's Principia into the

 analytic language of rational mechanics and thus to develop mathematically the theory
 of central force motion "from scratch". I will therefore comment here only on some

 "chapters" from Euler's first notebook, that are related to that topic and that represent

 his theoretical equipment, i.e. analytical mechanics, to tackling the lunar problem.

 There are twelve chapters in Ms 397 on free and constrained motion of bodies in

 vacuo or in a resistant medium, but only four of them are related to the free central force

 motion problem. Unfortunately, the figures to which Euler refers in the margins are

 missing throughout. He began his notebook with a carefully written chapter entitled

 "De Motu Corporum à vi quacunque centrali agitatorum" (On the motion of bodies
 which are agitated by an arbitrary central force) and opens this chapter with three
 "definitiones":

 I. A central force is a force with which a body is attracted towards any fixed point

 or from which it is repulsed. In the former case, we call it centripetal force, in the

 latter centrifugal force.

 Π. A mutative force ("vis mutatrix", Euler's neologism?) is a force which changes
 the speed of a moving body, i.e., either increases or decreases it. In the former
 case, we call it an accelerating, in the latter case a retarding force. NB: This force

 only changes the speed, leaving the direction of the motion unchanged.

 III. The central force may be resolved into its components ("laterales"), namely in
 one whose direction is tangential to the curve describing the motion, and in one

 whose direction is normal to the other, calling the former tangential force, but the
 latter normal force.

 This is followed by three propositions including demonstrations, nine corollaries,
 and two scholia. The next chapter concerns the motion of a body when no mutative

 force is acting ("De Motu corporum vi nulla existente imitatrice"). In subsequent chap

 ters Euler develops a method to find the mutative force when the trajectory described

 by the body and the central force are given ("Methodus datis curva et vi centrali inve

 niendi vim mutatricem") and he describes the time of revolution of a body rotating

 around any center and driven by any mutative force ("De Temporis periodicis corpo
 rum circa centrum aliquod gyrantium, quacunque existente vi mutatricem"). All these

 chapters were written in a textbook style and reflect Euler's state-of-the-art knowl
 edge on central force mechanics. They were published by Gleb K. Mikhailov in 1965
 (cf. Mikhailov 1965, pp. 38-62), which is why there is nc need to present them here
 again.

 His research on central force motion are continued on folio 121v of Ms 397. Let,

 respectively, M and r be the mass and radius of the Earth moving in an elliptic orbit

 around the body S with mass S [sic!] (cf. Fig. 15). Let A and Β be the apo- and percen

 ter, respectively, and SA — a, S M = y, and S Ρ = ρ perpendicular to the tangent line

 through M. Let further ν and Κ be the altitudes that correspond to the velocities of M

 and of a body on the Earth's surface, respectively. Without any derivation (which may
 be found—with correct reverse signs—in Ms 273, fol. lr. I postpone this derivation
 to the next paper when the manuscript Ms 273 will be discussed in full length), Euler
 states:

 υ = Κ +

 rrSy — rrSa

 May

 He proceeded with his calculations and, at the end of the folio, recognized, that the
 second term of this equation has the wrong sign. Having discovered his error, Euler
 cancelled all his calculations on that folio and restarted on the next folio 122r anew,

 where he changed (overstriked) four times the plus sign into a minus sign. If υ = ~~

 Using this result, he determines the length of the major axis AB:

 rrS — MaK rrS — MaK

 Let Mm — ds, then the time element, corresponding to d.ç given by is thus

 area as A, the total time of revolution then becomes = -^jx· Using Eqs. (68) and (67)

 TtaarrS / MaK

 the time of revolution becomes

 2 A narrS / Ma

 ajK 2rrS — 2MaK V rrS — MaK

 The last two and—consequently—all the following results are faulty because the area

 of an ellipsis is given by the product of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, but Euler

 used instead the major and semi-minor axes, resulting in an error of a factor 2 in the
 denominator. This might be the consequence of a misplaced correction by Euler: after

 having found the length of the major axis, he stated:

 Inveniatur axis minor est 4p = ^rrS-iMaK

 In fact, without cancelling the "2", this formulae would have given the correct
 semi-major axis as it should have been used afterwards. In addition, Euler called it
 misleadingly "axis minor", instead of major axis. However, if the time of revolution
 is required in seconds of time, Euler expresses a and r in Rhinelandian or Prussian
 feet ("scrupulis pedis Rhenani", corresponding 0.313853497 meters), so in this units
 it becomes

 2 This is probably the very first definition of the symbol π by Euler used to express what we now call
 Ludolph's number (Mattmiiller 2010, p. 185). He used this kind of definition also in Ms 167 and Ms 273,
 which will be presented in part 2. In his "Mechanica", which Euler finished in 1734, he defined π in the

 same way as we use it today, namely as the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its perimeter: "Posita
 ratione diametri ad peripheriam 1 : π", cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 76, Coroll. 2).

 On folio 125v, Euler formulated the following theorem: A body moves in an ellipse

 around the focus S, in which the attractive force is located. In such a way the absolute

 force in S increases, the body L will then immediately revolve in another ellipse of

 which the major axis becomes shorter than before. Euler re-formulates this theorem
 using Fig. 16. Let M and r be the Earth's mass and radius, respectively, S the mass of
 the central body S, LS — y, and υ the altitude corresponding velocity of the body L.
 The major axis of the orbit being = (cf. Eq. 76). Supposing S is increasing,

 Finally, Euler evaluates the result (cf. Eq. 74) numerically assuming the Earth's radius
 r to be 20302353000 Rhinelandian feet, yielding for the time of revolution t in time
 seconds

 Supposing the Moon's synodic time of revolution to be = 2360580 seconds, which is

 27days 7 h 43 min and corresponds to the value given in Newton's Principia (Lib. Ill,
 Prop. XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX), and setting M — S, Euler finds for the Moon's major
 axis b = 2435396100 Rhinelandian feet or 119.952 Earth radii.

 then the growing absolute force in S diminishes Srr^yv, which is why the absolute
 force is decreasing the orbit's major axis. And, in contrary, a decreasing attractive force

 increases the orbit's major axis. Euler proves this theorem in the following way on folio

 126r: Let b and c be the major and minor axes, respectively, and ρ the perpendicular
 SP, which is given by

 (79)

 The following demonstration depends crucially on this equation. Its derivation,
 however, may be found some folios earlier in the notebook, namely on folio 88v and
 120v. On folio 88v, Euler noted, without comment, the formula

 r =

 where (see, Fig. 17) ab = t, ac = z, ad — r, sin Lbac = f, and the angles at b
 and c are right angles. This equation is a consequence of the law of cosines (cosine
 rule), applied to the triangle abc and of the fact, that the straight line be is equal
 rf — r sin Lbac, which may be proved by geometric construction. Using this result
 and identifying a with P, b with T, c with M, and d with A, so that ad — r in Fig. 17
 corresponds to AP = y in Fig. 18, Euler derives on folio 120v the parameter ρ as
 follows (see Fig. 18): Let AP = y, AB — a, and BP — ζ be a certain function of y.
 The cosine rule of the triangle AB Ρ yields

 C4: Miscellaneous records in Ms 397 related to lunar theory

 On folio 123r, just one folio before the very page where Euler formulated the general

 problem of lunar theory (cf. Sect. CI and Fig. 7), he treated the general three-body

 problem: Given three attracting globes A, B, C (cf. Fig. 19), find the attraction of each

 one. Let a and β be the absolute forces acting in S by Λ and in C by A, respectively,
 and let γ be the mutual force between Β and C. Considering A A as Ba, Β D as Aa,
 ΒI as C γ, C H as By,C G as Αβ, and AF as C/3. These lines represent the forces with

 BK, which intersects AC in L. This is done for Ε F and GH as well. The following
 derivations are proved by Euler on folio 29r and 32v-33r as well as in his unpublished
 manuscript Ms251, which was published in Knobloch (1992). Euler states:

 In 1992, Eberhard Knobloch published a paper on Euler's earliest study of the three
 body-problem (cf. Knobloch 1992). It concerns Euler's manuscript fragment Ms 251,
 which was written in the 1730ies (according to Kopelevic et al. 1962, p. 79) and
 which was published by Knobloch in the original Latin and in a translated German
 version. Knobloch claimed, however, that this manuscript was written around 1730

 and that he could not verify a hint by Otto Volk (1892-1989). According to Volk, this

 general three-body-problem was already formulated by Euler in his [first] notebook
 of 1727. Knobloch was guest professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences in St.
 Petersburg in 1984 and—thanks to this visit—was able to describe the contents of
 all of Euler's notebooks in 1989 (cf. Knobloch 1989). Knobloch did not realize that

 Volk's claim in fact was right, as it was shown above. However, Knobloch must have

 recognized these notebook entries as well, although he assigned folio 123r of Ms 397

 in Knobloch (1989), pp. 300-301, to the field of "mechanics", and not to "astronomy",

 thus considering its content as a mechanical instead of an astronomical problem as
 Euler probably did in Ms 251 and as Knobloch himself did as well already in the

 abstract of his paper:

 Euler was very interested in the astronomical three body problem since the
 beginning of his scientific career up to the end of his life [...] (emphasis added)

 Appendix D: The relevant records in Ms 398

 As mentioned above, the second notebook Ms 398 has the character of a waste book.

 The records are thus more fragmented and much less commented than in Ms 397. The

 most coherent entries concern the problem of central force motion. This is why they

 are worth to be presented here as well according to three major topics which are most

 carefully elaborated by Euler.

 Dl: The relevant records of Ms 398 concerning the general central force motion

 Again, Euler aims at obtaining equations for the orbital parameters and its differentials

 due to a central force in terms of the instantaneous osculating radius. Let G be (in fact,
 Euler used the symbol A instead of G) the gravitational force and V the centripetal
 force acting on M by C (cf. Fig. 20). Let CM = y, rm = dy, CP = p, and assume
 the velocity ν in M equal to the corresponding altitude [of free fall]. Then (cf. Euler

 1736, Prop. 71, Coroll. 1, where Ρ = ^) A : dy — V : —du, thus

 — dt) =

 due to the gravitational force. Therefore,

 At this point Euler recognizes an error by a factor of 2 when adding the comment

 "should be" (debet est)

 1736, Prop. 73, Sect. 578, and Prop. 74, Sect. 587) and where he derived it more
 elegantly using a dynamic approach with the equation of motion. Let υ be the velocity
 corresponding altitude in M, CM = y, C Ρ = ρ, Μ Ν — dx, Νm = dy, Mm = ds,

 and the osculating radius MO —r = ^. From the geometry of Fig. 21 it may easily
 be seen that mn = ^,mv = nv = and Mv = r'^. Then Euler
 compares the time intervals used to cover the distances Mm and Mv, which must be

 the same, if the associated velocities are appropriately matched, so that this kinematic
 approach yields

 D2: The relevant records of Ms 398 concerning the relative motion of two bodies

 Actually, this topic is connected with the motion in a mobile orbit. It is convenient,

 however, to present it separately because this issue treated here by Euler for the very
 first time probably leads to the principle of the transference of forces, which I will

 analyze in the next paper. Euler starts with the following proposition [I]: Given the

 uniform motions of two bodies A and Β (cf. Fig. 22) along the directions AM and BN,

 respectively. Find the relative motion of body B, or, the motion as it appears when

 observed from body A. The solution is straightforward by a geometrical construction:

 When A has arrived in M, the body Β will have reached N. Conjoin the lines A Β and
 MN. Ex A draw the straight line AO parallel to Μ Ν which will end in O, which is
 the relative position of body Β corresponding to the true place Ν. Moreover, the line

 Β Ο represents the motion of body Β as seen from A and its (relative) velocity. In a
 Corollary [I] Euler addresses the principle of superposition: Due to NO = AM the
 line β Ο is the diagonal of the rectangle Ν BP Ο being composed by the two laterals

 Β Ν and BP, which are produced by the forces respectively by the motions of the
 bodies Β and A. And in Corollary II he adds, that the relative motion is performed

 in a straight line. In proposition II Euler is concerned with the motion of a body in
 an ellipsis which is subject to a uniform rectilinear motion of its focus. Let A be the

 attracting central body and M a body moving with such a velocity around A that it

 describes an ellipsis MBC (cf. Fig. 23). One asks for the ellipsis and the position of its
 axis described by the body M if the body A is set in motion along the line A Ε with a

 given uniform velocity. Euler did not solve this problem, but formulates proposition III
 instead: Let body A move along the line A Ε and body M describe an ellipsis around
 A (cf. Fig. 24). One asks for the ellipsis and the position of its axis the body M will

 describe if the direction of the central body A is altered into the line Ε F by a given

 [uniform] velocity. Euler seemed not to be able to solve this problem successfully at

 that time. He only gave a short speculative description of what is going on. After the

 body A has reached Ε it would proceed further to H. But now a second motion along
 EG happens in such a way that the former will be destroyed, and one may ask—at
 least for the case that the body is at rest—whether an ellipsis will result (it will be an

 ellipsis, Euler claims, if the body has started to move in a straight line).

 D3: Miscellaneous records in Ms 398 related to lunar theory

 Fol. 38v and fol. 50r of Ms 398 contain records which are strongly correlated with
 Ms 272 (cf. Sect. A). Euler summarizes the principle data and phenomena of the
 Moon's motion. On folio 38v, he noted:

 Leonhard Euler's early lunar theories 1725-1752 291

 The Moon moves through the zodiac in the time interval of 27d7h43'. On the
 other hand the Moon needs 27 days 13 h 12 min from apogee to apogee (Euler
 mistakenly wrote "Aphelium"). The synodic month lasts 29d12h44'. When the
 synodic line (i.e., the syzygial line) coincides with the apsidal line the synodic
 inequalities will be maximal. If the syzygies ("synodus") will happen in the

 quadratures, there are no inequalities of the second kind. From the conjunction to

 the first quadrature they [the inequalities] have to be added to the Moon's motion.

 From quadrature to the opposition they have to be subtracted. They have to be
 added once again from the opposition to the quadrature, and subtracted from

 the quadrature to the conjunction. This is the third kind of inequality observed
 by Tycho. The line perpendicular to the major axis is called "diacentros" if it

 intersects in the center, [otherwise] "diagœos" if it intersects in the focus. From
 the apogee onwards the Moon covers each day the angle 13°3/54" around the
 Earth.

 On folio 50r we find the following entries:

 The motion of the lunar apogee "in consequentia" [i.e., in the order of the signs]
 amounts to 3°3' in each revolution. The major axis ("axis transversus") of the
 Moon's orbit amounts according to the value corrected by Tycho to 121 Earth

 radii. The Earth's perimeter is 123249600 Parisian feet according to the French.
 The monthly revolution period of the Moon is 27d7h43'5". The daily motion
 [i.e., rotation period] of the Earth is 23h56', of the Moon 27d7h43'5" (I skip
 the data of other solar system bodies). The Earth's radius is 19615800 Parisian
 feet.

 Appendix Ε: The records in Ms 397 and Ms 398 concerning the motion in a mobile
 orbit due to two simultaneously acting force centers

 There are records in Euler's first two notebooks that document the very early moment

 when Euler tried to combine the concepts of central force motion, of the mobile orbit,

 and of the simultaneously acting force centers, concepts, which he treated in previous
 entries as separate problems. This approach, I may speculate, led Euler to the concept
 of the so-called osculating ellipse, which he defined and refined in his "Mechanica"
 until 1734 (cf. Euler 1736, Prop. 83, Schol. 2, and Prop. 84, Schol. 1). The notebook
 entries in Ms 397 and Ms 398 concerning this topic complement one another, thus

 proving their simultaneous emergence with respect to the dating of these records into
 the years 1727-1728.

 On folios 45r and 44v of Ms 398 Euler tries to describe the motion of a body within

 a mobile orbit, i.e. an orbit changing its shape, position, and orientation with respect

 to an inertial reference frame, thus mimicing, e.g., an apsidal motion or a variation

 of orbital parameters, as we would call it today. Euler states the problem as follows

 (cf. Fig. 25): A body is moving in the curve AMm around the centers Ο and o, being
 either at rest or mobile. (The meaning of this, as it will turn out from the following

 context, is that Ο actually is one of two force centers which is moving uniformly on

 a straight line from Ο to o.) One asks for the motion of the body in the moving curve

 i.e. the gravity, be as V to A. Let the velocity in AM be equal to the corresponding

 Draw the line Ms perpendicular to om. Then A : V = ms : —du, and thus

 Furthermore, the ratio between Mn(Mm) and rn is as the velocity Vν to the element

 namely Mm : m = 2v : —du, thus

 topic in order to understand the meaning of the symbols introduced by him for this

 purpose. In Ms 397, fol. 132v, and Ms 398, fol. 43r, Euler defined the straight lines
 of the Figs. 27 and 28 illustrating the central force motion of L (Luna) due to two
 simultaneous acting force centers Τ (Terra) and S (Sol) in the cases where Τ is the

 center of the osculating radius in L and where it is not, respectively. For the former

 case, he wrote the parameters in parentheses.

 To find the distance Τ R of the osculating center from Τ, Euler derives the equations

 Leonhard Euler's early lunar theories 1725-1752 295

 Let V be the centripetal force in L, A the gravity, and r the osculating radius in L
 (not to confuse with the point r marked in the figures). Further let c be the altitude

 corresponding velocity of the body Τ and ν the velocity of the body L. The Eq. 130

 between the Moon L (Luna), the
 Earth Τ (Terra) and the Sun S

 osculating radius R in L

 which is in accordance with Eq. (144) if t and dt are substituted correspondingly.

 Euler continued this line of thought on folio 202v of Ms 397 (cf. Fig. 29). He starts
 with the following definitions: AL = a, LB = b, the velocity of L = v, the velocity

 of Γ = c, LC = x, LQ — z- He then defines the differentials Tt — dr, LI = iL^L,
 and Im = dz- Using the equations

 Leonhard Euler's early lunar theories 1725-1752 299

 Now Euler wants to determine the Moon's velocity in terms of the parameters intro
 duced above and of these new ones: Lp = q, ST = e, SL = y, LT = w, thus
 Sp = *Jyy — qq, Τ ρ = *Jww — qq, and Jww — qq + e — ^Jyy — qq. For this
 purpose he compares the distances LT — w and It between the Moon and the Earth
 at a given epoch and after elapsing a short time element, respectively. He obtains

 w./vvdr2 dW2 I 21dwdr 14dr2

 It = V cc w = = . (162)

 Using Keill's theorem xdz = and the relative motions m and η introduced earlier

 in the notebook (cf. Sect. C2) Euler derives a series expansion of v, which he left,
 however, unfinished:
