 1 Part I: A review

 1.1 Introduction

 One may reasonably question the value of yet another discussion of this
 famous Mesopotamian tablet. However, recent discussions by Eleanor Robson1 and

 Communicated by : Alexander Jones.

 1 Robson (2001, 2002a, 2002b).

 To the great sorrow of his coauthors and many other colleagues, friends and relatives, John Britton died

 suddenly when this paper was in the last stages of preparation. He was very pleased with the final version,

 which he was reviewing when he passed away. In completing the article, the coauthors, with the kind

 assistance of Claudine Britton, made every effort to maintain the text as John had last seen it and preserve

 a sense of his presence throughout. We dedicate this article to his memory.

 This paper came together as a result of a seminar led by Zoe Misiewicz under the supervision of Alexander
 Jones, held at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW), an affiliate of New York University
 (NYU), New York, NY on March 3, 2010. Part I was largely completed by Britton, but with corrections
 and substantial improvements contributed by his fellow authors. Part II was a collective composition .

 Joran Friberg,2 suggest that a dispassionate review of what is known, suspected, and

 conjectured about this unique text may be worthwhile. This article is divided into two

 part. In Part I, we survey the historical development of the current understanding of
 the mathematical content of the text and estimate its likely manner of calculation and

 unbroken extent. In Part II, we attempt to place the text in its mathematical context

 and present some new perspectives based on comparisons with other texts from the
 same period and region.

 At the outset, a few words about terminology and notation may be helpful. By

 "Babylonian", we refer to scholar-scribes and their pupils residing in central and
 southern Mesopotamia and environs and using cuneiform script in their writings.

 Babylonian mathematical texts employ a uniquely powerful system of numerical nota-

 tion, which consisted of "digits" ranging from 1 to 59 and a place- value system in which

 successive digits from right to left represented successively higher powers of 60. The

 notation did not distinguish between integers and fractions, and absolute magnitudes
 had to be determined from contexts.

 Digits were depicted by combinations of two signs, angled wedges K denoting

 tens followed by vertical wedges I denoting units, arranged in tiers of not more
 than three,3 a feature which allowed instant recognition without counting. In Old

 Babylonian (OB) mathematical texts, an intermediary "zero" was conventionally indi-

 cated, if at all, by omission, either of tens or units or both. This led to frequent errors,
 such as confusing 50,6 and 56 as we shall see, which by Late-Babylonian times (ca.,

 -600) had led to the insertion of two small stacked angled wedges ^ as a separation

 sign4 to signal either a complete missing digit or the absence of tens, when a digit
 lacking units was followed by one lacking tens as in the example just noted.

 Different conventions have been adopted for transcribing and translating

 Babylonian numbers. In transcriptions, we use spaces as in the Babylonian originals

 to reflect missing digits or tens, and transcribe digits which lack units as 10, 20, 30, . . .

 etc. In translations, we follow Neugebauer's convention, separating digits by commas,

 translating missing digits by "0", and when the magnitude is known separating the

 integer and fractional parts of numbers with a semi-colon (";").

 Division in Babylonian arithmetic was accomplished by multiplying the dividend

 by the reciprocal of the divisor. Consequently "regular numbers", whose reciprocals
 have terminating sexagesimal expressions, play a prominent role. Such numbers con-

 tain only the prime factors 2, 3, and 5 comprising 60 and consequently are expressible
 as N = 2a - 3h • 5C (a, b , and c being integers).

 Although a minor point of probably hopeless protest, dates cited here follow the
 "long chronology" affirmed by Huber et al. (1982), in which 1 Hammurapi= 1848
 BCE, 56 years earlier than according to the "middle chronology" still widely used

 2 Friberg (2007).

 3 In formal arithmetic; less formal notation sometimes used two tiers of units for "7" and "8".

 4 H0yrup (2002, p. 1 5, n 1 9) notes two texts from Susa, TMS XII and XIV, which use the same (!) separation
 sign to signify the absence of units (TMS XII) or tens (TMS XIV) in otherwise unambiguous numbers, in
 contrast to the later usage. Consequently he doubts that these should be interpreted as intermediary "zero"s.

 by Assyriologists despite being quite certainly wrong.5 Given the strength of Huber's

 analysis and the quality of his collaborators,6 one might expect historians of mathe-

 matics to at least alert their readers to the existence of this issue, but for the most part

 dates based on the untenable "middle chronology" continue to dominate contemporary

 discussions of OB mathematics without qualification.

 Plimpton 322 is an OB mathematical table text, of uncertain provenance. It was

 purchased by George Plimpton in 1922 or 1923 from the dealer Edgar Banks, and
 bequeathed to Columbia University in 1936, where it now resides in the Rare Book

 and Manuscript Library in the Butler Library (Robson, 2001, 17 Iff). Its name derives

 from its entry in Mendelsohn's catalogue of the university's cuneiform tablets, which
 describes it as follows:7

 322. Clay tablet, left-hand edge broken away, bottom of right-hand corner, and
 a piece of columns 3 and 4 chipped off; fairly well preserved, dark-brown.
 8.8 x 12.5 cm; on obverse 4 columns with 16 lines, reverse blank. Content:
 Commercial account. No date.

 According to Banks,8 the tablet's provenance was "Senkereh", ancient Larsa, and

 Robson notes (2001, p. 172; 2002a, p. 110) that its headings, rightmost column and
 landscape format are similar to characteristics of administrative tablets from Larsa

 written between 1878 and 1850. Goetze (Neugebauer and Sachs 1945, pp. 146-151)

 assigned the text provisionally to "group 1" from Larsa,9 but noted (Neugebauer and

 Sachs 1945, p. 147, n353) that it "may or may not belong here". H0yrup (2002, pp. 337,

 386) notes that its orthography "points to group 6 with at least as high plausiblity as

 group 1" and thinks the text more likely belongs with texts from the periphery, where
 most of the texts which utilize the Diagonal Rule10 originate. However, two texts
 from the Sch0yen collection (MS 3052 and MS 3971), attributed by Friberg (2007,

 5 Huber et al. (1982) showed that the "long chronology" agrees far better with both month-length data
 from OB reigns and data from the so-called Venus Tablet of Ammisaduqa than any of the other pos-
 sible chronologies consistent with the Venus data, and that this agreement was better than would be
 expected from the best of a random set of wrong chronologies. Furthermore, both sets of data strongly
 and independently exclude the accepted "middle chronology", which was initially adopted without empir-
 ical support simply as a diplomatic compromise between the "long" and "short" chronologies champi-
 oned by Goetze and Kammenhuber. Pottery evidence is thought to support a later chronology, which
 however requires rejecting the Venus data as relevant evidence. Huber (2000) has shown that all astro-
 nomical evidence - Venus data, month-length data, eclipse reports, and omens - support a single consis-
 tent chronology for the dynasties of Akkad, Ur III, and Babylon 1 with the following key dates (BCE):
 1 Naram-sin = 2301; 1 Amar-sin = 2094; 1 Ammisaduqa = 1702. The principal evidence against this chro-
 nology is a single "floating" tree-ring analysis of a Turkish burial chamber, acknowledged to be inconsistent
 with a later tree ring analysis (Manning et al. 2001).

 10 We use the expression "Diagonal Rule" (rather than the anachronistic "Pythagorean Theorem") to des-
 ignate the relation between length, width and diagonal of a rectangle, as well as the proof of this relation,
 as attested for example in the tablets Db 2 146 and MS 3971 #2 (see below).

 449-451) to Goetze's Group 3 from Uruk (Neugebauer and Sachs 1945, p. 146),
 utilize the rule, undercutting this argument. Since Banks may have actually known the

 provenance of the text, we give his testimony particular weight. See Part II for more
 details.

 The tablet's mathematical character was recognized by Neugebauer, who with Sachs

 (1945) under the heading "Pythagorean Numbers" and showed that the text concerns

 numbers which satisfy the relationship,

 d2 = i2+b2, (1)

 where d, t, and b are respectively the diagonal, length (long-side) and width (short-
 side) of a rectangle or right triangle. Since then, the tablet has been the object of
 extensive discussion and debate concerning its construction, interpretation and likely

 contents when complete.11

 1.2 Physical description

 The existing tablet is a large fragment, written in landscape orientation, containing
 four columns of numbers aligned by vertical scoring, cleanly broken at the vertical

 scoring on the left side of the first preserved column. Top, bottom and right edges are
 preserved. Columnar scoring continues over the bottom edge and onto the reverse,
 both of which are otherwise blank. Two lines of column headings at the top of obverse

 are followed by 15 rows of numbers, uniformly aligned within horizontal scorings

 (see photo in Appendix B).

 The writing is clear and remarkably uniform (the succession of "KT's in column IV'

 are virtually indistinguishable). Column widths reflect the maximal length of the com-

 ponent numbers plus space for an additional (sexagesimal) "digit". For the most part

 vertical alignment of digits is preserved.12 Column IV' reflects a less formal numerical

 notation than the other, strictly mathematical, columns wherein "4" is depicted as 2 + 2
 (two tiers of two verticals) and "7" and "8" as 4 + 3 and 4+4, respectively,13 Thereby,

 emphasizing its different character. Generally, and despite the errors discussed below,
 the tablet reflects a high level of professional competence. It is not student work.

 The dimensions are the following. Outer: 127 mm (long) x 88 mm (high) x 32 mm

 (thick); writing surface: 125 mm x 83 mm (the rest is edge curvature). Column- widths:
 I' = 57 mm, II' = 24 mm, III' = 25 mm, IV' = 19 mm. Heading height: 13 mm; 15

 rows = 70 mm ~ '' mm/row. The rows are remarkably uniform; the largest variation
 is between row 1 (5 mm) and row 2 (4 mm); the rest are visually uniform and slightly

 less than 5 mm. The writing is similarly uniform with one sexagesimal "digit" com-

 prised of tens and units taking 7 mm or a little less pretty consistently, except where

 Extensive bibliographies may be found in Robson (200 1 , pp. 203-206) and Friberg ( 1 98 1 , pp. 3 1 7-3 1 8).

 Both omit Anagnostakis and Goldstein (1974) despite its relevance to their interpretations.

 12 Exceptions include misalignments implying empty "digits" in column I', rows 5 and 6.

 13 However is written in standard notation as 3 tiers of 3 contra Robson (2001, p. 173) but as reflected

 in her copy.

 the initial digit is "1". "KI" at the beginning of each entry in column IV' similarly
 takes 7 mm (with 1 mm extending over the scoring into the end of column III'). The

 total distance vertically scored but empty on lower edge and reverse equals ~105 mm

 (lower edge, 22 mm; reverse, 83 mm), which is equivalent to space for an additional

 22 or 23 rows of a height similar to those on the obverse.

 The maximum thickness of the fragment is slightly right of the middle of col. I',

 95 mm from right edge of the writing surface and 30 mm from the break at the left

 edge. By symmetry roughly 65 ± 5 mm of writing surface should be missing on the
 left side of the tablet,14 implying a total original length of ca., 190 mm and original
 dimensions of roughly 8^" x 3 V x 1

 Neugebauer and Sachs (1945, pp. 39) report the presence of modern glue on the

 broken left edge of the tablet prior to baking and infer that the missing part was lost

 after its excavation. Robson (2001 , p. 172) suggests that an extraneous fragment might

 have been attached to give an appearance of completeness, which Banks would have

 recognized and removed. The nature of the break, however, combined with the careful

 scoring and uniform writing would have made any such "amplification" immediately

 apparent and hardly worth the effort. More likely is that that the tablet broke, was

 repaired following excavation, and broke again at the weak repair with the resulting
 fragment(s) becoming separated prior to reaching Banks. Many tablets from Larsa
 were purchased around the same time by museums and collectors, and the missing
 fragment may well remain unrecognized among them.

 1.3 Copy and transcription

 Robson (2001, p.193, 2002a, p. 105) presents a clear copy, which depicts the text's
 contents accurately15 in both substance and spacing. A flake of destroyed surface at

 the top left results in lost or damaged signs at the beginning of both lines of the heading

 of column I' and obscures the initial two or three digits of the numbers in rows 1 to 4
 of column I'.

 A transcription of the tablet roughly consistent in spacing and alignment with the

 tablet (see the photo in Appendix B and Robson's copy) is presented in Table 1, where
 the heading of column I' also follows Robson (2001 , p. 191) restoration. Friberg (2007,

 p. 441) proposes to insert "a-sa" to the left of ta-k]i-il-ti in line 1 of column I'. However,

 there is clearly not room for this within the boundaries of column I', nor any reason

 for the heading to extend into the preceding column, since ample room remains to the

 right to accommodate it. There has been a persistent debate whether column I' begins

 14 de Solla Price (1964, p. 1) estimates the missing fragment as "somewhat more than half as wide as that
 preserved", thus ca., 65-75 mm. Robson (2001, p. 193) estimates that no more than 50 mm is missing, but
 from the shape and thickness of the existing fragment, this is clearly too little. From the nature of the break
 Friberg (1981, p. 283) suggests that "as much as perhaps a third of the whole tablet is missing", which is
 consistent with the above estimate from curvature alone. Recently, however, he increased his estimate of the

 missing tablet, first to "a third or more" (Friberg 2007, p. 434), then (p. 441 ) to "nearly half' (ca., 100 mm),

 which is clearly inconsistent with the existing curvature and much less likely than his earlier estimate.

 15 A trivial exception depicts "7" = 4 + 3 in column IV' as "6" = 3 + 3. Muroi (2003, n.4) suggests there
 may be other errors, but gives no details, and we have found none.

 with "1", which is mysterious, since remnants of the top of the vertical wedge, "1",

 are visible on the tablet in lines 7 through 1 1 and more clearly so in lines 14 through

 17, as reflected in Robson's copy and as we observed in the original.

 In Table 1 , numbers readable in any part are shown in bold; errors are italicized

 and underlined. Shaded sections approximately reflect surface damage where text is

 unreadable or missing. Digit spacing is as in the text, especially lines 1, 7, 8, and 13.

 1 .4 Errors

 There are six well-known errors.16 Two appear to be copy errors (presumably from a
 work tablet), to wit:

 row 2, col. V 56 = copy error for 50, 6
 row 9, col. II' 9 = copy error for 8

 The other four errors have implications for interpretation and the manner of calcu-

 lation. They are:

 16 In line 7, a blank space appears in the tablet between 54 and 1, but there is no zero there; idem in line
 8 between 47 and 6. In row 13, col. I' 1;27, 0, 3,45 is correct and consistent with Robson's copy, contra
 Robson (2001, p. 175, Table 2) who reads 1 ;27, 3,45 with Neugebauer and Sachs (1945), but corrected in
 Neugebauer ( 1 95 1 , p. 37).

 Plimpton 322 525

 row 2, col.III' 3,12 , 1 , = copy error for 3,13; it should be 1,20,25
 row 8, col V 59 = an error for 45,14 resulting from a medial zero copy

 error in its calculation, but with implications for the

 manner of calculation (cf. Anagnostakis and Goldstein,
 1974).

 row 13, col. II' 7,72, 1 is the square of expected 2,41 or, alternatively, a

 row 15, col. II' 56 is twice expected 28, or 53 is half 1,46.

 copy error for 7,13.

 1.5 Contents

 1.5. J Columns

 I' . The numerical contents of column I' consist of progressively diminishing numbers,

 S2 = l+^[=(d/i)2] (2)

 where S and have terminating sexagesimal digits. As noted by de Solla Price (1964,

 p. 223) these numbers express the Diagonal Rule relationships among the dimensions
 of a series of progressively flatter rectangles or right triangles with unit length=l,
 width (short side) = fi <1, and diagonal, S = ^/(l + fi2).]7 They can be scaled up to
 give the dimensions of any specific rectangle of proportionate size by multiplying 8

 and f$ "with" (as Babylonian terminology would put it) the actual (or desired) length,

 i, so that for a given t,

 b = p-lmdd = 8'l (3)

 Column I' is thus an explicit statement of the Diagonal Rule applied to rectangles with

 unit length and progressively smaller short sides, starting with a rectangle very nearly
 square ({$ = b/i = 0; 59, 30).

 The heading of this column has long been uncertain with respect to both its read-
 ing and interpretation. However, Robson (2001, 191),18 has proposed inserting a "1"
 between the requisite sa and the missing in- at the beginning of line 2, and shown that

 what can be read of the fragmentary signs of the last word can only be consistent with

 i-il-lu-u .19 With this restoration the heading becomes intelligible as

 17 Neugebauer and Sachs (1945, p. 39) describe the contents as progressively diminishing ratios, (d/£)2,
 which is mathematically equivalent but misses both the sense of a series of normalized rectangles with unit
 length and the implicit expression of the Diagonal Rule (2) by the number, its integer, and its fractional

 part.

 19 Following Goetze as reported by de Solla Price (1964, p. 226).

 takilti siliptim sa 1 innassahuma sag illu

 the takiltum of the diagonal (from) which 1 is torn out (i.e., subtracted) and (that of)

 the width comes up.

 We discuss takiltum in more detail subsequently. For now it suffices to note that if it

 is translated simply as "square", following Thureau-Dangin,20 the heading accurately
 describes the contents of the column.

 1.5.2 Columns If and Ilf

 Excepting errors, these columns give the integer dimensions of the width (sag)
 and diagonal {siliptim) of the rectangles whose relative proportions are implicit in
 column V . Each descriptive heading (sag or siliptim) is preceded by the qualifying
 term lb-sis, a term frequently encountered in quadratic problem texts denoting the
 linear dimension or "equalside" of the completed square.21 Thus the term may sim-

 ply be a qualifier indicating that a linear dimension or line segment is meant, but it
 may also imply some purposeful connection with the associated square defined by
 this dimension. Translations as "equalside width" (II') and "equalside diagonal" (III')

 convey both possibilities. If the term only emphasizes that line segments are described,
 then "short-side" and "diagonal-side" would serve as well. Neugebauer's and Sachs's

 suggested interpretation of lb-sis as "solving-number" (Neugebauer and Sachs 1945,

 p. 39), seems not only removed from the semantic range of the term, but unhelpfully
 opaque as well. H0yrup (2002, 25ff.) discusses the relevant issues at length.

 1.5.3 Column IVf

 The last column successively numbers the rows as ki n meaning No. n (or nth), begin-

 ning with n = 1 in line 1. The heading, mu-bi-im, often translated as "its name", more

 accurately here means "its line" or even more simply, "line" or "item".

 Robson (2001, p. 173), following Friberg,22 remarks that the numbers in this col-
 umn are written differently than in the preceding columns with "4" written as two
 tiers of two wedges and "7", "8" and "9" written as two tiers of 4+3, 4+4 and 5+4
 vertical wedges, in contrast to the conventional three-tier notation in the preceding col-
 umns.23 This suggests that OB notation distinguished between "mathematical" and
 more casual "descriptive" numbers, a distinction which disappears in Late Babylonian
 and Seleucid texts.

 20 Thureau-Dangin (1938, p. 226).

 21 Attinger (2008) asserts persuasively that the conventional transcription, fb-sig, retained here for its
 familiarity, should instead be fb-sa. See also H0yrup (2002, p. 27, n45).

 22 Friberg (1981, p. 295), not cited by Robson.

 23 However, contra Robson (2001 , p. 1 73), "9" is written in the normal 3-tier notation as shown in her copy
 (2001, p. 171).

 Fig. 1 Quadratic solution

 1.5.4 Takiltum

 The term takiltum is a nominative form of the verb sutakulum (to make hold fast

 together), the causal/reciprocal (St) stem of the verb kullum (to hold fast),24 which

 is used for multiplication in the context of rectangularization (H0yrup 2002, p. 23).

 H0yrup (2002) translates it as "the made hold". Muroi (2003) has collected 12 attested

 instances of takiltum , one of which is Plimpton 322. Nine of the others refer to the side

 of the auxiliary square which is added to a previously computed area to "complete the

 square", whose side - increased or decreased by the takiltum - is the solution to the
 problem.

 Most of the instances occur in the context of solving a quadratic equation effec-

 tively reduced25 to the form x2 ±bx = c, for which (in modern notation) the solution
 proceeds as x = y/[c + (b/2)2} ± b/ 2, in the following steps (Fig. 1):

 (1) given x2 ±bx = c, compute b/2
 (2) multiply b/2 by itself to give (b/2)2
 (3) add (b/2)2 to c, [completing (x + b/2)2]
 (4) obtain the square root of [c + {b/2)2} 26
 (5) subtract (or add) b/2, "your takiltum " [to find your answer].

 In each case "takiltum" appears only in step (5) where it refers to the quantity b/2
 multiplied by itself in step (2) to make an auxiliary square, whose area completes the
 square with side x ± b/2. In these cases, therefore, takiltum refers strictly to the side

 24 A debate persists as whether Sutakulum is a form of akalum (to eat) or kullum (to hold fast), alternatives
 which are indistinguishable in cuneiform writing. Thureau-Dangin, H0yrup and Robson have interpreted
 the verb as a form of kullum meaning "to make hold fast together". Neugebauer and Sachs, Muroi, and
 Friberg have interpreted it as a form of akalum meaning "to make eat one another". H0yrup (2002, p. 23),
 summarizes the arguments pro- and con- and argues - compellingly in our opinion - for the more sensible

 "make hold" interpretation. Everyone agrees that takiltum can only derive from kullum.

 25 In the more general case of ay2 ± by = c, the first step is to multiply by a, making the expression
 quadratic in ay = jc, finding y in the last step as y = x • 1 /a.

 of the completing square, which is removed (subtracted or added) in the last step from

 the side of the completed square, x ± b/2, to give x. Moreover, in no case is the area

 of the completed square, c + (b/2)2 in steps (3, 4), described as other than a number.

 An instructive variation on this procedure occurs in VAT 85 1 2.27 Here, the prob-

 lem concerns a triangular field (Fig. 2) divided into two unequal parts by a transverse

 barrier ( pirkum = jc); one of the parts (A) has 7,0 units more area than the other (B)

 whose baseline, however, is 20 units longer than A's. The problem set is to find: the

 length of the barrier (jc); the areas A and B, and the lengths of the respective baselines,

 y and y + 20. However, takiltum appears only in the course of first finding jc, the

 length of the barrier, whose solution proceeds as follows.

 (1) a rectangle is constructed on the 20-unit excess of the base-line of B whose area

 equals the 7,0 units by which the area of A exceeds that of B, making its other

 dimension equal to 21 units.

 (2) this rectangle is extended by the length of the base-line (i.e., to length 2 y + 20),

 forming a trapezoid with the subject triangle, which the barrier - extended to the

 edge of the trapezoid (i.e., by the 21 units of height of the added base) - will bisect
 into equal areas.

 (3) the square of length of the extended barrier is then found by the formula for

 bisecting trapezoids as the average of the squares of the parallel sides (si and S2),

 Here, we have a different formula applied, but again the construction of an

 auxiliary square with side S2 = 21, which is not part of the subject figure, whose
 area is combined with that of the square on s' to give a quantity equal to twice the
 square on x + S2. Halving this and finding the square-root as before yields x + 52,
 from which S2 , parenthetically called the takiltum , is subtracted to obtain x. Four lines
 later the same dimension is subtracted from 51 28 to restore s' = 30. However, here
 instead of takiltum it is described as

 Apart from offering further evidence, should any be needed, that sutakalum derives

 from kullum , not akalum , the distinct descriptions, suggest that takiltum implies an
 element that is a key step in the process of solution, and not simply a particular
 dimension.

 In each instance where its meaning is clear takiltum refers to the side of an auxil-
 iary square, which plays a key role in solving a quadratic equation. Two exceptions
 occur. In TMS 19 after referring to b/2 as described above, takiltum appears again

 referring to b , most probably as simply a scribal error. The other appears in VAT 8389
 (Neugebauer 1935-1937, pp. 317-319), in a problem concerning the rents and yields
 of two fields. Here no square is formed, and the damaged term as restored by Neu-
 gebauer and Thureau-Dangin refers to two previously calculated results of division,
 effectively "yields" which are subsequently added together. Neugebauer took the term

 to mean something like "factor" or "coefficient", and this divergent meaning persuaded

 him to leave takiltum un-translated elsewhere. H0yrup (2002, p. 80, nl06) suggests
 restoring takirtum "change" for the two damaged occurrences (ta-ki-i[rn- -tarn] and

 [ ta-ki-ir^ytam ), which arguably better fits the context of the problem. Whatever the

 explanation, the context is clearly anomalous and inconsistent with all of the other
 attestations.

 In the foregoing examples, takiltum refers to the side of the auxiliary square but is

 immediately preceded by the operation of finding the side of the completed square,

 introduced by the term lb-sis indicating that linear quantities are now involved rather

 than areas. It seems plausible, therefore, that takiltum connotes both the auxiliary
 square and its defining side, in the same way as mithartum describes both "side" and
 "square configuration" in BM 15285 (H0yrup 2002, pp. 60-6 1).29 In this sense ta-

 kiltum seems to have denoted an abstract square quantity, conceptually separate from

 the geometrical elements comprising the problem, introduced as a transitory element
 to enable a solution, which is removed as the solution is achieved. A translation as

 "number square" to connote a purely numerical quantity distinct from the geometric

 components of the problem, or, even more simply "square", as tentatively proposed,

 would seem to capture this sense of the term, while remaining consistent with H0yrup's

 more literal translation as "(the) made hold". Thus a more precise translation of the

 heading of column I' might be

 The number square of the diagonal (from) which
 1 is subtracted and (that of) the width comes up.

 This interpretation encompasses the "square" element of previous interpretations

 proposed by de Solla Price (1964, p. 7), Robson (2001 , p. 193), and even Friberg (2007,

 p. 440), although without requiring the unlikely addition of "a-sa" as Friberg proposes.

 It goes beyond these, however, in emphasizing an abstract numerical construct such as

 we find in connection with auxiliary squares used in the solution of quadratics, which

 is the sole context for which it is unambiguously attested. Muroi (2003, p. 262) leans

 in this direction and understands the term to apply to the process of completing the

 square, but attributes the term effectively to the whole quantity {ax +&/2)2, in conflict
 with its consistent use in the examples he collects.

 As an aside, the geographical distribution of texts containing takiltum parallels that

 of those employing the Diagonal Rule. Thus of the nine texts with consistent takiltum

 references two are from the south,30 while seven are from the periphery.31 By compar-

 ison, Friberg's recent (2007, p. 450) list of texts employing the Diagonal Rule includes

 four from the south32 and twelve from the periphery.33 Thus the term, which appears

 to lack a Sumerian equivalent, may have originated in the periphery and diffused to

 the center, perhaps in the company of the Diagonal Rule.

 declines more or less steadily at the rate of roughly 0;1 per row. Pythagorean num-

 bers - i.e., triples of integers satisfying the Diagonal Rule (1) - were thought to have

 then been formed with these values of r and s by the number-theoretical formula

 1 .6 Numerical analysis

 (1) Where do the numbers come from and what principle governed their selection

 and organization?

 (2) How were the numbers computed and what does this imply about the author's

 approach to the exercise and understanding of the relationships involved?

 Where do the numbers come from? Neugebauer and Sachs (1945, pp. 38-41) con-
 cluded that the tablet was constructed by first selecting regular numbers r and s (in

 Friberg's notation) so that

 d/i = '/2(r/s+s/r) (4a)

 d = r2 + s2,b = r2 -s2,l = 2 rs. (4b)

 This conclusion was emphasized in Neugebauer's Exact Sciences in Antiquity 34
 and became regarded as the number- theoretical essence of the authors' understand-
 ing of the text, eclipsing the earlier conclusion35 that the numbers in the text arose

 from the selection of pairs of regular numbers, r and s , whose ratios , combined as in

 (4), resulted in desired values of d/i meeting the essentially subjective criterion of a

 steady rate of decrease. No constraint was suggested for r and s beyond the suggestion

 that they were taken from combined multiplication tables, which of course included

 standard tables of reciprocals.

 Subsequent commentators, notably Bruins (1949, 1955, 1957), Schmidt (1980),
 Voils (per Buck, 1980) and most recently Robson (2001), argued that the more likely

 starting point for the construction of the text was the ratios, r/s, and their reciprocals,

 rather than their components, a possibility acknowledged but rejected by Neugebauer
 and Sachs, who believed that "only the simple numbers r and s" could have been the

 "point of departure". In the alternative view, the starting point for the construction of the

 text consisted of pairs of reciprocals extracted from lists of extended reciprocals sub-
 ject to some limitation on the number of places (i.e., sexagesimal "digits") comprising
 either or both. Robson (2001) champions this interpretation but also acknowledges its
 shortcomings, namely that among OB mathematical texts no such tables of extended

 reciprocals are known, and further that if r/s is restricted to 4 places and s/r to 3

 (a more severe limitation than exhibited in the text), then missing from the text are

 entries corresponding to three such reciprocal pairs, namely:36

 all of which result in values of ( d/t )2 with fewer "digits" than that in row 10 of the
 text.37

 These critiques (other than Bruins' which came earlier) ignore the more plausible

 answer proposed by de Solla Price (1964) and affirmed by Friberg (1981), namely that

 the contents of the text arise naturally from the set of all distinct ratios of regular inte-
 gers, r/s, where 1 < r/s < ^2+1 = 2; 24,51, 10 = 2; 25 and s is a regular sexagesi-
 mal "digit" (i.e., 1 < s < 1, 0).38 The right side of the first condition is a consequence
 of considering only rectangles (or corresponding right triangles) where b < i and
 therefore b/i = 1/2 {r/s- s/r) < 1. Since d/t = 1 /2(r/s+s/r) < ^/2, (< d+b)/l =
 r/s < *J2 + 1 = 2; 25, and the left side follows from 0 < b/i = 1/2 (r/s - s/r )
 which implies 1 < r/s.

 There turn out to be just 38 reduced combinations of r and s which satisfy the above

 conditions, whose first 15 ratios, arranged in descending order, lead to precisely the

 examples found in the text. All of which was understood and explained in detail by
 de Solla Price, who observed, contra Neugebauer and Sachs, that "...it follows that

 the regularity of decrease of [r/s] or in column [I'] is simply the result of considerable

 uniformity in the density of such regular numbers among the integers, (de Solla Price
 1964, p. 3)

 de Solla Price made another significant observation, namely that the tablet, scored

 as it is over the lower edge of the obverse and on the reverse, appears unfinished and

 that the space remaining is just sufficient to accommodate entries corresponding to the

 remaining 23 ratios of r and s 39 See the photo of the reverse in Appendix B. Careful

 measurement supports this estimate, and the close fit40 implies that the dimensioning

 of the tablet was done with this objective in mind. Thus to the question: where do the

 numbers come from and what principal governed their selection, the answer seems
 unambiguous. The tablet represents the unfinished result of an investigation of all
 ratios, r/s, of regular numbers, where 1 < r/s < 2; 25 and 1 < s < 1, 0, arranged in
 descending order of r/s.

 Table 2 shows the values of r for each value of s, which lead to unique reduced

 ratios with 1 < r/s < 2; 25. Table 3 shows the resulting values of r/s arranged in

 descending order. In a sense, the "point of departure" for the construction of the text

 was indeed the simple regular numbers r and s , as suggested by Neugebauer and Sachs,

 but with s limited to sexagesimal digits, and r constrained only by the condition that

 37 Joyce (1995) follows a similar line of argument, but caps p at 2, 5, reducing the number of missing
 entries to one (11a).

 38 de Solla Price (1964, p. 221) observes that the restriction of s to sexagesimal "digits" is demonstrated
 by the omission of entries for r/s = 125/64 (2,5/1,4) and 135/64 (2,15/1,4) which "would have occurred
 between lines 8 and 9 and 1 1 and 1 2, respectively".

 39 Friberg (1981, 2007) embraces de Solla Price's conjecture; Robson (2001, 2002a, 2002b) ignores it.

 40 The likely arrangement would seem to be: 4 rows on the lower edge; 17 rows on the reverse; and 2 rows
 curving over on to the back side of the top edge.

 r/s be greater than 1 and less than y/2 + 1 . At issue remains whether r and s continued

 to play any further role in the construction of the text, as Neugebauer and Sachs inter

 alia affirmed, or whether their role was limited to defining the set of reciprocal ratios
 which comprised its basic raw material. For the answer, we need to look at the likely
 manner of its computation.

 How were the numerical entries computed? Two distinct approaches have domi-
 nated the discussion of this question. Neugebauer and Sachs (1945) - and especially
 Neugebauer (1951) - followed by Gillings (1953), Aaboe (1964), and de Solla Price
 ( 1 964), assumed use of the number-theoretical generating function (4b above) whereby

 and thus i = 2 rs.

 An alternate procedure was proposed by Bruins, initially in two papers (Bruins
 1949, 1955), whose shortcomings41 included gross mistakes, limited accessibility, and

 an undisguised animosity towards Neugebauer that impeded serious consideration of
 his views. He may have realized this, for a subsequent paper in The Mathematical

 Gazette (Bruins, 1957)42 presents a succinct analysis of the text in a straightforward,

 comprehensible style, unencumbered by hyperbole or hints of personal animus. While

 certain of his proposals are incorrect,43 his principal contribution was to emphasize

 the reciprocal formulation of the problem, whereby

 S2 (I') = {1/2 (r/s + s/r))2 = 1/4 |(r/s)2 + (5/r)2} + 1/2, (5b)

 £2 (I') = {1/2 (r/s - s/r)}2 = 82 (i') - 1,

 b (llr) = (r/s - s/r) • rs = 2/3 • rs , and

 d (ill') = ( r/s + s/r) - rs = 28 - rs ,

 and to have proposed explanations for each of the errors encountered, which were

 arguably more "natural" than those advanced by advocates of the number-theoretical
 formulation.

 Apart from utilizing the reciprocal formulation (5b), a central feature of Bruins'
 approach was a method for computing b and d , which skirted direct multiplication

 by rs implied by (5b) above. Instead, Bruins proposed that this was accomplished by
 removing common regular factors from and 8 by repeated multiplications by the

 reciprocals of regular factors in the last "digit" of the resulting number, and continuing

 this procedure until no regular factors remained in the last digit of at least one of the

 pair. Friberg (2007, p. 24) calls this the "trailing part algorithm", and it is essentially
 a variant of the "Technique" described by Sachs (1947)44 for finding the reciprocal of

 any regular number. Done correctly (i.e., by the same factors for b and d) it yields the
 same result as 1/2 (r/s ± s/r) • 2 rs.

 Bruins' approach was reiterated with some variation of detail (and considerable
 variation in clarity) by Schmidt (1980), Voils 45 Buck (1980), Friberg (1981, 2007)
 and Robson (2001, 2002a), none of whom mentioned his unique explanation of the

 41 Described in Robson (2001, p. 185).

 42 Curiously mentioned by neither Friberg (1981) nor Robson (2001).

 43 Notably his belief that column I' contained only / 3 2 and lacked a left-most "1", and his claim that the
 text reflected all ratios of regular numbers between 2;24 and 1;48 inclusive, as noted by Robson (2001, pp.
 185-186).

 error in row 13 (see below). Its application to Plimpton 322 is shown in Table 4. Row
 11 is once again exceptional, since there we should find b = 3, d = 5, were the

 procedure strictly applied. However, as noted, the canonical form of this relationship

 is 45:1,0:1,15, so this discrepancy is without significance. Apart from avoiding mul-
 tiplication by numbers outside the standard multiplication tables (e.g., 57 in row 2)
 and by 2-digit numbers (e.g., 57,36 and 1,48 in rows 2 and 10), it is hard to see much

 benefit from this procedure over direct multiplication by rs. However, as we shall see

 from the analysis of errors, it does appear to have been the procedure followed.

 We can appraise the relative likelihood of the two techniques by examining how

 each might have led to the four non-trivial errors in the text.

 I'(8): 1,41,33,59,3,45 instead of 1,41,33,45,74,3,45. Robson glosses over this error,

 characterizing it46 as a "simple arithmetical error: two places added together" and

 lumping it with the copy errors as an artifact without computational consequence of
 transferring calculations from the work-tablet or copy board to finished tablet. How-
 ever, as Anagnostakis and Goldstein (1974) showed in a note overlooked by both
 Friberg and Robson,47 the error results naturally from ignoring a medial zero in the

 course of calculating this entry. Specifically, they showed that if I'(8) was calculated as

 S2 = {1/2 (r/s + s/r)}2 = 1/4 {(r/s)2 + ( s/r )2 + 2 r/s • s/r }

 but if the medial zero in (s/r2) is ignored in either step (ii) or step (iii) of the calculation,

 Bruins (1957, p. 27), who believed column V to comprise only /$2, proposes a

 similar explanation from calculating fi2 alone, to wit:

 P2 = 0; 49, 56, 152 = (0; 50 - 0; 0, 3, 45)2 (i)
 = 0; 41, 40 + 0; 0, 0, 0,14,3,45-0; 0, 6, 15) (ii)
 = 0;41,33,45,14,3,45, (iii)

 but, if the second term is telescoped by a sexagesimal place to 0;0, 0,14,3,45, the
 result is

 p2 =0; 41, 40 + 0; 0,0,14,3,45-0; 0,6, 15 (ii)

 = 0;41,33,59,3,45 (iii)

 seemingly more prone to similar errors than the computational procedure described

 by Anagnostakis and Goldstein, Bruins' conjecture is supported by the error in II'
 (13), discussed below, where b2 appears in place of b.

 While at first glance this appears to compel a computational path based on recip-

 rocals, an opportunity to make a similar error arises from Neugebauer's and Sachs's

 procedure (5a). Properly computed this entails the following steps

 S2 = (r2 + S2)2 / (4r2s2)

 = (322 + 152)2 • (0; 15) • (0; 1, 52, 30)2 • (0; 4)2 (i)
 = (20, 49)2 • (0; 15) • (0; 0, 3, 30, 56, 15) • (0; 0, 16) (ii)
 = (7, 13, 20, 1) • (0; 0, 3, 30, 56, 15) • (0; 0, 4) (iii)
 = 1;41,33,45,14,3,45. (iv)

 However if 7,13,20, 1 is mistaken as 7,13,21 (as in I' (2)), the result is also

 8 2 = (7, 13, 21) • (0; 0, 3, 30, 56, 15) • (0; 0, 4) (iii)

 = 1; 41, 33, 59,3,45 (iv)

 Thus, there are several paths, all entailing misplaced or telescoped sexagesimal

 digits, which can have led to the error in I'(8). Whichever the path, however, the error

 clearly arises in the course of computation, and is not simply an artifact of some copy-

 ing process. Since it did not affect the correct calculation of b or d in the two subsequent

 columns, it shows that columns IIr and III' were not computed from column If .

 We are left with three errors in columns II'(b) and III'(d),

 III'(2): d = 3, 12, 1 instead of 1,20,25
 II'(13): b = 7, 12, 1 instead of 2,41
 II, III/(15): b = 56, instead of 28, or d = 53 instead of 1,46

 and two computational paths to choose from:

 b = r2 - s 2, d = r2 + s2, (6a)

 and

 b = 1/2 (r/s - s/r ) - kb, d = 1/2 ( r/s + s/r) • kd . (6b)

 III'(2):d = 3,12,1 (or 3,13) for 1,20,25. This has been widely recognized to have
 resulted from two separate errors, one of which Bruins proposed48 was simply a copy

 error of 13 as 12,1. By (6a),

 d = 1, 42 + 272 = 212 + 36 = 1, 8, 16 + 12, 9 = 1, 20, 25,

 which is so straightforward it is difficult to see a plausible path to either result. Nor

 have the proponents of this approach been able to propose one.

 538 J. P. Britton et al.

 By (6b) the procedure is shown in Table 4, row 2. For b, three successive elimina-

 tions of the factor 5 (i.e., multiplications by 12) lead to the non-regular result 56, 7,

 and the factoring of d should have stopped there. However, it appears that the factoring

 of d continued without regard to b , until it reached the non-regular number 3,13 after

 two more steps. Thus by this approach, the error is a combination of copy error from

 13 to 12,1 plus an uncoordinated application of the trailing part algorithm, both of

 which seem perfectly plausible.

 11(13) :b = 7, 12, 1 (or 7,13), instead of 2,41. Neugebauer and Sachs note (1945,

 p. 38, nl07) that the number is the square of the correct number, and virtually all

 subsequent commentators have considered it such, without offering a compelling ratio-

 nale for why it should be.49 Exceptionally, Bruins (1957, p. 27) proposed that rather

 than the square of 2,41, the number is a copy error for 7,13 similar to that apparently
 affecting III/(2), and that instead of (r/s - s/r) = 1,20,30, the author miscopied
 (r/s + s/r) as 2,24,20 leading to multiplication by 3 instead of 2 in the trailing part

 algorithm, and thus to 7,13. This, however, effectively assumes three errors, at least

 one too many to be plausible. A simpler explanation, favoring the reciprocal algorithm,

 is that column I' was computed as f$2 + 1, and that ft1 was mistakenly used to obtain

 b by the trailing part algorithm.

 II', III'(15) :b = 56 for 28 or d = 53 for 1,46. The alternatives are:

 b = r2 - s2 = 1, 21 - 25 = 56, d = r2 + s2 = 1, 21 + 25 = 1, 46, (7a)

 and

 b = l/2(r/s - s/r) • 2 rs, d = 1/2 (r/s + s/r) • 2 rs (7b)

 The presence of the factor 2 in (7b) makes the error more easily explained as arising

 from multiplying 1/2 (r/s +s/r) by rs instead of 2 rs, than from (7a), where the factor 2

 does not appear. More plausibly, applying the trailing part algorithm, but in computing

 b either stopping a step short or removing only the factor 2 in the last step, instead of

 4 as in computing d , leads to the numbers we find, and suggests that the error was in
 II' (15), which should have been 28 instead of 56.50 Details are in Table 4 for row 15.

 In sum, the number- theoretical algorithm (7a) offers a plausible explanation for the

 error in I' (8) but fails to explain any of the errors in columns II' and III'. In contrast

 the reciprocal procedure (7a), utilizing the trailing part algorithm, offers explanations

 of all four significant errors, based on one or more of the following plausible errors:

 - medial zero or place value error: [I' (8)]
 - copy or reading errors: 12, 1 for 13 [III' (2)]
 - disparate factorization or factorization steps [III' (2), II' (15)]
 - use of ft2 from computation of I' for [II' (13)]

 49 Friberg (1981) speculates from the relative paucity of errors in column I' that it was checked by comput-
 ing b2 • (1/ £2) and that b2 was simply written down by mistake in place of b. However, column I' appears
 no more accurate than II' or III', and the error in l'(8) argues against his explanation.

 50 As in Robson (2001, p. 175, Table 2).

 On balance, there is no contest; the reciprocal procedure yields plausible expla-

 nations for all but one of the text's non-trivial errors, while the number-theoretical

 algorithm fails to offer likely, let alone compelling, explanations for any of the errors

 in columns II' and III'. Thus we may confidently exclude the number- theoretical for-

 mulation (5a) as the basis for the text's computation.

 1 .7 Missing columns

 Any attempt to estimate the missing contents of the tablet is necessarily speculative.
 However, by paying close attention to the physical characteristics of the surviving
 tablet, the possibilities can be reduced. Furthermore, since it is possible, even likely,

 that at least part of the missing fragment is buried in some collection, perhaps mis-
 characterized as was Plimpton 322, it seems worthwhile to hazard a guess as to the

 possible contents, in the hope of possibly aiding its future identification.

 At the outset we noted that by symmetry from the thickest part of the tablet it

 appears that between 60 mm and 70 mm of writing surface is missing to the left,
 and that each column of complete sexagesimal "digits" (i.e., containing both tens and

 units) takes up ~7 mm or a little less horizontally. Consequently the missing section

 should have had room for 8^ to 10 columns of full sexagesimal "digits", and perhaps

 up to lO1^ if the missing width is slightly greater than our estimate.51 This limitation
 rules out the possibility that the complete tablet contained all the numbers entailed in

 its production, each of which requires space for the number of digits shown below.52

 (Here digits lacking 10s are treated as requiring ' digit; those lacking units are treated

 as whole digits, consistent with preserved text.)

 A glance at Table 5 shows that the missing fragment could have contained either

 and 8 or r/s and s/r, but not both pairs, contra Friberg's most recent (2007) proposal.

 The latter pair could have been accompanied by either r and 5 or by 2 rs for a total

 of 10 digits taking up 70 mm of width, but combining and 8 with either r and s or

 2 rs, would add up to 1 1 digits requiring 77 mm, exceeding the likely maximal extent

 of the missing fragment. In the other direction including only the pair of reciprocal

 ratios as proposed by Robson (2001) would seem to take up too little space. Thus the

 likely alternatives appear to be either the pair /3 and 8, or r/s and s/r plus either r and
 s or 2 rs.

 Of these, it seems far more likely that the missing fragment contained and 8

 on several grounds. First, the likely method of computation of columns II' and III'
 requires both and appears to have been unaffected by errors in column I'. Further-
 more, since at least part of the tablet concerns the dimensions of rectangles of unit
 length, as reflected in column I', beginning the tablet with would have amounted to

 a statement of the relative flatness of the rectangles in each line. Finally, the inclusion

 5 1 de Solla Price, who had a good eye for such things, estimated "more than a third" of the tablet to be
 missing. This would seem consistent with slightly more than my estimate, perhaps 70-75 mm, which would

 allow room for 10 or 101/2 digits but probably not 1 1 .

 52 In the existing text, the initial "1" in column V evidently takes up less than a full digit's space, while all
 three columns leave room for units following a last digit which contains only tens.

 length.

 The alternative - including the reciprocal ratios plus either their component digits

 or 2 rs - suffers in comparison, first by omitting and 8 , needed for the computation
 of columns If and III' but also because the ratios are at least a step removed from

 the remaining contents of the tablet. Furthermore, while one might expect columns
 II' and III' to have been accompanied by the corresponding lengths equal to 2 rs, the

 natural place for this to have appeared would have been between columns I' and II'.
 Placing 2 rs before column I' would have made no logical sense, and making it the
 first column would have introduced the appearance of random order conflicting with

 both convention and the text's natural order. Finally, since neither r nor s seem to play

 any direct role in the remainder of the tablet, there seems no motivation for including
 them.

 On balance, we think it can be assumed with fair confidence that the missing frag-

 ment contained p and 8 as suggested in Friberg (1981), probably unaccompanied by

 5, r, or 2 rs as displayed in Table 6.

 1.8 Purpose

 Friberg and Robson both regard Plimpton 322 as a pedagogical "teacher's aid" intended
 to serve as a source of parameters and checkable intermediate results for sets of "solv-

 able" problems - "solvable" meaning solutions comprised of numbers with finite sex-
 agesimal expressions, called "semi-regular" by Friberg. Less clear is exactly what
 sorts of problems were the object of the exercise. Robson (2001, p. 201) summarizes
 the dilemma succinctly as follows:

 . . .But we are still left with a decision to make: was this teachers' list a compen-

 dium of suitable sets of right triangles (Friberg) or reciprocal pairs (Voils/Buck)?

 If we go with Friberg, we have to explain why Column I is in the table and why
 there is no (extant) column for /. If on the other hand we follow Voils/Buck, the

 problem is to explain why Columns II and III contain values which have been
 scaled up by the factor / - and why the word "diagonal" crops up in the heading
 of Columns I and III.

 Robson notes that neither Friberg (1981) nor Buck (1980) satisfactorily resolves

 the issue and takes a contextual run at it before conceding that the manner in which

 the text was computed (i.e., by reciprocal sums and differences) does not necessarily
 reflect the problems it was designed to set, which, she concludes, edging towards
 Friberg (1981), must be "some sort of right triangle problems" (Robson 2001, p. 202).

 Meanwhile, Friberg, who concluded in (1981, p. 300)

 that it may have been the intention of the author of the tablet to find the front and

 diagonal of all rational right triangles with flank (i.e., length) = 1 under the sole
 condition for practical reasons that the parameter t = s/r ...must be a regular
 sexagesimal number such that, for instance, s < 1,0.

 simply noting (1981, p. 303) as a secondary matter,

 the interesting possibility of a close connections between the "Babylonian trian-

 gle parameter equations" and the treatment of some types of quadratic equations

 tacks back in (2007, p. 433), and describes the text in the title of Appendix 8 as "Plimp-

 ton 322: a Table of Parameters for igi-igi.bi Problems." Here he is clearly influenced
 by the discovery of two previously unknown texts, MS 3971 and MS 3052, which

 contain six similar problems: given igi = r/s and thus implicitly igibi = s/r, find the
 short side /3 as ^/{l /2(r/s + s/r)2 - 1}. As Friberg notes, solutions to the 5 prob-
 lems in MS 3971 comprise lines 18, 22, 29, 32, and 37 in the completed extension of

 Plimpton 322 shown in Table 6, while MS 3052 concerns the simplest of ratios: r/s =

 igi = 2, igibi- 0;30, p = 0;45, corresponding to line # 1 1 in the actual text.

 Significantly, all six of these problems assume a normalized rectangle with unit

 length, X = 1, and all employ a round-about solution path starting with r/s = a and
 computing l/a,8 = 1/2 (a + '/a),82,p2 = 82 - 1, and finally = ^/{ 8 2 - 1},
 largely reversing the construction of column V in Plimpton 322 and eschewing the
 shortcut of = 1/2 (a - 1 /a) implicit in the underlying algorithm. Since the pro-
 cedure works for any regular a < 2; 25, it is hard to see what Plimpton 322 would
 contribute, apart from the (strangely indirect) intermediate calculations and answers.

 Finally, as Robson notes, what is to be made of columns II' and III' in the absence of

 their widely varying third dimension, l=2rsl

 Thus, despite their sometimes spirited differences Friberg and Robson arrive by

 different paths at a largely similar view that Plimpton 322 was intended to serve as
 a teachers' aide linking reciprocal relationships to the Diagonal Rule, without ever
 quite pinpointing what problems it would have uniquely helped construct, or what
 mathematical purpose it might have served. Otherwise they differ in emphasis and

 perspective with Robson minimizing the tablet's mathematical character in favor of

 its more prosaic pedagogical attributes, and Friberg - embracing de Solla Price's con-

 jecture that it was intended to encompass a complete set of entries - emphasizing its
 mathematical attributes.

 1.9 Summary

 - Plimpton 322 concerns sets of diagonal triples, /3, 1,3, for normalized rectangles

 of unit length computed from ratios r/s of regular numbers as

 P = 1/2 (r/s - s/r), 8 = 1/2 (r/s + s/r).

 - From the scoring on the lower edge and reverse and measurements of the unwritten
 surface area it appears the its author intended to include entries for all 38 unique
 ratios, r/s satisfying the conditions

 1 < r/s < 1 -I- *J2, and 1 < s < 1, 0.

 - It is highly likely that the missing fragment to the left contained only /3 and 8.
 - Column I' reflects the fundamental diagonal relationship, 82 = 1 4- ^2, in a single
 number for each entry, probably computed in the same fashion. The term takilti in

 its heading means "square" but with emphasis on its abstract numerical rather than

 concrete geometrical nature.

 - Columns II' and III', reflecting the integer values for width and diagonal corre-

 sponding to each /?, were computed by successive applications of the "trailing part
 algorithm" to and 8.

 - The four non-trivial errors can be explained as due to

 • medial zero or place value error: [Y (8)]
 • copy or reading error: 12, 1 for 13 [III' (2)], or
 • disparate factorization steps [III' (2), II' (15)]
 • use of f$2 from computation of I' for [II' (13)].

 - The writing, layout, and construction of the tablet reflect a high degree of skill on

 the part of its author.

 2 Part II. A Different Perspective

 Many of the difficulties encountered by Robson and to some extent Friberg in describ-

 ing the purpose of Plimpton 322, arise from their shared assumption that the tablet

 was created to serve a restricted pedagogical purpose. The following discussion aban-
 dons this assumption and considers the tablet's place as a mathematical artifact in its
 historical and mathematical context. We draw heavily upon the new material from
 the Sch0yen Collection, published with illuminating commentary by Friberg (2007),
 as well as upon the geometrical perspectives advanced by H0yrup (2002) and earlier

 papers.

 We find the tablet intimately connected with the discovery of the algorithm for
 finding triples of finite sexagesimals satisfying the Diagonal Rule, therefore closer
 to a problem text than has hitherto been proposed, and substantively "deeper" than
 a mere pedagogical aid. In the following commentary, we have avoided, as much as

 possible, using the term "triples", since there is no reference to triples in the texts under

 consideration, including P 322, but to pairs (width and diagonal). These two numbers

 define completely the rectangles which are the object of the problem, that is, rectangles

 with length, width and diagonal represented by finite sexagesimal numbers. We will
 call such rectangles "finite sexagesimal rectangles". (In the spirit of Old Babylonian

 mathematics, we refer to the associated rectangles, instead of the right triangles.)

 Our understanding of the historical and mathematical context is derived from a

 quite rich collection of cuneiform mathematical tablets dating from approximately
 the same period, that is, Old Babylonian, and coming from the same geographical
 region (according to a provisional assessment of both provenance and date). These
 texts reflect diverse scribal traditions. The Old Babylonian period covers several cen-
 turies: an early formative period (Isin-Larsa) ending with the conquest of Larsa by
 Hammurabi; an overlapping period encompassing the reigns of Hammurabi (1 848-
 1806) and Samsu-iluna (1805-1768) up to the abandonment of the southernmost cities
 (Ur, Uruk, Larsa) by 1795 and of Nippur and Isin by around 1776; and a late period
 during which scribes fled to the north after the destruction of the southern cities and

 which extended past the end of the first dynasty of Babylon (1651) into the period
 of Kassite rule. With respect to the provenance of cuneiform mathematical texts,
 there are several regions: the south - Larsa, Uruk, Ur, comprising the post-Ur III

 "core" in H0yrup's terminology, the center - Nippur, Isin; the northern region of the

 Mesopotamian plain - Kis and Sippar; the middle Euphrates, Mari and the kingdom
 of Esnunna; and finally Susa to the east. The last three are often called "peripheral".

 Common linguistic features, first analyzed by Goetze, Neugebauer and Sachs ( 1 945 ,

 pp. 146-151), and more recently and extensively by H0yrup (2002, pp. 315-361) have

 led to the recognition of several groups of texts, some of which can be correlated with
 varying degrees of certainty with distinct locations. Thus using Goetze's groupings
 as expanded by H0yrup, texts comprising groups 7 and 8 are known to come from
 Esnunna and Susa, respectively. They are also among the earliest and the latest of
 Old Babylonian mathematical texts, the former being dated to around 1840 to 1830
 and the latter thought to be late from paleographic criteria (H0yrup 2002, p. 318).
 Texts from group 6 are probably from Sippar (H0yrup 2002, p. 332). The few texts

 comprising group 5 are not specifically located but reflect both northern and southern

 characteristics and are believed to come from the periphery after the abandonment of

 at least the southernmost cities in 1795. Texts from groups 1 to 4 are all from the south,

 with group 1 attributed "in all probability" (Goetze, Neugebauer and Sachs (1945),
 p. 148) to Larsa, and groups 3 and 4 attributed to Uruk.

 Temporally, texts from Esnunna are from before ca., 1830, from Ur, Larsa and Uruk

 before 1795, those from Sippar and group 5 probably after 1795, and those from Susa

 probably later but before the end of the first dynasty of Babylon in 1651. A separate
 group of "series texts" is also thought to be late from paleographic and substantive
 considerations.

 2.1 Provenance

 Since evidence of mathematical activity at the southernmost cities disappears after

 1795, the historical context of the tablet is intimately related to its provenance. H0yrup

 (2002, p. 386) has questioned the likelihood of a Larsa provenance, noting,

 Goetze ascribes Plimpton 322 very tentatively to group 1 saying that 'it may or
 may not belong here' [Neugebauer and Sachs (1945), pp. 147, 353]. His only
 argument is the spelling [ in-]na-as-sa-hu-u-ma , which may indeed just as well

 (if not better) point to group 6.

 Similarities of vocabulary - elum (comes up) for results, nahasu for subtract, sutak-
 ulum for rectangularization and lb-sis as a nominal rather than verbal form point
 perhaps even more strongly to group 5, which H0yrup (H0yrup 2002, p. 332) finds
 closely related to the body of texts from Esnunna.

 H0yrup's other reason for doubting a Larsa provenance was the greater frequency

 of problems invoking the Diagonal Rule in texts from the periphery rather than from

 the south, suggesting that P 322 fits better with the former than the latter, as well as a

 later date than would be plausible for texts from the south. Friberg's discovery of texts

 in the Sch0yen Collection apparently from the south which involve the Diagonal Rule,
 weakens but hardly refutes this argument. A stronger case for a late date, moreover,

 can be made from the quasi absence of evidence of finite sexagesimal rectangles other
 than the classical triple 45:1:1,15, presumably known from deep antiquity.

 Plimpton 322 545

 Thus, before considering the text's mathematical context, we shall examine in

 greater detail the evidence bearing on whether it originated in the south, implying

 a pre- 1795 date, and specifically from Larsa. The chief evidence for a southern origin,

 if not specifically Larsa, is found in MS 397 1 , published in Friberg (2007, pp. 245-254

 and especially #3, pp. 252-253). It describes five problems of determining the diago-

 nals and widths of rectangles of implicitly unit length from the sums and differences
 of reciprocals. As noted by Friberg (2007, p. 444) the five problems correspond to
 line numbers 37, 18, 22, 29, and 32, from the unfinished section of P 322. Apart
 from BM 85200+ VAT 6599 #16 which also reflects the other classictriple, 5:12:13,

 corresponding to (unfinished) line 22, and seemingly known from Sargonic times, the
 examples from MS 3971 are the only Old Babylonian evidence of finite sexagesimal

 rectangles (other than the classic two) attested or implied in P 322. Significantly, they

 also imply that someone completed the unfinished exercise contemplated by P 322's
 author. Friberg places MS 3971 firmly in Goetze's group 3 from Uruk, based on an
 analysis of similarities among Sumerian elements. While this may merit confirmation

 from further analysis, it strongly suggests a temporal proximity between P 322 and
 MS 397 1 , which would rule out a late date for P 322, and makes a southern provenance

 more likely than not.

 A less compelling, but still significant, bit of evidence favoring an earlier over a

 later date is the correct, extremely precise, and very fine handwriting of the tablet's

 author (seen clearly in the photograph) which reflects none of the cursive writing found
 in later "series" or Susa texts. While not indicative of even regional origins, it does

 suggest an association of the author with the scribal traditions of a major center.

 The foregoing evidence suggests on balance that P 322 came from the south more

 probably than not, and - based on orthography and terminology - from somewhere
 other than Uruk. As noted in Part I the strongest evidence for a Larsa provenance is

 Banks's specific statement that the tablet was found at Senkereh. In an undated pro-

 spectus, probably written around 1923, describing four tablets and their prices, Banks

 described the tablet (No. 3) to Plimpton as follows

 No. 3 $ 10.00 Found at Senkereh. A very large burned tablet with one edge broken

 away, but with the inscription practically complete. It is a mathematical tablet,

 and the column at the right contains the numerals 1 to 15. The numbers in the

 columns at the left are very large, and it seems to me that they are the cubes or

 squares of the numbers in the column on the right. It was used as a mathematical
 text book (sic). The date is about 2250 B.C." (i.e., during the reign of Hammurabi
 as thought then). (Plimpton file, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia
 University)

 Tablets Nos. 1 and 2 were also described as from Senkereh, while No. 4, an Ur III

 accounting of sheep and goats, was found at Drehem. Other tablets offered to Plimp-
 ton around this time were all individually provenanced, with most from Senkereh,
 some from Ur, one from Drehem and one (P348) from Jokha (ancient Umma). Thus

 all of the tablets offered by Banks to Plimpton came from locations in the south with

 the northernmost coming from Drehem. A similar pattern of origins characterized the

 much larger volume of tablets sold by Banks to collectors and institutions across the

 continent both before and shortly after World War I, the vast majority of which came
 from the south.

 The pattern of Banks's tablet sales correlates with his travels and connections within

 Iraq. After obtaining his Ph.D. at Breslau under Delitzsch in 1897, Banks spent sev-

 eral years in Bagdad endeavoring to obtain permision to excavate first Ur, which was
 denied, and then to Bismaya (ancient Adab), which was eventually granted in 1903 to

 the University of Chicago. The university then appointed him "Field Director of the

 Babylonian section of the Oriental Exploration Fund" and an "instructor in Turkish

 and Semitic languages". While serving as field director, he made many acquaintances

 among the "dealers and manufacturers" of antiquities, as he describes them in his 1912

 account of the expedition to Bismaya. On his travels to and from Bismaya he passed

 through Hillah and Nippur, and late in 1904 he made a trip south via the Euphrates
 to visit the main southern sites of Uruk, Larsa and Ur. Of Larsa he wrote (Bismaya

 418) "Of all the ruins in Babylonia Senkera (sic) is the most promising, and this the
 illicit Arab diggers have long known." Suspected by Turkish authorities of playing
 loose with the antiquities laws, he resigned his position with the expedition at the end
 of 1904 and left Iraq. In 1912 he returned to Bagdad and purchased the remaining

 1 1,000 or so of a huge trove of illicitly excavated Ur III tablets mostly from Drehem

 and Jokha, which he sold widely to US institutions and collectors in subsequent years.

 In a 1937 letter to J.G. Phelps Stokes, to whom he had recently sold a Nebuchad-

 nezzar cylinder, Banks described his source of tablets as follows.

 Dear Mr. Stokes,

 I thank you for your fine letter and for the enclosed check in full payment for the

 Nebuchadnezzar cylinder. I can give you very little further information regard-

 ing the cylinder. I obtained it in Bagdad some years ago from a native friend
 who has supplied me with such antiquities as he can get from the natives who
 find them. These native have been trained, some of them by myself, to search

 among the ruins and to take to Bagdad whatever they find. In this way I built up

 my collections during the past forty years or more. In the earlier days under the

 Turks [i.e. pre WW I], all of the Babylonian objects which reached this country
 came in this manner, and it was about the only way to save them from the Turkish

 Museum, where they were dumped into the basement and left to perish. How-
 ever, the conditions now with an archaeological school and museum in Bagdad

 are much better. . .(Plimpton file, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia

 University)

 P 322 probably followed the same route, which would imply that the tablet passed

 through the hands of at least two other persons besides Banks - his agent in Baghdad
 and the local excavator. The latter would almost certainly be associated with a single

 location known to the agent, so the most likely source of provenance error would
 lie with the agent's record keeping. It also seems likely that it would have been the
 Baghdad agent who glued the missing fragment to the tablet, which subsequently
 re-broke.

 Banks appears to have been conscientious in passing on the information available

 to him regarding the provenance of all the tablets that he sold and open about acknowl-

 edging uncertainties of provenance where he was aware of them. His reported contacts,

 experience and travels were restricted to Baghdad and areas to its south, and there is

 no evidence that he ever visited Esnunna or the middle Euphrates north of Hillah.
 Tablets sold by him, both before and after WWI, came largely from the deep south,
 the principal exception being NB tablets from Babylon, acquired while Babylon's
 excavation by Koldewey was ongoing. Banks was certainly familiar with both the

 process and people engaged in the illegal antiquities trade and specifically with both

 the promise and vulnerability of Larsa for pillage. Banks's notoriety notwithstanding,

 there seems little reason to doubt his assertion that P 322 was found at Larsa, apart
 from the possibility that he or his agent in Baghdad mis-recorded its provenance.

 Thus while a "middle" peripheral site such as Sippar cannot be completely ruled

 out, a substantial preponderance of evidence supports the conclusion that P 322 was

 indeed found at Larsa. This suggests that the tablet was probably slightly later than

 tablets from Esnunna in the north and either slightly earlier or contemporaneous with
 tablets from Uruk such as MS 3971.

 2.2 Mathematical context

 The following discussion is based on examples from other tablets which may be rea-

 sonably considered as from the same general area and the same period. Theses related
 texts are mainly the ones published and commented by Friberg in A Remarkable
 Collection of Babylonian Mathematical Texts , Manuscripts in the Sch0yen Collec-
 tion Cuneiform Texts I (2007). We argue that P 322 presents a coherent mathematical
 project, which is to generate a series of finite sexagesimal rectangles from a basic
 algorithm, or, in other terms, that P 322 is a problem text including a complete solu-

 tion. To a large extent, this approach revives Neugebauer's original interpretation as

 modified by Bruins' introduction of reciprocals and other subsequent improvements.
 In H0yrup (2002 and earlier) ground-breaking papers, H0yrup showed that much
 of Old Babylonian mathematics rested upon a geometrical foundation variously char-

 acterized as "naive" or "cut and paste" geometry (H0yrup) or "metrical algebra" (Fri-

 berg), involving a series of procedures based on diagrams that may have been sketched

 on a sandy floor with a pointer. Babylonian mathematics appears to have developed
 around the practical needs and knowledge of surveyors at an early date, and subse-

 quently melded with the arithmetic of accountancy by the Ur III period, if not earlier.
 Whatever its precise chronology, it preceded P 322, and some of the basic construc-
 tions, (Figs. 3, 4, 5 below) could have formed the background for its context.

 The notation in this part is chosen to be consistent with part I:

 - For a rectangle of length 1 (as in column I' of P 322) the width will be denoted by

 - For an arbitrary rectangle the width will be denoted by b, the length by a and the

 P and the diagonal by 8

 diagonal by d.

 The simplest "sand-stick" construction is shown in Fig. 3. It shows a relation

 between two concentric squares:

 Figure 4 shows the Old Babylonian representation of the Diagonal Rule:

 on

 Hence,

 a - (1/2 )c = b + (1/2 )c = l/2(a + b),

 (l/2(a+b))2 = ab+(l/2(a-b))2. (10)

 l/2(a+^) = V(A + ((l/2)c)2) (11)

 a = V {a + ((l/2)c)2} + (l/2)c. (11a)
 b = v{a + ((1/2)c)2}-(1/2)c. (lib)

 The mathematical contribution of P 322 is making a connection between the Diag-

 onal Rule, as shown in Fig. 4 and expressed in Eq. 9 and the procedure of completing

 the square, as shown in Fig. 5 and expressed in Eq. 10.

 Figures 4 and 5 are used by H0yrup (2002, pp. 257-261) to interpret the solution
 path and subsequent proof of the problem presented in Db2-146, a tablet from Esnun-

 na, dating to around 1 830, and thus probably (although not certainly) slightly earlier
 than P 322.

 The translation and transliteration of Db2 - 146 after Baqir (1962, pl. 2-3) and

 H0yrup (2002), pp. 258-259, with some corrections, is as follows.53

 Diagonal Rule was known in Esnunna by this date.

 Another example of quadratic completion, YBC 6967, is cited by Robson (2001,

 pp. 1 83-1 85) as illustrating the connection between P 322 and igiligibi problems. Here
 the difference in the above example is described as the excess of the igibi over the

 igi , i.e., igibi-igi=l , and the solution method is once again based on Eq. 10. The right
 side of (10) is calculated in line 9 below. The solution assumes that the product, igibi

 x igi= 60, leading to igibi = 12, igi = 5. The problem as defined, replaces conventional

 length and width with the slightly more abstract igibi and igi, thereby establishing the

 area of the subject rectangle indirectly, but otherwise has no bearing on the Diagonal
 Rule since 60 is not a square number (Fig. 7).

 The problem is to find the length (a) and the width (b) of a rectangle given the

 diagonal and the area. The solution procedure is explained as follows:
 Line 3: an "oblique" square is constructed on the diagonal (see Fig. 4).
 Lines 4-5: the four lateral 1/2 rectangles (total area 2 times 45 equals 1,30) are added
 to this oblique square (area 1,33,45), providing the area of the large square (3,3,45).
 Line 6: the side of the large square is obtained by taking square root ("3,3,45
 makes 1,45 equalsided"). This provides a + b. The scribe then computes 1/2 of this,

 (< a + b)/ 2, because he is considering the upper left quarter of Fig. 5 for the particular
 case ab = A = 45.

 Line 7-10: in order to calculate (a-b)l 2, the scribe subtracts from the area the gnomon

 (the grey area in Fig. 5) which equals the area of the initial rectangle and calculates
 ((< a + b)/2)2 - ab = ((a - b)j 2)2, Eq. 10 above.
 Lines 1 1-12: a and b are calculated by adding and subtracting (a + b)/2 and (a - b)/2.

 There are several things worth noting: First, for the calculation of ( a - b)/ 2, the
 scribe could calculate the area of the small square by subtracting the four lateral 1/2
 rectangles from the oblique square (as in Db2-146), but he prefers to focus on the
 gnomon. Second, in this example the half-sum and half-difference relate the length
 and the width, whereas in P 322, half-sum and half-difference relate the width and the

 diagonal. Third, line 6 involves finding a square root, and the result will not always be
 a finite sexagesimal. For a particular problem with d2 + 2 A a perfect square, i.e., the

 square of a finite sexagesimal (in line 6, *J(d2 + 2 A) = 1,45), the solution procedure
 gives a + b = y/(< d 2 -1- 2 A), see Eq. 1 1 above. If (a + b)/2)2 - A is also a perfect
 square, 1/2 (a - b) = J((a + b)/2)2 -A = J ((1/2 (a + b))2 - ab) (lines 10,11,
 (i a -b)/2 = 7,30), then the length a and width b are both finite sexagesimals. This is

 fine for a single problem, but what if the problem is to generate a list of examples as
 in MS 3971 #3?

 554 J. P. Britton et al.

 MS 3971 #3 (Friberg 2007, pp. 252-254) gives five examples of how to compute

 8 and /3 from pairs of reciprocals, all of which are among the 23 entries which would

 have completed P 322. Removing any doubt as to the object of the exercise, the section

 is introduced as " assum 5 silipatum amarika - in order for you to see (i.e., construct)

 5 diagonals - and concludes with the summary emphasis "5 silipatum ".

 poorly in the following series of igi / igibi.

 /in-si/; Friberg omitted to restore this sequence in his transliteration.

 is no reason that it appears in the end of the line 5, in the damaged part.

 this sequence, which could be restored.

 As noted by Friberg, the term siliptum means both the diagonal and the rectangle.

 The algorithm applied in these five examples is based on the relation

 Thus if 8 = 1/2 (igi + igibi ), and A = 1, then 82
 0 = 1/2(i^i - igibi) (Fig. 8).

 5 diagonals.

 This relation is a particular example of Fig. 5, and Eq. 10, with b replaced by 1 la,

 and the area ab of the gnomon in the upper left corner equal to 1. The difference

 between the squares is not geometrically a square, but rather the shaded gnomon with

 area 1. Indeed it is the property of the number 1, that the result of its multiplication by

 itself is still 1, that makes Eq. 5 a general algorithm for finding sets of numbers which
 obey the Diagonal Rule:

 (1/2 (a + b ))2 - (1/2 (a - b ))2 = (1/2 (a + 1 /a))2 - (1/2 (a - 1/a))2 = 1 = l2

 (12)

 The significance of this step can hardly be overstated, for it represents a distinct depar-

 ture from the purely geometric demonstrations which preceded it towards a relationship

 depending on the properties of numbers , and which was, in fact, not demonstrable by
 traditional techniques. The essential insight, that l2 = 1, which also reflects a dif-
 ferent application of terminology and understanding of reciprocation than is found
 in YBC 6967, appears explicitly in line 7 of MS 3052 #2, with the consequence that
 S2 - ft2 = 1 is a relation involving a triple of square numbers.

 The problem defines a in expression (8) as the "igi" = 2 and asks for the length,

 width and diagonal of the rectangle this is assumed to define. The text then steps pains-

 takingly through the solution, first calculating I /a = 0; 30, then a + I /a = 2; 30,
 then 1/2 (a + 1 /a) = 1; 15, which it declares to be the diagonal, <5, revealing an
 implicit assumption that the length ostensibly sought is equal to 1 . At this point one

 might expect the calculation of the width as /? = 1/2 (a - 1 /a), but instead the text
 follows the diagonal algorithm and computes the width as

 Plimpton 322 557

 p = j(s2-'2).

 carefully remarking in line 7, that "1, the length, multiplied by itself, gives 1" (1 us
 du7. du-j-ma 1 in-si). This 1, i.e., I2, is then subtracted from <52 to give thence p,
 which corrected for typos56 is found to be 0;45 (see again Fig. 10).

 MS 3052 #2 misstates its problem and assumes, rather than finds, a rectangle of unit
 length. Nevertheless, its careful explanation that 1x1 = 1, suggests the central role

 which this observation played in the discovery of the diagonal algorithm. The fact that

 the solution follows the path of the Diagonal Rule, rather than simply assuming the

 diagonal algorithm, also suggests that the latter was a novelty, to be used sparingly, and

 that following the Diagonal Rule to a solution was regarded as a sounder procedure
 than relying entirely on the diagonal algorithm.

 MS 3052 #2 departs from the conventions reflected in YBC 6967, most obviously

 in assuming that product igixigibi = 1, rather than 60, but also and more subtly
 in associating igi with the length (the longer dimension) and igibi with the width
 (the smaller dimension). In YBC 6967 the opposite convention is employed, and igi
 is associated with the shorter of the implicit dimensions and igibi with the longer
 one. Whether this is significant or happenstance is unclear, but it is interesting that

 it appears in association with a different basis for reciprocation, the discovery of the

 diagonal algorithm, and a move away from geometrical towards more purely numerical
 analysis.

 In MS 3971 #3 the area <5 2 is found, and then the side is computed as the square

 root of <5 2 - 1.

 The similarities between MS 3971 #3 and P 322 are striking:

 - Both are underdetermined problems. While the MS tablet gives five samples, P 322
 gives the complete list of solutions in a given set of numbers (see in part I the
 conditions on rand s).

 - In both texts, the samples are numbered by the index "ki + N".

 This suggests that the problem solved in P 322 is a kind of generalization of the
 problem solved in MS 3971 #3. The problem of P 322, which could be formulated by

 something like "In order for you to see all the diagonals". Moreover, the indexing of
 samples by the "ki + N" system is a unique feature, not attested in other mathemati-

 leaving it infected with a distressing number of errors, of which inexcusably omitting column I' from the
 "transliteration" of Plimpton 322 on page 434 is only one example of many.

 cal texts,57 and thus could reveal that authors of P 322 and MS 3971 were sharing a
 common scribal culture.

 558 J. P. Britton et al.

 2.3 A new approach to P 322

 First, let us consider the heading of column V .

 The number square [takilti] of the diagonal [siliptim'(8) from which 1 is sub-
 tracted and (that of) the width [sag](/i) comes up.

 The terms "diagonal" and "width" leave no doubt that the subject of column V is a
 series of rectangles whose diagonals and widths, denoted (column IV') by 8 and j$,
 are related as described in the heading of column I' as:

 82 = 1 +yS2.

 The relation described in the heading could be illustrated in Fig. 9:

 In fact, the text does not say explicitly that the 1 that is subtracted is a square. Nor

 does it say that the result after subtracting is a square, rather, "sag ///«", that is, "the

 width comes up." It seems that the term "sag" actually is being used for the square with

 side /?, which would explain the appearance of the term "lb-sis" in columns IF and III'

 which refer to linear dimensions. Or it may be that takilti is being used to refer to both

 the sag and siliptim. Another important point is, as explained in Part I, that the use
 of the term "takiltum " suggests that the square with side p, the takiltum, is included

 in the square with side 8 as in Fig. 10 below, with a gnomon of area 1 in between.

 In any case, the appearance of the term takiltum is significant, because it reflects the

 configuration illustrated in Fig. 10, the square of side {$ is contained in the square of

 side 8 which is the configuration appearing in the method of "completing the square".

 A derivation of the algorithm underlying the examples in MS 397 1 #3 and MS 3052

 #2 can be given in the spirit of Old Babylonian mathematics by cutting and pasting
 the "leg" of the gnomon in Fig. 10 producing a rectangle of area 1 and sides 8 +
 and 8 - ft, as in Fig. 11.

 Thus

 1 =82-p2 = (8+p)(8-P)

 and the dimensions are reciprocal numbers igi and igibi:

 8 + f$ = igi and 8 - f$ = igibi

 The initial values ft and 8 can be then easily found by adding and subtracting the two

 equations,

 8 = 1/2 (igi + igibi) and = 1/2 (igi - igibi).

 With the examples of MS 3971 #3 as background, we offer our interpretation of

 the problem underlying P 322, which may be stated:

 57 A comparable system is attested in some omen texts (Glassner 2009).

 sions, in reduced form, without common sexagesimal factor (columns II' and III')"

 Something like this statement could have been noted in the heading of one of the lost

 columns. In this case, the heading of column I' may be interpreted as a verification of
 col. -1 and 0, as suggested by tablet Db2-146 (lines 16-25).

 Robson and Friberg consider the purpose of P 322 to be a "teacher's aid" for the

 setting of problems related either to the diagonal of a normalized rectangle or for rect-

 angular-linear systems of equations where either the sum or the difference of igi and

 igibi is known. To the contrary, we consider the text itself as presenting a challenging
 mathematical problem and its solution, comparable to the example given in M 3971
 #3, but complete.

 Let us come back to some problems:

 The absence of a column for the length of the normalized rectangle in the preserved
 part of P 322 should be explained. The length of third side is not listed because the
 purpose of columns II' and III' was to find the relationship between the dimensions,

 P (sag) and 8 ( siliptum ) in reduced form.

 560 J. P. Britton et al.

 In terms of floating sexagesimal notation the half sum or difference of reciprocals

 would be a product of two factors

 1/2 (r/s + s/r) - | V 2 + s2^ / (2 rs) = ^r2 + s2^ (2rs)

 where 2 rs represents the reciprocal of 2rs. Columns I I' and III' represent the result of

 factoring out the common factor (2 rs) in

 and

 5= (r2+*2)(2^).

 This is the same as what we would regard as expressing the ratio fi/8 in reduced
 form p/8 = n/d. Columns II' and III' may be regarded as completing a conceptual

 process not generally reducible to the single regular number, n/d , since with only two

 exceptions in Table 7, d is an irregular number. Moreover, the length of the "primitive"
 rectangle (/) is easily found as the reciprocal of common divisor of ^ and 8 , that is,

 the product of the factors which appear in the right sub-column when applying the

 trailing part algorithm to p and 8 (see Table 6). For example, for the data given in the
 table in Part I, above:

 In ki 2, the length of the "primitive" rectangle (/) is 2 x 12 x 12 x 12 (that is 57,36).

 In ki 15, the length of the "primitive" rectangle (/) is 3 x 30 x 30 (that is 45).

 Thus, the length of the "primitive" rectangle is automatically provided by the appli-
 cation of the trailing part algorithm to and <5. Friberg's explanation of columns II'
 and III' involves finding the "factor-reduced core" of the terms in column I', that is
 8 2, which goes hand in hand with his conclusion that "it was never the intention of

 the author of P 322 to reduce his series of normalized diagonal triples (with a length

 equal to 1) to a corresponding series of primitive diagonal triples (with the width, the
 length and the diagonal integers without common factors)." The difference between

 his approach and the method of the trailing part algorithm applied to and 8 in parallel,

 as demonstrated in Part I, is seen clearly in lines 2 and 15, where Friberg's reduction

 is carried out to a different number of steps for ft1 and 82. Thus, the entry in column
 III' line 2 (read as 3,13) and the entry in column III' line 15 (56) are not considered as

 errors, even though they do not give the correct pair of terms in a finite sexagesimal
 rectangle.

 Another problem is the hypothesis that the pairs and 8 derive from a set of igi
 and igibi pairs, r/s and s/r. In this connection it is noteworthy that problems C20 -
 C33 in the series text YBC 4668 (Neugebauer 1935-1937, pp. 430-43 1) involve ratios
 of lengths to widths, their inverses and their sums and differences, closely analogous
 to r/s, s/r, r/s + s/r, r/s - s/r, accompanied by the technical term and formula,
 "igi-te-en sa sag us-se", "relation of width towards length", which proves to be the

 ratio of length divided by width (us/sag). This shows that ratios similar to those under-

 lying P 322 were sufficiently remarkable to have a technical term describing them.

 Plimpton 322 561

 Interestingly, the parameters of the problem set, us = 30, sag = 20, are not components

 of a finite sexagesimal rectangle; nor is there any evidence in the text of awareness of

 the diagonal algorithm. Nevertheless, the product of such ratios and their inverses is

 clearly equal to 1, and it is not hard to imagine the discovery of the diagonal algorithm

 emerging from work with such problems.

 Finally, the appearance in MS 3971 #3 of 5 examples from the unfinished extension

 of P 322 suggests that a completed version of the tablet was known to the author of

 MS 397 1 . Remarkably, this text and MS 3052 are also the only evidence for knowledge

 of the underlying diagonal algorithm apart from P 322 itself.

 Seen in this light P 322 appears to be an elucidation, and perhaps even celebration,

 of the discovery of the bridge between the Diagonal Rule and the method of completing

 the square. As such, the tablet and its composition seem a much more deeply mathe-
 matical undertaking than simply constructing a pedagogical aid - something already
 suggested by the discovery that the scribe contemplated encompassing a complete
 set of reasonably defined arguments.58 The historical relation between the discovery

 and the text is not presently knowable. That they may have been contemporaneous is

 suggested by the lack of evidence, apart from MS 3052 and 3971, of either awareness
 or use of it until much later. Whatever the case, P 322 is mathematics as Neugebauer

 recognized, not exactly as Neugebauer understood it, but real mathematics focused on

 a discovery which significantly expanded the capabilities of the art. As such it appears

 far more deeply rooted than simply a utilitarian exercise in pedagogical convenience.

 This is not to argue that P 322 served no utilitarian purpose. Its headings clearly

 reflect a focus on the dimensional relationships of a set of rectangles intended to com-

 prise all rectangles of unit length for which ft < 1 and constructed from ratios of regular

 numbers to regular sexagesimal digits. The resulting distribution of the normalized

 rectangles preserved in the text is illustrated to scale in Fig. 12, whose components

 are readily scalable by any factor, regular or otherwise, further reason for assuming

 the presence of fi and S in the missing fragment.

 The link between the finite sexagesimal rectangles and problems involving partition

 of triangle and trapezoid59 was underlined by Vaiman (1961, pp. 192-206). Figure 13
 illustrates the relationship between the Diagonal Rule as conceptualized in P 322 and

 the bisection of the trapezoid (the light gray area) is equal to the dark gray one:

 In fact, Trapezoid Rule appears to have been known much earlier, as evidenced by

 IM 58045 (Friberg, 1990, p. 541), which dates from the Sargonic reign of Sar-kali-sari
 and describes the bisection of a trapezoid with sides 7 and 17, implying knowledge

 58 Extending s to 2 places, i.e., considering all reduced ratios for 1 < r/s < 1 ;24,5 1,10 and 1< s < 1, 0,
 0, yields few entries outside the range of Plimpton 322 if completed. These include the couple r = 52,5, s
 = 21,36 and p = 0;59,53,46,54,24 at the upper end of the range and at the lower end: the couple r = 4,10,
 s = 4,3 and = 0; 1,42, 15, 6,40; the couple r = 2,8, s = 2,5 and (5 = 0; 1,25 ,20, 15; the couple r = 52,5, s
 = 51,12 and fi = 0; 1,1, 34, 57, 40, 30; the couple r = 1, 21, s = 1,20 and £ = 0;0,44,42,30; and finally the
 couple r = 34, 8, s = 33,45 and f$ = 0; 0,40,39,33,26,15. Reflecting continuity and extended application of
 the algorithm the couple r = 1, 21, s = 1,2 w attested in the Seleucid text from Uruk AO 6484 rev. 10-27
 (Neugebauer 1935-1937, pp. 98-99; Friberg, 2007, pp. 444-447), where the problem set is to find igi (r/s)
 and igibi ( s/r ) given their sum as 8, 82, ft2 = 82 - 1 , f3, (5 + 8 = igi, f$ - 8 = igibi.

 59 These problems played an essential role in cuneiform mathematics since the third millennium, See for
 exemple the Old Akkadian tablet from Nippur IM 58045 (CDLI: P2 16852) and the analysis by Friberg of
 Ur III field plans (CDLJ 2009:3).

 Fig. 12 The 1 5 normalized rectangles of P 322

 Fig. 13 Bisection of the trapezoid

 of the trapezoidal triple, 7:13:17. Certainly, the 3:4:5 triple, conventionally expressed
 unreduced as 45:1,0:1,15, and its (reduced) trapezoidal equivalent, 1:5:7, were also
 known by this time, and it seems likely that all of the relationships described above
 may date from at least the Sargonic period, perhaps explaining the later reference
 noted above to the "Akkadian method".

 562 J. P. Britton et al.

 As a consequence, the triples 1 + p, <5, and 1 - associated with each line of P 322
 could be considered as giving a bisection of the trapezoids with parallel sides of length
 1 and p. Therefore it would have been a simple exercise to compute the parameters
 for trapezoidal bisection problems from the tablet P 322. Perhaps the line numbering

 in column IV' contemplated linkage with a second tablet with these parameters, the
 potential details of which appear in Appendix A. That the author may have had other

 practical purposes in mind seems perfectly possible but also wholly speculative. What
 seems less speculative is that - its occasional errors not withstanding - P 322 reflects

 a high degree of mathematical sensibility which distinguishes both it and its author
 from the typical standard of everyday Old Babylonian mathematical practice.
