 Abstract The current literature on history of science reports that Levi-Civita's par

 allel transport was motivated by his attempt to provide the covariant derivative of

 the absolute differential calculus with a geometrical interpretation (For instance, see

 Scholz in The intersection of history and mathematics, Birkhàuser, Basel, pp 203-230,

 1994, Sect. 4). Levi-Civita's memoir on the subject was explicitly aimed at simplify

 ing the geometrical computation of the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. In the

 present paper, we wish to point out the possible role implicitly played by the principle

 of virtual work in Levi-Civita's conceptual reasoning to formulate parallel transport.

 1 Introduction

 Tùllio Levi-Civita (1873-1941) was one of the leading Italian mathematicians of his
 time. He showed his attitude towards mathematics and mathematical physics in his

 high school days, when he offered an ingenious attempt to prove Euclid's fifth postulate

 on parallel lines under the supervision of his teacher in mathematics, Paolo Gazzaniga

 (1853-1930), a scholar in number theory.1 Levi-Civita took a degree in mathematics

 from the university of Padua, where among his teachers he had Giuseppe Veronese
 (1853-1917),2 Francesco Flores d'Arcais (1849-1927),3 Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro
 (1853-1925),4 and Ernesto Padova (1845—1896).5 Both Ricci-Curbastro and Padova

 provided Levi-Civita with a strong training in mathematical physics and mechanics.

 Ricci-Curbastro, in particular, provided him with firsthand absolute differential calcu

 lus methods, which were the inheritance of Beltrami's investigations on Riemannian

 manifolds Capecchi and Ruta (2015), Tazzioli (1993). Levi-Civita applied these meth

 ods to subjects other than differential geometry, such as mechanics. In 1902, he took

 over the chair of higher mechanics in Padua, vacant after Padova's premature death. In

 the some twenty years he spent in Padua until he was appointed to Rome, Levi-Civita

 investigated a vast set of subjects in analytical mechanics. In the mid-1910s Levi-Civita

 turned his attention to problems in both special and general relativity, treated analyti

 cally with the new powerful tools of the absolute differential calculus to which he had

 contributed.6 In particular, he studied the curvature of four-dimensional Riemannian

 manifolds, modelling space-time through the parallel transport of vectors over these

 manifolds. He took into account the curvature of the manifold by varying some parame

 ters along paths lying on the manifold. Indeed, at every point of the manifold it is possi

 ble to consider a linear structure, the tangent space, which can be linked to the tangent

 spaces at other points of the manifold through a well-determined new mathematical

 notion, later called a connection, which, thus, originates from parallel transport.7

 In the mathematical literature, we usually read that Levi-Civita's parallel transport

 was motivated by his attempt to give a geometrical interpretation to the so-called
 covariant derivative of absolute differential calculus. In addition, according to Nas

 tasi and Tazzioli (2005), Levi-Civita defined parallelism on a Riemannian manifold

 through a new formulation of the law of inertia for a point moving on a geodetic line.8

 With respect to Levi-Civita's original procedure in Levi-Civita ( 1917), we believe that

 such an interpretation is possible only a posteriori, within the framework of a global
 variational calculus. The same can be said for the consideration of Levi-Civita's par

 allelism as a local geometrical interpretation of covariant derivative, as in Pizzocchero

 2 Veronese spent a period of time studying in Leipzig under the supervision of Felix Klein (1849-1825).

 He provided contributions to projective hyper-spaces and non-Euclidean geometry.

 3 Flores d'Arcais graduated in Pisa, and had Enrico Betti (1823-1892) and Ulisse Dini (1845-1918) among
 his teachers. He is well known in the Italian school of mathematics of the days for his excellent handbooks
 on calculus.

 4 Ricci-Curbastro graduated in Pisa having Betti, Dini, and Eugenio Beltrami (1835-1900) among his
 teachers. He perfected his studies with Klein and, jointly with Levi-Civita, is considered the father of
 absolute differential calculus.

 5 A pupil of Beltrami, Padova investigated mathematical physics in non-Euclidean spaces.

 6 It is well known that Albert Einstein (1879-1955) claimed to feel indebted with him for absolute calculus.

 7 Parallel transport and linear (affine) connection were introduced almost simultaneously by Levi-Civita,
 Gerhard Hessenberg (1874—1925), Hermann Weyl (1885-1955) and Jan Arnoidus Schouten (1883-1971) in

 connection with Einstein's general theory of relativity. Levi-Civita used (local) embedding of a Riemannian

 manifold in some η -dimensional space. Weyl introduced parallel transport (hence, linear connection) on

 arbitrary differential manifolds on a completely general basis, that is, with no reference to Riemann metrics,
 see Maurin (1997), ch. 1, Sect. 1.1.

 (1998).9 On the other hand, in this paper we point out a possible a priori interpretation

 of the intrinsic origin of Levi-Civita's parallelism based on the tacit use of schemes

 of analytical mechanics and the principle of virtual work.

 If we read Levi-Civita's paper Levi-Civita (1917) carefully, we see that Levi-Civita

 aimed at simplifying the computation of the curvature of a Riemannian manifold by

 re-examining the covariant behaviour of the Riemann symbols.10 In pursuing this, he

 devoted the first fourteen sections of his memoir to introducing and explaining paral

 lelism on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold V„ of dimension η >2. From examining

 these passages, we believe that Levi-Civita's strong education in mathematical physics

 had a remarkable role in his developments by tacitly influencing his fashion of formal

 reasoning. This was also due to the fact that, at that time, geometry and mechanics
 had evanescent boundaries, and a language with many common traits and analogies

 of meaning.

 To begin with, when Levi-Civita considered tangent spaces at the various points

 of the manifold, it is apparent that he tacitly adopted equations formally analogous

 to those of virtual displacements compatible with a set of constraints. The implicit

 mechanical interpretation of a Riemannian manifold as the space of the configura

 tions of a mechanical system with a finite set of degrees of freedom, subjected to a

 set of holonomic constraints, is indeed possible and conceivable. Even if nowadays

 this interpretation is standard, see Arnold (1986) for instance, we cannot take it for

 granted at the beginning of the 20th century. Levi-Civita himself remarked that some

 of his conditions were those of admissible first-order constrained displacements. Nev

 ertheless, this is only one of the possible interpretations of how Levi-Civita could have

 proceeded in setting up and solving his initial aim of simplifying the computation of

 Riemann's symbols.

 Indeed, Levi-Civita's condition of parallelism is expressed by the vanishing of a

 linear form built on the tangent space at a point of the manifold: it is apparent that such

 a statement has many a formal resemblance with the well-known principle of virtual

 work, deeply rooted in the Italian school of mathematical physics since the pioneer
 ing works by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813). Indeed, the use of various forms

 of the principle of virtual work may be found in all scholars in Italian mathematical

 physics and engineering, such as Gabrio Piola (1794-1850), Betti, Beltrami, Luigi
 Federico Menabrea (1809-1906), Carlo Alberto Castigliano (1847-1884), Valentino
 Cerruti (1850-1909) Capecchi and Ruta (2007,2010,2011,2015), Ruta (2014), Ben
 venuto (1991), Todhunter and Pearson (1893), Timoshenko (1953). We cannot but

 infer that such a key idea had a strong influence on the writings of Levi-Civita, edu

 cated at the same school, and this mechanical interpretation of Levi-Civita's condition

 of parallelism is a possible, plausible historical interpretation. Moreover, it was Levi

 Civita himself who provided an additional expression of his differential condition of

 parallelism in a form that is exactly like Lagrange's general equation of analytical

 mechanics. Piola's influence on the school that led to Levi-Civita is put forth and

 suggested also in Andreaus et al. (2015).

 Thus, from our historical analysis it emerges that the principle of virtual work

 could have been among one of the conceptual guides, or mental schemes, to build up

 Levi-Civita's notion of parallel transport. This is corroborated also by what we find in

 Bottazzini (1990), where the primary role played by the new results of general relativity

 is stressed among the motivations of Levi-Civita's memoir of 1917 Levi-Civita (1917).

 In the following, we first sketch some hints of the origin and the various formulation of

 the principle of virtual work in the history of mechanics. Then we point out its possible

 conceptual role in the early origin of the formal notion of parallel transport due to Levi

 Civita, by examining its presentation in the original paper Levi-Civita (1917).

 2 Some hints on the principle of virtual work

 Broadly speaking, in modern textbooks of mechanics we find that a system of bodies

 is balanced if and only if the total power on any admissible (virtual) velocity field

 vanishes. Passing from power to work means only a rescaling by a small time interval

 St, and we get the principle of virtual work. Since the second half of 18th century, the

 law of virtual work saw no appreciable changes from the formulation by Lagrange,
 who in the first edition (1788) of his Mécanique analytique put Johann Bernoulli's

 principle of virtual velocities at the base of mechanics.

 To be precise, in 1788 Lagrange (1853) Lagrange identified three main paradigms

 in the history of statics, i.e. the lever, the composition of forces, and the principle

 of virtual work. The paradigm of the lever would have been in force from antiquity

 until up the early 18th century, when Pierre Varignon (1654-1722) worked out the

 (de-Composition of forces Varignon (1725) by the graphical constructions known as

 polygon of forces and funicular polygon Capecchi and Ruta (2015). The principle of
 virtual work would become dominant after Lagrange. However, Lagrange's predic

 tion was never fully realized because the principle of virtual work did not replace the

 (de-)composition of forces, but at most outflanked it Capecchi (2012). Furthermore,
 Lagrange's picture is too schematic: indeed, some form of virtual work laws have

 always existed in mechanics, even though with limited applications. Arabic and Latin

 mechanics of the Middle Ages called attention to such a law, while in the Renaissance

 we begin to see different wordings of it, often proposed as unique principle of statics.

 The process reached its apex with Johann Bernoulli and Lagrange, and the French

 school adopted Lagrange's principle of virtual work, and applied it to continuum
 mechanics.

 A major difficulty in the formulations of virtual work laws is the status attributed to

 constraints and their reactions. Before the 18th century, constraints had been treated

 only as passive elements; after accepting models of matter based on particles consid

 ered as centres of forces, constraints began to be thought of as capable of providing

 forces.11 Lagrange stated that "the use of these forces released [us] from [the need of]

 taking into account the constraints among bodies, and allows one to make use of the

 11 According to Lagrange Lagrange (1853), in the period 1736-1742 the Bernoullis, Alexis Clairaut (1713

 1765) and Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) were among the first to assimilate constraint reactions to active
 forces.

 laws of motion of free bodies".12 In statics, constraint reactions are less problematic,

 since they can be considered as the forces necessary to maintain the constraint. The

 first to introduce them in calculations was probably Varignon (1725). It was the diffi

 culty of incorporating reactive forces in a consistent mechanical theory that led Johann

 Bernoulli to formulate a law of virtual work, known after Lagrange as the principle of

 virtual velocities, which provides a balance criterion without the intervention of these

 undesirable entities. Johann Bernoulli's statement is "the sum of the powers each of

 them multiplied by the distance travelled from the point where they are applied, in

 the direction of this power, will always be zero".13 Lagrange in his Mécanique ana

 lytique suitably reformulated Bernoulli's principle, shifting from his previous use of

 the principle of least action. Even today, the principle of virtual work is considered
 more general than that of least action, because it also allows non-conservative forces
 to be taken into account. However, as a result of the heated discussions that followed

 the publication of Lagrange (1853), Lagrange changed his mind, and in the second

 edition (1811) of the Mécanique analytique he remarked that the principle of virtual

 work is not obvious enough in itself to be selected as a founding principle.14 There

 were also technical difficulties such as the question of the admissible displacements

 to consider, and whether they should be compatible with the constraints.

 In order to formulate Lagrange's expression of the principle of virtual work, fol
 lowing him we must accept that inertia is another force, and add it to the active ones.

 Thus, the total force on a particle vanishes, and all problems of dynamics are reduced
 to those of statics.15

 In modern language, Lagrange's principle of virtual work states that a system of

 particles is balanced when the active forces ("puissances", i.e. powers) F,· to which it
 is subjected satisfy16

 SL = £ Ft ■ iPf = 0, (1)

 i

 where δ Pi is the first-order displacement of the point of application of F,·. Thus, if a

 system is in equilibrium, the virtual work of all active forces Fj will vanish for any
 virtual displacement.

 To keep into account constraint reactions Rj also, we must add their work to that

 of the active forces in Eq. (1). With this aim, we add the definition, implicitly assumed

 by Lagrange, of smooth constraints. In modern terms, we assume that the work of

 the reactions due to smooth constraints is non-negative for any irreversible virtual

 displacement, while is zero for any reversible virtual displacement,17 In the special,

 forces plus inertia, since smooth constraints spend no work on admissible displace
 ments.

 yet fondamental, case of bilateral constraints, expressed by equalities, all compati
 ble virtual displacements are reversible. Hence, we assume that the virtual work of

 constraint reactions is zero, then the principle of virtual work reads

 SL = 0, (2)

 If the constraints are holonomic, they are expressed as equalities in the intrinsic

 parameters of the system, and the vanishing of the virtual work of constraint reactions

 assumes an interesting expression. This will become apparent in the following, where
 we consider how such an expression may have probably influenced Levi-Civita's

 notion of parallel transport.

 3 Levi-Civita's parallel transport

 In Levi-Civita (1917), Levi-Civita introduced his contribution by claiming that the

 absolute differential calculus opened the way to Einstein's theory of gravitation; and,

 since handling such technicalities was so important, he found it necessary to simplify

 the calculation of intrinsic curvature. Thus, he went on, it was fundamental to begin

 with the notion of parallelism in a Riemannian manifold.19

 Levi-Civita started by considering two directions a, a! emerging from two infin
 itesimally near points Ρ, P' of the Riemannian manifold Vn, embedded in an
 /V-dimensional Euclidean space Sn

 In Sn, the two directions α, a' are parallel if

 angle ^5, fj = angle ^5', fj (3)

 for any auxiliary direction / emerging from P. Parallelism on Vn is defined by requir

 ing that the condition in Eq. (3) holds for any direction / of the plane TpN ( Vn) tangent
 to Vn at P. This definition is intrinsic, since it depends on metrics in V„, not in the

 embedding space Sn.

 Levi-Civita emphasized that this condition depends on the path joining Ρ with Ρ',

 being independent only in Euclidean spaces. Along a geodetic line, the tangents keep

 their direction: this is a generalization of an intuitive property of a straight line in a

 Euclidean space.20

 18 Also said to be D'Alembert-Lagrange principle as reformulated by Lagrange, Arnold (1986), ch. IV, or
 general equation of virtual work, Belluzzi (1961), vol. I, ch. XV, Sect. 318. See also the references in the

 previous footnote.

 559

 The key idea underlying parallelism in a Riemannian manifold, according to Levi

 Civita, is therefore expressed by Eq. (3) for two arbitrary concurrent unit vectors (germs

 of directions in modern language), the origin of which moves along an arbitrary path
 on the manifold.

 Levi-Civita considered generic metrics21 on an arbitrary finite-dimensional mani

 and embedded Vn in a Euclidean space Sn with sufficiently great dimension Ν <

 η (η + l)/2, so that it may be described by the system23

 yv = yv(Xh---,Xn), υ = 1,2 Ν (5)

 where the yv are coordinates in Sn, while the xn are intrinsic coordinates on Vn.

 Remark that Eq. (5) describes also a discrete mechanical system with η degrees of

 freedom subjected to Ν smooth holonomic bilateral constraints. This is a key point of

 our possible interpretation of Levi-Civita's parallelism notion: the shift from a point

 on Vn to one nearby is subjected to Eq. (5), hence its expression is analogous to the

 admissible velocity field (or, modulo a rescaling, to the field of virtual displacements)

 of an analog constrained mechanical system. It seems to us that Levi-Civita's education

 in mathematical physics clearly emerges here.

 Levi-Civita considered an arbitrary direction of Sn by the unit vector /, with

 direction cosines fv, and another arbitrary direction at a point Ρ of V„. This last is

 characterized by the unit vector a with direction cosines av with respect to Sn (of

 course, since Vn is embedded in the ambient space Sn, each direction belonging to Vn

 also belongs to Sn)·

 The point Ρ may be thought of as varying on a smooth curve C lying on V„, parame
 terized by the abscissa s in Eq. (4), thus av = αυ(ί). Let *,· = Xj(s), i = 1,2,..., η
 be the intrinsic parametric equations of C. Then, C may also be represented by the
 parametric equations yv = )ν(ί), ν — I,..., Ν when it is thought of as embedded
 in S ν via Eq. (5). Indeed, since Xi = Xi(s), i = 1,..., n, it is possible to write

 C = yv(s) = yv(xi(s),xn(s)), ν = 1,..., Ν. (6)

 It is apparent that, in the analog constrained system, s is an evolution parameter that

 may be thought to coincide with time, and C is a trajectory in the manifold of admissible

 configurations.

 21 In doing so, Levi-Civita was the first to deal with forms of pseudo-Riemannian structures, see Bottazzini
 (1990), pp. 305-306.

 which is a linear form on the direction cosines of the direction a of Vn.

 When Ρ varies along C, ordinary parallelism in S ν implies the equality of the angle

 between a and a direction / arbitrarily chosen. Levi-Civita introduced an intrinsic

 notion of parallelism in Vn by considering two nearby points. He considered an arbi

 trarily fixed direction / of Sn, the direction cosines of which are fv, and the cosine

 of the angle between / and a

 where a prime indicates a derivative with respect to s. Thus, Levi-Civita obtained the

 direction cosines with respect to Sn, while x{ are the direction cosines of the same
 unit direction with respect to Vn.

 Levi-Civita supposed that at each point Ρ of C there is a direction a of Vn, the
 direction cosines of which are ξ('\ i = 1, 2,..., η with respect to Vn, and av, ν =

 1,... ,N with respect to Sn- Then, Eq. (7) yields25

 implies that the cosine provided by Eq. (9) undergoes the variation

 The ordinary parallelism between a and / would require Eq. (10) to vanish when

 / varies in Sn, implying that av is uniform. Levi-Civita, however, imposed, as an

 intrinsic condition of parallelism, the weaker condition that the angle between a and
 / be constant when / varies on Vn. That is, he supposed the variation in Eq. (10) to

 be zero only for the directions that are tangent to Vn as Ρ varies along C.

 Levi-Civita claimed26 that these directions are exactly those compatible with the

 constraints (5). According to us, once again this is a hint that he had clearly in mind

 for any variation &yv, that is, in the analogous holonomic discrete mechanical system,

 suitable mechanical interpretation of the a'v(s), for instance by considering them as
 a kind of mechanical action in Sn, Eq. (11) is a formulation of the virtual work

 principle in Sn related to the smooth bilateral holonomic system defined by Eq. (5),
 hence related to a Riemannian manifold.28 As already said, in this paper we wish

 to emphasize this formal analogy, which might conceptually have led Levi-Civita to

 work out his intrinsic geometrical notion of parallelism.

 From Eq. (5) it follows that29

 to have an intrinsic definition, it is necessary to involve only parameters regarding Vn.

 To this aim, one has to replace the direction cosines av with their expression given by

 Eq. (8), so to involve the intrinsic direction cosines ξ^, and to deduce31

 where the alk are the components of the reciprocal form of (4). Levi-Civita showed

 that Eq. (14) may be expressed by the covariant quantities associated with the

 so that the intrinsic condition of parallelism has the same form of Lagrange equations
 of motion on a Riemannian manifold.34

 Thus, the intrinsic conditions characterizing Levi-Civita's notion of parallel trans

 port of the direction a along C as a function of its directional parameters ξι,..., ξη

 with respect to Vn fall within the framework of absolute differential calculus. Further

 more, in the following sections of Levi-Civita (1917), Levi-Civita did not make any

 explicit mention of covariant derivatives, except for a hint about Ricci-Curbastro's

 rotation coefficients.35 Then, Levi-Civita applied parallel transport to a Riemannian

 manifold by making it possible to compute its curvature. So, it seems apparent to

 us that, at least up to the definition of intrinsic parallelism, one possible key guide

 to Levi-Civita was mathematical physics, not only pure geometry, and, in particular,

 the principle of virtual work for a mechanical system subject to smooth holonomic

 bilateral constraints, which may be considered as a formal guide-scheme in deducing

 geometrical features.

 4 Final remarks

 From a historical standpoint, we claim that the virtual work principle played a possibly

 remarkable conceptual role in the origin of Levi-Civita's notion of parallel transport

 in a Riemannian manifold as expressed by Eq. (11) and its consequences. Coherently

 with his mathematical-physical education, Levi-Civita used a language which clearly

 referred to this principle and its formal schemata, for example when he used the term

 'constraint' and the expression 'displacements compatible with constraint'. Further

 more, he specified that Eq. ( 11 ) was obtained "for all the displacements Syv compatible
 with the constraints (5)" (our translation), and emphasized this sentence in italics (see

 Levi-Civita 1917). This is, according to us, a sign of a clear wish to refer to the so

 called symbolic equation of statics for an ideal mechanical system moving along a
 line C of a Riemannian manifold. Such an equation is a nullity condition expressing

 constitutive properties of smooth constraint reactions.36 Indeed, for the analog con

 strained mechanical system, the unit directions emerging from the points of V — η

 assume the role of admissible displacements, and the dual forms on them are reactions

 provided by the geometrical links between the elements of the mechanical system.37

 In a series of Spanish conferences held by Levi-Civita in 1921, the reference to

 analytical mechanics is more explicit.38 Indeed, in discussing parallelism and curvature

 33 Levi-Civita used the term 'moment', which was traditional in the Italian school of mathematical physics

 of his time and denoted a mechanical action dual to a Lagrangian parameter of admissible (virtual) dis

 placements.

 On the role of virtual work in Levi-Civita's parallel transport

 563

 in a general Riemannian manifold, Levi-Civita stated39 that the geometric notion

 of parallelism resembles the physical notion of work. This is to say that geometric

 parallelism, in its analytical substratum, is similar to the integral of the differential form

 Xjdxi + X2dx2. Starting from this initial physical framework, Levi-Civita provided

 a purely analytical treatment of his notion of vectorial equipollence upon a surface.

 Then, he discussed infinitesimal parallelism and its analytical expression by arguing

 in terms of vector analysis, and reached a simple, characteristic formal condition of
 parallelism on surfaces, given by the scalar product τ χ du = Ο,40 where r is a

 generic unit vector of the tangent plane to the given surface, and du is the first-order

 infinitesimal variation of a generic vector u belonging to the same tangent plane.

 Afterwards, in Levi-Civita (1924), Sect. 4, p. 103, Levi-Civita started to speak

 explicitly of "virtual displacements" and "symbolic equation" (we believe that he

 understood "of statics"), and the virtual displacements were called into question many

 times in his formal arguments, until he reached an equivalent formal expression of

 r χ du = 0, that is to say, S Ρ χ du = Ο,41 which recalls—Levi-Civita stated—the

 principle of virtual work (Levi-Civita 1924, Sect. 4, p. 104). From this point onwards,
 Levi-Civita used arguments of analytical mechanics, following a method similar to

 one that applied the virtual work law to build up Lagrange's equations (Levi-Civita

 1924, Sect. 4, p. 109). Thus, he deduced equations (14) for a two-dimensional surface.

 In Levi-Civita (1924), Sect. VIII, Levi-Civita generalized his results to an arbitrary

 Riemannian manifold with a simple dimensional extension of the formal model just

 worked out in a two-dimensional environment, until he had generalized the notion of

 parallelism to an arbitrary manifold in Levi-Civita (1924), Sect. IX. Then, he deduced

 equation (11), which now he stated to be "valid for all virtual displacements" (Levi
 Civita (1924), Sect. IX, p. 122).

 In Levi-Civita's monograph devoted to absolute differential calculus,42 we find

 further ex-post confirmation to our possible historical interpretation. Indeed, in this

 monograph there are many references to the possible kinematical characterization

 of parallelism in a Riemannian manifold. Levi-Civita also quoted works from the
 early 1920s by Giuseppe Corbellini43 and Enrico Persico (1900-1969)44 on other

 possible kinematical interpretations of his own intrinsic parallelism making use of

 the geometry of developable surfaces.45 Levi-Civita further emphasized the possible

 role of analytical mechanics in developing notions of differential geometry such as

 39 Levi-Civita (1924), Sect. 2, p. 99.

 40 Levi-Civita (1924), Eq. (1), p. 102. Note that in the Italian school of mathematical physics of the time
 the symbol for the scalar product was x.

 41 Levi-Civita (1924), Eq. (1'), p. 104.

 42 Levi-Civita (1927), ch. V, (b), Sects. 10-15. This monograph was suggested by the mathematician
 Edmund Taylor Whittaker (1873-1956), who wanted to widen the first Italian edition of 1925 with the

 addition of a third part, devoted to the physical application of absolute differential calculus to Einstein's
 general relativity, extracted from Levi-Civita (1928).

 43 We could not find any biographical data on him so far, apart from the fact that he published some notes

 on intrinsic parallelism.

 that of parallelism, reaching as far as a formal equation characterizing his notion of

 parallelism, equivalent to (and called by him) the symbolic equation of parallelism.

 Furthermore, and this is very important for our argument, Levi-Civita himself stated

 that this equation formally recalls the principle of virtual work. In addition, Levi

 Civita used the same principle in deducing another formal property of Riemannian

 geometry applied to Einstein's general relativity, for instance when discussing the

 geodetic principle for the dynamics of a material particle moving in a four-dimensional

 space-time manifold.46

 Thus, we have shown that the great tradition of the Italian school of mathematical

 physics of the second half of the 19th century continued in the early decades of the 20th

 century to produce important results also in the field of 'pure' mathematics that were

 strongly connected with the most advanced physical issues of the time, i.e. Einstein's

 theory of general relativity (Bottazzini 1990, ch. XVI, Sect. 3).

 We have stressed what possible formal schemata Levi-Civita followed in deducing

 his intrinsic, geometric notion of parallelism in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold,

 starting from the two-dimensional model provided by a material point moving along a

 smooth surface according to analytical mechanics. Our historical reconstruction of the

 possible mental route followed by Levi-Civita in working out this primary notion of

 differential geometry is corroborated by both the formal analysis of the content of his

 original 1917 memoir (in which our interpretation is supported by the identification of

 an implicit use of a formalism analogous to that of analytical mechanics) and by the

 analysis of two main texts of Levi-Civita drawn up soon after: his 1921 contribution to

 a Spanish conference (included in Levi-Civita 1924) and his 1923 lectures recollected
 in Levi-Civita (1927).
