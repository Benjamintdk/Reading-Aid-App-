 Abstract The development of ancient civilizations and their achievements in
 sciences such as mathematics and astronomy are well researched for script-using
 civilizations. On the basis of oral tradition and mnemonic artifacts illiterate ancient

 civilizations were able to attain an adequate level of knowledge. The Neolithic and

 Bronze Age earthworks and circles are such mnemonic artifacts. Explanatory models

 are given for the shape of the stone formations and the ditch of Stonehenge reflecting

 the circular and specific non-circular shapes of these structures. The basic mathemat-

 ical concepts are Pythagorean triangles, thus adopting the construction procedures of

 the Neolithic circular ditches of Central Europe in the fifth Millennium BC and later
 earthworks and stone circles in Britain and Brittany. This knowledge was extended
 with new elliptical concepts. Approximations for the values of n and the square root

 of 2 are encoded in the henge. All constructions were performed using a standardized
 "Babylonian" metrology that shows a remarkable consistency and comprehensible
 development over some 14 centuries.

 1 Introduction

 In ancient script-using civilizations, the achievements in mathematics and astron-
 omy have been investigated to an adequate degree (e.g., Neugebauer 1969, 1975; van
 der Waerden 1954, 1973, 1983). In illiterate ancient European civilizations, there is

 some evidence of basic astronomical knowledge due to prehistoric monuments and
 earthworks (Thorn and Thorn 1980), but there are almost no secured findings about

 the level of mathematical knowledge. Because there are many identical solutions for
 mathematical problems in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, India,
 China and Greece, van der Waerden assumed a common origin for the basic math-
 ematical concepts, which he placed in Neolithic Europe (van der Waerden 1983).
 Two examples should highlight the basis of this supposition: (a) in all the above-
 mentioned civilizations, the Pythagorean Theorem was used, and a common set of

 Pythagorean Triangles was known and/or calculated in the same way; (b) in India and

 in Greece, comparable ritual geometric constructions were performed (generally for
 the shapes of altars). This assumption was supported by earlier articles of Seiden-

 berg (Seidenberg 1961, 1978, 1981). A figure summarizing these findings of van der
 Waerden is included as Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM Fig. 1). In illiterate
 civilizations, knowledge is generally transferred by oral tradition to subsequent gener-

 ations. Mathews proposed an ancient core of a Neolithic oral tradition of mathematics
 (Mathews 1985). In addition, the knowledge can be documented by the depiction of

 illustrating pictures or symbols on mnemonic objects (e.g., Vansina 1985; Haarmann
 1991) or by the construction of appropriate devices and monuments. The majority
 of the Neolithic and Bronze Age earthworks and stone/wood rings are object of this
 mnemonic procedure. The encoding of the mathematical concepts in these monu-
 ments was performed by the appropriate construction of ditches and rings which
 are composed by circles and circular arcs. With their centers and endpoints, these
 elements determine the geometrical models. This procedure is distinct from the docu-

 mentation of geometric problem solutions nowadays. With the present method, linear

 geometric models are depicted directly by their line segments, while in the ancient

 monuments, the linear geometric models are represented exclusively by the respective
 vertices.

 The principal objective of the investigation of ancient earthwork and stone/wood

 rings now is to determine the original construction concept. So much effort in the con-
 struction of these outstanding monuments could not have been expended without a

 comprehensible and consistent plan. A determination procedure comprising six steps
 was established to work out highly probable concepts of the ancient plans (see Sect. 8,

 Fig. 13). Two steps have to be explained at this point to familiarize the reader with the
 often-used terms "backward construction" and "forward construction." A backward

 construction is the deduction of a potential construction concept from the available

 data of the plan of the ancient monument's present remains. There might be several

 attempts and different results in this step for the search of the original concept. The

 six-step determination procedure aims to reduce these options to preferably one plau-

 sible plan. The forward construction is the exact construction based on the selected
 mathematical concept and the established metrology.

 This article is concerned exclusively with the construction concepts of the

 Stonehenge structures. Some efforts have been there to uncover the principles of
 the Stonehenge constructions, e.g., the early attempt by the use of computers in the
 early 1960s (Hawkins 1965). However, this statistical approach and other methods
 produced no satisfactory results. A new, sound approach was published by Johnson

 (2008), although the author cannot agree with the proposed mathematical explanation
 models (Johnson 2008).

 2 Z and Y holes

 We begin with the last phases of Stonehenge. Although the construction of the Z
 and Y holes document in some way a decline of the mathematical knowledge of the

 Stonehenge society, the construction concepts of these ring-like structures reflect the
 beginning in an especially descriptive manner. The Y and Z holes obviously do not

 form an exact circle. We encounter this characteristic in nearly all early rondels (cir-

 cular ditches) and wood and stone "circles" in Central Europe and Britain. In the case

 of the exact circles in Stonehenge (Aubrey holes, Sarsen circle), we will show a clear

 reasoning for these constructions. The basis of the construction of these ringlike struc-

 tures is always a mathematical concept. In the majority the construction starts with a

 Pythagorean triangle. The knowledge of Pythagorean triangles traces back to the fifth

 millennium BC (rondels/"Kreisgräben" in Central Europe).

 2.1 Z holes

 The construction of the Z holes is an excellent example of this procedure. To exemplify

 the a.m. determination procedure, we will depict the results of the backward construc-

 tion for the Z holes (Fig. la) and also the forward construction as well (Fig. 2). (For the

 remaining structures, a combination of the sampling points and the resulting forward
 construction is displayed, with the exception of the Bluestone horseshoe.) At first,

 an isosceles triangle (Z31Z32Z33) composed of two mirrored Pythagorean triangles
 of the shape (3,4,5) is constructed by sharing the leg "4." Then, another isosceles
 triangle, (Z31Z33Z34), also composed of two mirrored Pythagorean triangles of the
 shape (3,4,5) is attached, but in this case sharing the leg "3." The outline of the over-

 all geometry is another single Pythagorean triangle (Z32Z33Z34) of the shape (3,4,5)

 (Fig. lc). From a mathematical point of view, the basis for a Pythagorean triangle is

 a Pythagorean triple of three integers a, b, and c fulfilling the Pythagorean theorem

 a2 + b2 = c2. If these integers have no common factor, then they are called "primitive

 Pythagorean triples."1 In the depiction of the construction concepts by Pythagorean

 triangles, the integers i of the corresponding primitive Pythagorean triples are denoted
 by squared brackets: [/]. The position of the vertices Z31-Z34 (which are the centers
 of the respective circular arcs) are calculated by a nonlinear regression analysis (see
 Sect. 8); the sampling points for the regression analysis are depicted in Fig. la by
 a small cross symbol. The construction was performed on the basis of a consistent

 metrology (see also Sect. 7). The concrete length of the legs of the respective Pythag-
 orean triangles are 6, 8, and 10 cubits; the resulting overall shape is a Pythagorean
 triangle with legs of 12, 16, and 20 cubits. The position of vertex Z31 is near the
 generic center of the Stonehenge structures.

 1 For example, (6,8,10) is a Pythagorean triple; (3,4,5) is the corresponding primitive Pythagorean triple.

 Fig. 2 Forward construction of the Z holes. The isosceles triangles Z31 Z32Z33 and Z31 Z33Z34 and the
 circular arc with center Z31 are computed by a mathematical exact construction. The resulting curve for the
 Z holes is totally smooth at the stones Z 17, Z23, and Z30 compared to the one achieved by the backward
 construction

 The vertices Z31-Z34 serve as centers of circular arcs on which the stones of the Z

 holes were set (Fig. lb). The four circular arcs are composed in a reasonably smoothed
 curve starting with hole/stone Z7 and ending with hole/stone Z9 anticlockwise. The

 length of the radius of the first circular arc with center Z31 was arbitrary and was set 36

 cubits which equals six reeds or three rods. The lengths of the radii of the remaining
 circular arcs result from the smoothing procedure; the ring so defined was, there-
 fore, not smoothly closed between the holes Z7 and Z9. In the backward construction
 (Fig. lb), we still see minor gaps at the connection points Z30, Z23, and Z17. In the

 exact forward construction, the position of the starting vertex Z31 was set very slightly
 lower. This construction results in a totally smooth curve (in terms of mathematical

 continuity) at all connection points as is shown in Fig. 2. The lengths of the circular

 arcs could be determined by either the angle of the arc or the heading of the two legs.

 This procedure for defining the construction of the Z holes provides a blue print for

 the construction of all the ring-like structures of Stonehenge.

 2.2 Y holes

 As we will show later, the construction concept of the Z holes is somewhat simpler
 than that of the preceding phases 3ii and 3iv of Stonehenge. The Y holes show a
 further decline of the construction complexity. The base of the construction is only

 one Pythagorean triangle (Ï31 ^32^33) of the type (5,12,13); this is the simplest con-

 struction concept of all the ring-like structures of Stonehenge (Fig. 3b). The concrete
 lengths of the legs are 10, 24, and 26 cubits, thus starting the construction with a
 Pythagorean triangle of the shape (10,24,26). Once again the vertices of the triangle
 serve as the centers of the three circular arcs on which the stones were set. Vertex Y31

 again is very near to the general center of Stonehenge.

 The length of the radius y' of the dominant circular arc with center Y31 seems to be

 set arbitrarily to 50 cubits which equals five poles. The leg Y31 Y32 of the Pythagorean

 triangle and the radius Y32Y3 of the circular arc with center Y32 form a straight line;

 as the leg I31 Y32 is 10 cubits, the length of this latter radius is exactly 40 cubits which

 equals four poles. The length of the radius with center Y33 results from the smoothing
 procedure at hole Y15. In the backward construction (Fig. 3a), these two arcs meet

 each other at hole Y15 with a small gap, while the arc with center Y32 misses the main

 arc in the segment between the holes Y2 and Y3. In general, the holes/stones of the Y

 ring were not set with the accuracy of the Z ring. The shapes of three holes are outside
 the exact circular arc (Y20, Y25, Y29), and others do not hit the arc centrically. For

 the position of the hole/stone Y8, we have no mathematical concept. It could be an

 arbitrary determination to fill the gap between the holes Y7 and Y9. This additionally

 reflects the decline in the geometrical methods and accuracy for ring constructions in

 this last phase of the Stonehenge constructions.

 For the forward construction, the mean of the measures of the radii y' and yi were

 used; the radius y' provides the cubit measure with the least tolerance. In this forward

 construction, the position of vertex Y33 by an exact construction of the Pythagorean
 triangle (10,24,26) becomes a bit higher compared with the backward construction.
 This forward construction now results in a smooth curve at hole Y 15 and hole Y3 as

 well (Fig. 3c).

 2.3 Deduced measures

 ' The above mentioned cubit measures are ideal values according to the selected math-

 ematical concept - in these cases, the underlying Pythagorean triangles. The actual

 length values extracted from the plan are summarized in Table 1 A. For the Z holes, the
 resulting five cubit measures vary between 49.9003 and 51.4553 cm and have a mean
 of 50.7228 cm. The mean cubit measures of the Y holes are 52.3558 cm (backward

 construction) and 53.7403 cm (forward construction).

 The arbitrary radius z' of the circular arc with center Z31 with the supposed length
 of 36 cubits (= 6 reeds = 3 rods) results in a cubit measure of 50.4836 cm which is very
 close to the above established mean value for the Z holes. The radius y' of the circular

 arc with center Y31 seems to be set arbitrarily to 50 cubits (= 10 poles) and results
 in a cubit measure of 53.9227 cm which is again very close to the above established
 mean value for the Y holes (forward construction).

 3 Ditch and Aubrey Holes

 3.1 Ditch

 The ditch was excavated by Hawley in the early 1920s in the eastern and southern

 parts. As far as the original course and shape of the ditch is concerned, the excavation
 results have to be questioned. The excavated cross sections and the irregularities of

 both the width and the depth along the ditch ring are not in line with earlier and coeval

 rondels and ditches. In general, the bottom of the ditch should define a comprehensi-

 ble line or small band that reflects the original construction concept. The eastern ditch

 terminal at the entrance causeway is a good example for this critical analysis. Johnson

 assumed that "it is more than likely therefore that the workmen had mistakenly cut a

 little beyond the actual end of the ditch, slicing through the postholes on the edge of
 the causeway" (Johnson 2008, p. 103). It seems that the workmen had overdone their
 task in the rest of the ditch also. This open question can be resolved by an adequate
 investigation and cautious excavation of the remaining part of the ditch including
 non-destructive methods. For the generation of a potential construction concept, we
 have to cope with an unsettled database as far as the excavated ditch is concerned.

 The situation for the remaining non-excavated part of the ditch is at the present time
 somewhat better but not ideal; here, we can assume the construction curve in the

 middle of the still evident depression of the ditch. However, this can be an indication

 only due to the unknown refilling conditions. Despite this soft database, the backward

 construction provides a comprehensible mathematical construction concept (Fig. 4).

 76 A. Kainzinger

 For each of the two sections of the non-excavated part of the ditch, eight reading points

 were chosen. The reading points of the two sections of the excavated part are sampled

 on the basis of the sampling theorem at equidistant spaces of 5° as shown in Fig. 4c.
 This procedure provides 17 and 15 sampling points, respectively. The construction
 starts with the isosceles triangle D'DiDt> composed of two mirrored Pythagorean

 triangles of the shape (3,4,5) in this case sharing the leg "3" (Fig. 4b). This geometric

 figure (including the one sharing the leg "4") can be assessed as one with the highest

 appreciation and is therefore quite probable for the starting phase of the Stonehenge

 structures. These shapes of isosceles triangles were also the basis of many explanation

 models for the construction of stone rings in Britain and Brittany by Thorn and Thorn

 (1980). The construction of center D4 is not apparently due to the soft database for

 the respective circular arcs; this center could be identical either to the point Di or the
 center Ai of the Aubrey Holes (see below).

 The lengths of the legs of the triangle D' D2D3 are 6, 8, and 10 cubits. The lengths

 of the radius s' are the most reliable data for the deduction of a cubit measure. This

 length can be assumed 120 cubits which equals 20 reeds or 10 rods and results in a
 cubit measure of 48.8285 cm that fits to the overall measuring scheme (see Sect. 7).

 However,owing to the a.m. database situation, the determination procedure accord-

 ing Fig. 13 has to be assessed as non-successful. As both the construction concept
 and the deduced measuring unit fit in the overall explanation model of the Stonehenge
 structures, the ditch results are worthwhile to be documented.

 The 56 Aubrey Holes define an exact circle (Fig. 4a, c). The circle was calculated
 by circular regression analysis involving all the 56 holes. The center of this circle Ai
 is inside the triangle D'D2Ü^ (Fig. 4b). The construction of the 56 holes/stones is

 a good example for the encoding of mathematical concepts in earthworks by illiter-
 ate societies; thereby an approximation of the circle constant n is represented in the

 3.2 Aubrey Holes

 henge:

 radius of the Aubrey holes circle ta = 90 cubits = 9 poles (Table IB)

 circumference of the Aubrey holes circle c' = 56 poles;

 ca 56 poles 28

 dA 18 poles 9

 The mathematical concept is based on a regular polygon of 56 sides inscribed in a

 circle. The respective circular area Ac could be established by the method described by
 Johannes KEPLER (Wußing 2008, p. 439). This method also starts with an inscribed

 polygon composed of isosceles triangles providing the formula

 Ac = circumference x radius/2

 This formula is equivalent to Ac = r2n but does not need n explicitly. We get
 Ac = 92 x 28/9 = 252 pole2 = 36 x 7 pole2. We have no knowledge of the algebraic
 achievements of the Stonehenge people. An approximation of '/7 could, however, be
 established by the formula 'Ja2 ± b « a ± b/2a, which was used in Babylonian,
 Chinese, and Indian mathematics. "It seems that the [a.m.] approximations . . . were

 already known in pre-Babylonian mathematics" (van der Waerden 1983, p. 47); q.v.
 (Folkerts 2006, p. II 29-33). For v"7, we get VÏ = V32 - 2 & 22/3 and thereby
 '/252 ^6x22/3 = 16. Therefore, we have a solution for the problem "squaring the
 circle" in whole numbers: the area of a circle with the diameter 18 equals the area of

 a square with the sides 16. This proportion 18/16, alternatively, 9/8 is also applied in

 problem 50 of the Rhind papyrus (ca. 1650 BC, copied from an earlier papyrus of ca.
 1860-1814 BC) for the tasks "squaring the circle" and "circling the square" (van der
 Waerden 1983, p. 170).

 The deduced value 28/9 is the most accurate approximation for n at the beginning of

 the third millennium BC known so far. The establishment of this figure is an admirable

 mathematical achievement for this time horizon. "The Babylonians . . . always used

 7T = 3. This is also the value given by Vitruvius; and is found again in the Chinese
 literature." (van der Waerden 1954, p. 32). We will meet the approximation n = 3 in

 the structures of Stonehenge also (see Sect. 5.1.).

 3.3 Deduced measures

 The mean cubit measure for the ditch is 50.4931 cm (Table IB). The arbitrary radius

 ^i of the circular arc with center Di with the supposed length of 120 cubits or 2 ropes
 results in a cubit measure of 48.8285 cm. The radius r¿ of the Aubrey holes was set

 arbitrarily to 90 cubits or nine poles and results in a cubit measure of 49.6016 cm. Of
 all the measures deduced from the structures of Stonehenge, this measure is the one

 with the lowest range of error or the highest confidence as we have a complete circle

 with 56 sampling points all lying on an exact circle.

 4 Station stones and Heelstone

 The Station stones and/or holes display no circular or ring-like structure (Fig. 5a). The
 Station stones 91-94 determine a rectangle that is composed of two Pythagorean tri-

 angles (91-92-93 and 91-93-94 or vice versa 91-92-94 and 92-93-94); these triangles
 have the primitive shape (5,12,13) and are combined with the leg "13." The concrete
 length of the legs are 70, 168, and 182 cubits thus having a Pythagorean triangles of
 the real shape (70,168,182) and a multiplication factor of 14 compared to the primitive

 triangle. Another isosceles triangle composed of two mirrored Pythagorean triangles
 of the primitive shape (28,45,53) is added at the leg 91-94. This isosceles triangle has
 therefore the shape (56,53,53); the Heelstone 96 was placed at the top of this triangle.
 The concrete lengths of the legs of the Pythagorean triangles (28,45,53) are 84, 135,
 and 159 cubits; thus, the base leg of the isosceles triangle 91-94-96 is 168 cubits. This

 geometry represents the algebraic concept of the least common multiple (LCM) as
 168 is the LCM of the integers 12 and 56.

 Presently, the Heelstone 96 is leaning considerably toward SSE so we can assume

 an ancient construction point at the northwestern rim of the Heelstone's present image.

 The exact forward construction was rotated adequately to cope with this fact (Fig. 5b).

 The bearing from the center of the rectangle to the Heelstone 5c -96 has an angle to
 East of 39.65°. The deduced cubit measure is 49.2467 cm (Table 1C).

 The mathematics involved in the construction of the Sarsen stones shows a great leap

 forward compared with the preceding phases of Stonehenge. In this stage (ca. 2550
 BC) as well as in the later phase of the Bluestones, elliptical concepts were adopted.

 5 Sarsen stones

 5.1 Sarsen circle

 The Sarsen circle is a completely exact circle. For the circular regression analysis, all

 the 17 still standing stones were incorporated. The reading points were taken at the

 innermost edge of the stones. This approach provided a best fit of the regression circle

 with the exception of stones 10 and 1 1 which are not as exactly on the circle line as do

 all others (Fig. 6c). The radius of this circle with center Si is 30 cubits which equals
 five reeds. This supports the assumption that the inner faces of the stones were the

 basis for the construction concept as well as the fact that the inner faces of the uprights

 were made considerably smoother than the outer faces.

 By the construction of the 30 Sarsen circle uprights, we have another approximation
 of the circle constant n encoded in the Stonehenge structures. We have identified two

 options of constructions: (a) if we apply the concept of the Aubrey holes circle, then
 the circumference of the Sarsen circle was taken as 30 reeds:

 radius of the Sarsen circle rs = 30 cubits = 5 reeds (Table 2A)

 -> diameter ds = 60 cubits =10 reeds = 1 rope;

 circumference of the Sarsen circle cs = 30 reeds = 3 ropes;

 circle constant is it := - - = -

 cs 30 reeds 3 ropes

 ds 10 reeds 1 rope

 The mathematical concept bases again on a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, in
 this case with 30 sides, resulting in an integer value for n . For the area of the circle,

 we get Ac = 52 x 3 = 75 reed2. Applying the a.m. approximation for the calculation
 of a square root, we get V3 « 1 3/4 and for VÏ5 = V52 x3 «5x13/4 = 8 3/4.
 The solution for the problem "squaring the circle" in this case is: the area of a circle

 with the diameter 10 equals the area of a square with the side 8 3/4. This Sarsen circle

 approximation for n is worse than that established by the Aubrey holes circle some
 400 years ago, but in accordance with the practiced standards in Babylonia. Either
 the Aubrey holes' value of 28/9 was not communicated by oral tradition and it had
 fallen into oblivion, or it was a conscious decision to operate from now on with this

 simple integer value. The latter assumption could be motivated by having a more

 practical figure for circle calculations or because this change was related to ritual tra-

 ditions; Seidenberg et al. showed that in Greece and India "geometrical constructions

 were regarded important for ritual purposes" (Seidenberg 1961, 1978, 1981; van der

 Waerden 1983). (b) In the above mentioned concept, the angle of a singular isosceles
 triangle with base 1 reed and legs 5 reeds has a central angle of 11.478° which is
 significantly smaller than the theoretical value of 360° /30 =12°; relating to the full
 circle, we get a difference by the 30 triangles of 15.65° which could doubtless be

 recognized by the builders of the Sarsen circle. A construction which fits the 30-side

 polygon better into the full circle could be based on an isosceles triangle with base 1
 reed +2 palm = 38 palms:

 radius of the Sarsen circle rs = 30 cubits = 5 reeds (Table 2A)

 -* diameter ds = 60 cubits = 360 palms

 circumference of the Sarsen circle cs = 30 x 38 palms = 1 140 palms;

 circle constant is . n := - = - - -

 . cs 1140 palms 57

 ds 360 palms 18

 This value approximates n better than the value 28/9 = 56/18 established by the Aubrey

 holes, and can be seen as a direct improvement of the latter value by raising the numer-
 ator from 56 to 57. For the area of the circle, we get Ac = 52 x 57/18 = 475/6 =

 92 - 11/6 « 92 - 2 reed2. Applying the a.m. approximation for the calculation of
 a square root, we get V92 -2 ^9-2/18 = 8 8/9. The solution for the problem
 "squaring the circle" in this case is: the area of a circle with the diameter 10 equals

 the area of a square with the side 8 8/9.

 To settle for one of the cases (a) or (b), we need more secured data about exact and

 regular stone or wood circles in coeval earthworks.

 5.2 Sarsen horseshoe

 The seven Trilithons 51-54, 57, 58, and 60 form an ellipse. Five points in a plane

 always form one and only one conic section - in this convex situation exactly one
 ellipse. Hence, the accuracy of the seven reading points on the ellipse is remarkable
 (Fig. 6c). Once again the Trilithons were smoother at the inner faces, and therefore
 the reading points were also taken at the innermost edge of the stones. The fallen
 and broken Trilithon 59 was not incorporated in the computing as there are not suffi-

 cient data on the original position. However, the remaining eventually displaced base
 matches with the computed ellipse. The resulting major and minor axes of the ellipse

 generate the rhombus T2T4T3T5 and the rectangle TeTjT^Tg (Fig. 6a). Both geometric
 objects are composed of Pythagorean triangles of the shape (28,45,53). In the case of
 the triangle T6T%T9 (and the congruent triangles T6T7Ts, T6T7T9 and T7T^T9 alike),
 this fact is very impressive: these triangles have the concrete legs of 28, 45, and 53

 cubits (Fig. 6b). The results of the elliptical regression analysis including the standard
 deviation values are provided as ESM.

 The Trilithon 56 was not obviously constructed at a position on the elliptical curve.

 This upright was straightened in 1901, and its partner stone 55 has fallen and broken.

 The mathematics in the structures of Stonehenge 83

 For a later comment, we want to state here that the depiction of Trilithon 56 in Fig. 8a

 shows the alignment of the smoother outer face not perpendicular to the major axis of

 the ellipse but rotated some 10° anticlockwise. If we assume that stone 55 has fallen

 in a right angle in relation to its original alignment, then this statement holds for stone

 55 also. There are still reasonable and debatable arguments about the original position
 of both stones (Johnson 2008, pp. 136-140). Therefore, the determination procedure

 according to Fig. 13 breaks down after step 1.

 The exact mathematical forward construction of the ellipse matches with that of the

 plan with a high degree of precision (Fig. 6c). Surprisingly, the centers of the Sarsen

 circle and the Sarsen ellipse are not identical. However, there is a comprehensible math-

 ematical concept to explain this difference (Fig. 6d). The a.m. centers and the virtual

 point S2 configure the Pythagorean triangle S' S2T1 of the shape (3,4,5). The lengths of
 the legs are 3, 4, and 5 feet (Table 2A). The deduced foot measure is 29.8918cm. The
 ancient foot measures vary considerably, even on the basis of a stable cubit measure

 depending on different subdivisions of the cubit and the palm (Rottländer 1979).2 The

 deduced foot measure is therefore absolutely within the deduced overall measuring
 scheme. The displacement of the center Ti of the ellipse might be because the Sarsen
 horseshoe was thereby placed better in the middle of the Sarsen circle.

 5.3 Deduced measures

 6 Bluestones

 6.1 Bluestone circle

 Once again, the above mentioned cubit measures are ideal values according to the

 selected mathematical concept - in these cases, the underlying circle and the Pythag-

 orean triangles. The actual length values extracted from the plan are summarized in
 Table 2A. The cubit measure for the Sarsen circle is 48.8733 cm and that for the Sarsen

 horseshoe, 49.3194cm; the mean of all Sarsen stones' cubit measures is 49.2079cm.

 The Bluestone circle and horseshoe were constructed some 450 years after the setting
 of the Sarsen stones.

 The present record of the remains of the Bluestone circle comprises 27 stones of which
 12 have fallen. Hence, we can involve 15 stones in the determination procedure for
 the original construction plan. The original amount of stones generating the Blue-
 stone circle is estimated between 44 and 62 uprights (Johnson 2008, p. 158); thus,
 we can imagine a very dense ringlike structure. Despite there being only 15 secured
 original positions, the nonlinear regression analysis provides a clear picture (Fig. 7c).

 We obtain four circular arcs with centers B21-B24 with 5, 6, 3, and 3 reading points,

 2 Typical variations: foot on the statue of Gudea = 26.45 cm; 18 digit foot from the Nippur
 cubit = 33.199cm.

 correspondingly; the stones 40g and 47 are connecting points of the adjacent arcs.
 The circular arcs with centers B23 and B24 are calculated on the basis of three stone

 positions. As three points in a plane define one and only one circle, we get an exact
 solution for the respective centers. However, this accuracy is deceptive because the

 regression analysis is calculated without redundancy. In this case, a defective position

 of one reading point (stone) results directly in a defective position of the center, while

 the regression calculation of a circle on the basis of more than three points compen-

 sates much better for slight position errors. Therefore, the circular arc with center B24

 has the lowest probability in our assessment procedure as this arc has additionally a

 very small central angle from stone 47 to stone 31. Nevertheless, the results in com-

 bination with the deduced measure units pass our determination procedure according

 to Fig. 13 - with reservations as far as the center B24 is concerned.

 The construction starts with the Pythagorean triangle B2 1#22 #23 of the shape

 (12,35,37) and the size 12, 35, and 37 palms (Fig. 7b). Again, this primitive form
 of the Pythagorean triangle is a strong support in favor of this explanation model.
 Another Pythagorean triangle of the shape (5,12,13) is added to the first at the leg
 "35." As 35 is a multiple of 5, we get this triangle in terms of palms in the concrete
 shape of (35,84,91).

 The calculated radius of the circle with center B23 is 24 cubits which equals 4 reeds

 or 2 rods (see ESM Table 2). The construction of the ring on which the stones of
 the Bluestone circle were set started probably with this circular arc. The additional

 arcs were attached in a way to get a smooth curve; the ring does not close smoothly
 between the stones 31 and 32c (Fig. 7a). The exact forward construction (Fig. 7c)
 matches with the plan perfectly: the connection of the adjacent arcs at stone 40g is
 now totally smooth compared with the backward construction where the calculation
 provided a minor gap (Fig. 7a); the gap between stone 31 and 32c remains.

 6.2 Bluestone horseshoe

 As far as mathematics is concerned, the complexity of Stonehenge's construction con-
 cepts reaches its point of culmination with the Bluestone horseshoe. In combination

 with the holes 73-78 the stones/holes of the Bluestone horseshoe create a ring-like
 structure. The nonlinear regression analysis provides three ellipses (Fig. 8a): a large
 ellipse with center Bi, a smaller ellipse in SW with center B6 and another smaller

 the center Bn of the small ellipse NE was shifted perpendicular to the major axis of

 the large ellipse so that this center rests on this major axis (length of shift 9.2 cm);

 additionally this small ellipse was rotated anticlockwise so that the axes coincide (rota-

 tion 5.67°). The slight shift and rotation are within the respective confidence intervals

 of the regression analysis due to the input data situation: the original position of the
 now disappeared stones 73-78 cannot be established with the accuracy of the other
 elements of the Bluestone horseshoe.

 88 A. Kainzinger

 The basis of the construction concept of the Bluestone horseshoe is the lozenge
 B2B6B3BU composed of four Pythagorean triangles of the shape (5,12,13); each of

 these Pythagorean triangles has concrete legs of 5, 12, and 13 cubits. The large ellipse

 with center Bi defines the rectangle Z?i6#i7#i8#i9 and a regular lozenge B2B4B3B5

 composed of four triangles similar to Pythagorean triangles of the shape (28,45,53).
 The proportion of the legs "45" and "28" is 45/28 = 1.607 . . ., and therefore also a

 good approximation for the Golden Ratioof 1.618 . . . (Fig. 8b, c). The small ellipse SW

 with center Bo defines the regular lozenge BjB'oB^Bg composed of four right-angled
 triangles being similar to a Pythagorean triangle of the shape (48,55,73) (Fig. 9a).
 The ellipse BjBioB^Bg is significantly rotated anticlockwise by 16.362° in relation
 to the major axis of the large ellipse. We had stated above that the alignment of the

 great Trilithons of the Sarsen horseshoe might have been rotated the same way. This

 rotation of in the inner segment of both horseshoes may have a reason for astronomical

 or ritual purposes. The small ellipse NE with center Bn defines the regular lozenge

 £i2#i5 £13 #14 composed of four right-angled triangles also being similar to a Pythag-

 orean triangle of the shape (48,55,73) (Fig. 9b). Both small ellipses are tangential to
 the larger ellipse - the small ellipse SW with one tangent point and the small ellipse

 NE with two tangent points; hence, we can assume that the intention of the Bluestone

 horseshoe designers was to demonstrate this geometrical achievement.

 The positioning of hole/stone 79 gives another insight to the mathematics applied
 by the builders of Stonehenge in phase 3iv. (a) The line segment B'-79 has the same
 length as the semi-minor axis B'B2 (12 cubits =1 rod) thus giving with segment
 Z?2-79, the construction of the diagonal of a unit square or a geometrical representa-

 tion of y/2 (Figs. 8b, 9c). On the other hand, this diagonal equals the line segment
 #6-79 with a difference of 1.471 cm as established in the forward construction (Table

 2B). B' Be equals five cubits, and so we get an approximation for the square root of
 2 by 17/12 = 1.41666. . . (exact value 1.41421 . . .). "This approximation (1;25 in
 the Babylonian sexagesimal notation) frequently occurs in Babylonian texts" (van der
 Waerden 1983, p. 47). (b) We have shown above that the proportion of the major and
 minor semi-axes of the large Bluestone ellipse is an approximation for the Golden

 Ratio; the point 79 therefore divides the major semi-axis B' B5 in the Golden Section
 (Fig. 8b). We had assumed that the large ellipse was constructed on the basis of a
 regular lozenge based upon Pythagorean triangles of the shape (28,45,53). The con-
 struction of a Golden Section geometry as a first step cannot be excluded totally either.
 A construction method for the Golden Section as also described in the Elements by

 EUCLID is depicted in Fig. 9d. This open question could be resolved if the remains
 of the respective construction pegs would ever be found in the soil of Stonehenge. (c)

 For the special case of an ellipse with the axes in the proportion of the Golden Ratio,

 The construction of the four osculating circles at the vertices is a good first step for

 an ellipse approximation. The knowledge and use of this concept is absolutely within
 the scope of a society constructing ellipses. Once again, traces of ancient construction

 Fig. 10 Forward construction for the Bluestone horseshoe. The small ellipses with corresponding centers

 Bö and Bn are constructed similar to a Pythagorean triangle of the shape (48,55,73) and in the way that
 the indicated tangent points are achieved

 construction of an ellipse being tangent to another given ellipse can be achieved by an

 approximation procedure.

 We can interpret the structures of ancient rings and earthworks as large mnemonic

 artifacts. Fortunately, there are also handy ancient artifacts discovered in the proximity
 of Stonehenge which underscore the layout concept of the Bluestone horseshoe: the
 Bush Barrow gold lozenges. The large lozenge displays the underlying lozenge of
 the two small Bluestone horseshoe ellipses based upon a Pythagorean triangle of the

 shape (48,55,73). For the investigation, we use the scaled graphic rendering in Fig. Ila.

 The angles 41.121° in the determining triangle L1L3L2 matches the respective angles
 41.112° in the Pythagorean triangle (48,55,73) nearly exactly (Fig. lib). However,
 there is another way to confirm this explanatory model: when applying the determi-

 nation procedure according to Fig. 13 to the gold lozenge also, we have to establish a
 consistent metrology for the manufacture of the lozenge. The lozenge is now 18.55 cm

 Fig. 11 Bush Barrow gold lozenges, a Bush Barrow large lozenge. The lozenge defines the regular rhom-
 bus L2L3 L4L5. b The rhombus is composed of four Pythagorean triangles of the shape (48,55,73). Hence,
 the triangle L^LgL^ is a Pythagorean triangle of the shape (48,55,73) also, and this triangle has concrete
 legs of 48, 55, and 73 corns as well as the axes of the rhombus L2L3L4L5 having the lengths of 48 and
 55 corns, c Bush Barrow small lozenge. The lozenge defines the regular rhombus L12L13L14L15.il The

 long; it is considerably compressed at the corners, and the original size should be

 slightly larger due to the crumbling of the plate. Let us, therefore, assume as working
 hypotheses that the original distance between the vertices L3 and L5 was 19 cm. 19 cm

 divided by 55 provides 0.34545 cm; taking this measure as a unit for the "corn" mea-
 sure, we have to multiply by 144 and get a cubit measure of 49.7455 cm. This cubit
 is equivalent to the established cubit for the Bluestone horseshoe of 49.9506 cm (2B).

 Hence, the triangles L^LgLe (and L^L^L^ alike) are Pythagorean triangles with the
 concrete legs of 48, 55 and 73 corns and the axes of the lozenge have a length of 48
 and 55 corns, respectively.

 The small Bush Barrow gold lozenge was not manufactured with the precision and

 artistry of the large one. The production of this tiny plate may date back to the early

 phases of the manufacture of gold plates. This plate could have been passed over gen-

 erations to the man to whom it was attached in his tomb. The marvelous large lozenge

 seems to reflect the culmination of that kind of plate. Nevertheless, the small gold

 lozenge could have played a comparable role. For the backward construction, we use
 a photo as no adequate scaled rendering is available (Fig. lie); therefore, we have to

 take into account potential slight photographic distortions. The backward construction

 is very close to a regular rhombus composed of Pythagorean triangles of the shape

 (28,45,53) (Fig. 1 Id). This Pythagorean triangle is the basis of the construction of the

 large ellipse of the Sarsen horseshoe, and the large ellipse of the Bluestone horseshoe

 as well. The length of the major axis of the small lozenge is 3. 1 cm; the division by 45

 yields a measure unit of 0.06888 cm - far below the unit of a corn. We have no secured

 sources for a subdivision of the unit corn in antiquity. Following the old English unit

 "(shoe) iron" of 0.0529167 cm (1/48 inch), let us denote this potential unit an "iron".

 A subdivision of a corn by six irons yields a cubit measure of 59.5199 cm and a sub-

 division by five irons of 49.5999 cm. The latter measure matches with the established

 cubit measure scheme for Stonehenge, although this can only be an indication.

 6.3 Deduced measures

 The actual length values extracted from the plan are summarized in Table 2B. The
 mean cubit measure for the Bluestone circle is 50.0340 cm, and the mean for the

 Bluestone horseshoe 49.9506 cm. As both values match to a high degree, we have
 established a mean cubit measure for all Bluestones of 49.9923 cm.

 7 Metrology

 All measurements of the Stonehenge structures are based on a consistent metrology.

 This metrology is in line with practiced standards in Babylonia concerning both the

 principal system of measures and the concrete measures.

 Verifications of mathematical constructions without written sources get an addi-

 tional affirmation if they are based on a consistent and coherent metrology and corre-

 spond with coeval verified systems of measures. In the construction of the Stonehenge

 structures, length measures were used as we encounter them in Babylonia. A preferred

 unit to compare ancient measures of length is the cubit. In the common Babylonian

 system of measures, a cubit was subdivided into six palms, a palm into four (st. five)
 fingers, and a finger into six corns; six cubits equal one reed and 12 cubits equal
 one rod; 10 cubits equal one pole, and 10 reeds equal one rope (Trapp and Wallerus
 2006).3 The unit 10 palms was also a used measure; this unit is commonly denoted as

 Megalithic yard (my) (see also ESM Fig. 2). The system of measures used in the geo-
 metrical construction of Stonehenge conforms to this Babylonian system. We have

 identified respective cubit measures for the phases of Stonehenge under investiga-

 3 The Babylonian corn measure differs from the old English barleycorn measure. In the latter case, the
 basis for the measure is the length of a barleycorn while a Babylonian corn (še) is about the third of this

 measure and seems to represent the width of a corn.

 tion. The length of the cubit has a comprehensible development scheme from phase 1
 (ca. 2950 BC) to the end of phase 3vi (ca. 1600 BC) (Fig. 12). A considerable increase
 in length measures in times of decline is an often-noticed fact. The cubit measure
 49.99 cm established for Stonehenge phase 3iv (ca. 2100 BC) corresponds with the
 coeval Babylonian cubit of Lagash of 49.61 cm.4 This Lagash value is identical to the
 cubit measure of the Aubrey Holes of 49.60 cm, which we had identified as the cubit
 measure with the lowest range of error. Hence, the consistency of the Stonehenge
 measuring system is a strong support favoring the established mathematical concepts
 encoded in the structures of Stonehenge.

 4 The cubit of Lagash was documented on a statue of Gudea of Lagash. The current status of research does

 not provide exact data for the ruling time of Gudea. New approaches vary from 2140 to 2060 BC.

 8 Methods

 The construction of exact circles in ancient earthworks and stone/wood rings can be

 verified easily. The deduction of construction concepts of noncircular, ringlike struc-

 tures without written sources is a complex task with a considerable number of pitfalls.

 To avoid misinterpretations to a great extent and to work out a highly probable solu-

 tion a six-step determination procedure was established (Fig. 13). In terms of science

 theory, this procedure should be taken as final conclusions as "scientific proofs" for

 concepts of illiterate societies are hardly to be established. An explanatory model for

 a potential construction concept can be accepted only if all steps of the procedure are

 passed successfully. The procedure can break down at every step - except step 4.

 Step 1 If the plan of the present situation of the monument does not contain sufficient

 data, then the procedure should be canceled at this point. Secured correction can be

 made, e.g., if the original position of a leaning stone is obvious.

 Step 2 To establish circular or elliptical arcs in the backward calculations in a repro-

 ducible manner, nonlinear regression analysis methods are inevitable.

 Step 3 If the selected construction concept does not match with a consistent system

 of measurements, the procedure should be canceled at this point (exception: similar
 transformations).

 Step 4 The forward construction yields an exact mathematical construction model.

 Step 5 Owing to both the decay of ditches/stones/holes and the potential imprecise

 construction of individual elements of the original monument, the concept of step 2

 is no exact model in general. Therefore, slight modifications of the measure, position

 and alignment of the step 4 model can be made in step 5. If this forward construction

 model results in a worse matching compared to the backward construction, then the

 procedure should be canceled at this point in general.

 Step 6 The potential solution of step 5 should pass an overall assessment taking into

 account also superordinate arguments.

 The circles and circular/elliptical arcs in the backward calculation were computed
 by a nonlinear regression analysis. For the analysis of line elements (ditch, bank),

 preferable eight or more points of the respective section of the curve should be iden-

 tified. In case of particular irregularities of curved lines, the reading points should be

 taken on the basis of the sampling theorem, as performed in the line determination

 of the excavated part of the ditch. In case of stones and holes, the number of reading

 points is predefined. Centers of stones and holes were established by a visual approx-

 imation. The center of gravity of shapes should be taken if the shape has an irregular

 noncircular image and no additional information about the original center is available.

 The results of the regression analysis including the standard deviations are provided
 as Supplementary Material (ESM Tables 1-4).

 9 Summary

 All the stone structures of the Stonehenge enclosure and probably also the ditch were

 designed, constructed, and set on the basis of mathematical concepts. We could iden-

 tify only one exception: in times of an obvious decline of the mathematical traditions,

 the stone indicated by hole Y8 of the Y holes was set presumably arbitrarily. The major

 mathematical concept in the design of the Stonehenge structures is the application of
 Pythagorean triangles. This is in line with earlier and coeval earthworks and stone

 rings. Among the outstanding Pythagorean triangle (3,4,5), specific Pythagorean tri-

 angles were repeatedly applied in the construction concepts of Stonehenge: (5,12,13),
 (28,45,53), and (48,55,73) - the last two with considerable large rope lengths (see
 Table 3). The Pythagorean triangle (28,45,53) is applied for the design of both the
 ellipse of the Sarsen horseshoe and the large ellipse of the Bluestone horseshoe. The

 Pythagorean triangle (48,55,73) seems to be discovered in the forefront of the con-

 struction of the Bluestone horseshoe, and the design of the two smaller ellipses was

 dedicated to this discovery, while the shape of the large ellipse was designed in the tra-

 dition of the Sarsen horseshoe ellipse, indicating a practice bequeathed over centuries.

 The dedication of the Pythagorean triangle (48,55,73) to Stonehenge is underscored
 by the identical design of the Bush Borrow large lozenge. In general, Pythagorean
 triangles were composed to form rectangles, isosceles triangles, rhombi, and general
 polygons.

 The standard concept for the design of ringlike structures was the composition

 of circular arcs or - in the case of the horseshoes - elliptical arcs to predominantly

 smooth lines; we could notice the total closing of the line (mathematical continuity) in

 the Bluestone horseshoe only. In this phase, the application of mathematics with the

 involvement of elliptical concepts was at its peak. As far as geometry is concerned the

 construction of ellipses being tangent to a given ellipse is the highlight of the Stone-

 henge mathematical designs. The concrete construction method of the ellipses could

 not be disclosed. The encoding of approximations for the circle constant n (28/9, 3 and

 57/18 respectively) for the task "squaring the circle" and of the approximation 17/12

 for the square root of 2 in the construction of Stonehenge is another important achieve-

 ment as is the application of the law of similitude. The a.m. concepts are encoded in

 the structures of Stonehenge. It can be assumed that the general level of mathematical

 achievements in the Stonehenge society was remarkably of a high standard - with a

 distinct culmination in phase 3iv and an obvious time of decline in phase 3 vi (Y holes).

 The used length metrology corresponds with common Babylonian systems of mea-
 surement based on the unit of a cubit, broken down till the measure of a corn and

 summed up to the measure units reed, pole, and rope. Systems of measurement change
 rarely; we can, therefore, assume a common origin of these metrologies noticeable
 before the time under consideration. In addition, this consistent metrology establishes

 high confidence in the described mathematical concepts.
