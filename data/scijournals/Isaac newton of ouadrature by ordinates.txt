 Abstract In Of Quadrature by Ordinates (1695), Isaac Newton tried two methods
 for obtaining the Newton-Cotes formulae. The first method is extrapolation and the

 second one is the method of undetermined coefficients using the quadrature of mono
 mials. The first method provides «-ordinate Newton-Cotes formulae only for cases
 in which η — 3,4 and 5. However this method provides another important formulae

 if the ratios of errors are corrected. It is proved that the second method is correct and

 provides the Newton-Cotes formulae. Present significance of each of the methods is
 given.

 1 Introduction

 Isaac Newton proposed the principle of numerical integration by polynomial interpo
 lation in Cor of Lemma V of Book III of his Principia (1687).

 Hence the areas of all curves may be nearly found; for if some number of points

 of the curve to be squared are found, and a parabola be supposed to be drawn
 through those points, the area of this parabola will be nearly the same with the
 area of the curvilinear figure proposed to be squared: but the parabola can be
 always squared geometrically by methods generally known (Cajori 1947, p. 500)

 Numerical integration formulae based on this idea of Newton's are called of inter

 polatory type. As an example, Newton gave the formula for four equidistant ordinates
 in Scholium of Prop VI of his Methodus Differentialis (1711) (Newton 1711).

 If there are four ordinates at equal intervals, let A be the sum of the first and
 fourth, Β the sum of the second and third, and R the interval between the first
 and fourth, then the central ordinate will be , and the area between the first

 and fourth ordinates will be A+gB R (Fraser 1927).

 This formula is so-called Simpson 3/8 rule. Roger Cotes published similar rules for

 the areas included between the curves of equidistant ordinates up to eleven ordinates
 in his posthumous Harmonia Mensurarum (1722). Therefore, numerical integration
 formulae by interpolation with equidistant ordinates are called the Newton-Cotes
 formulae or the Newton-Cotes rules.

 458 Ν. Osada

 The numerical integration formula of interpolatory type is usually applied not to

 the whole interval of integration, but to m equal subintervals into which the inter
 val is divided. The full integral is approximated by the sum of the approximations
 to the integrals on the subintervals. This method is called the m-panel composite
 formula.

 In the manuscript Of Quadrature by Ordinates (1695), which is abbreviated here
 to Of Quadrature, Newton tried two methods to obtain Newton-Cotes formulae. The

 first method is extrapolation and the second is the method of undetermined coefficients

 using the quadrature of monomials.

 The first method provides «-ordinate Newton-Cotes formulae only for cases in
 which η = 3, 4 and 5. In using the first method, it is necessary to know the ratio of
 errors of the single Newton-Cotes formula to the corresponding composite formula,
 but Newton's ratios of errors were incorrect. D.T. Whiteside called this first method a

 "Newton's clever (but not wholly exact) approach to achieving the Cotesian formulas"
 (Whiteside 1976, p. xliv).

 The second method has been considered as mere check of the formula. White

 side noted "If Newton had gone on similarly to check the accuracy of the area
 approximation in his preceding 'Cas. 5', he would (see note (12) above) have had
 a shock!" (Whiteside 1976, p. 698).

 In this paper, we study Newton's two methods for obtaining the Newton-Cotes

 formulae and re-evaluate the manuscript Of Quadrature.

 Since Newton used the theorem of Huygens, i.e., the first step of the Richardson

 extrapolation process, and the ratios of errors of the single to composite Newton-Cotes

 formulae, we will survey the theorem of Huygens in Sect. 2 and the error terms of the
 composite Newton-Cotes formulae in Sect. 3.

 In Sects. 4 and 7, we will annotate Of Quadrature and will quote the full-text of the
 Of Quadrature from Whiteside's translation (Whiteside 1976). We will also include

 Newton's original Latin in footnotes. In Sect. 5, we will deal with Newton's incorrect

 ratios of single to composite Newton-Cotes formulae. In Sect. 6, we will describe the

 modern significance of Newton's numerical integration formulae by extrapolation. In

 Sect. 7, we will prove that the Newton-Cotes formulae are determined by the second
 method.

 2.1 De circuit magnitudine inventa by C. Huygens

 In De circuit magnitudine inventa (Huygens 1654), Christiaan Huygens proved The
 orem XVI:

 Any arc less than a semicircle is greater than its subtense together with one
 third of the difference, by which the subtense exceeds the sine, and less than

 the subtense together with a quantity, which is to the said third, as four times
 the subtense added to the sine is to twice the subtense with three times the sine

 (Milne 1903)

 The lower bounds of ( 1 ) and (2) are the first step of the Richardson extrapolation
 which was called the theorem of Huygens by Newton. For details, see Osada (2012).

 2.2 Newton's application of the theorem of Huygens

 Newton referred the theorem of Huygens in the letter to Michael Dary on 22 January
 1675 (Turnbull 1959, p. 333; Whiteside 1971, p. 662). In this letter, Newton applied
 the theorem of Huygens to a construction of the length of the arc of an ellipse. Newton
 wrote

 This is derived from Hugenius' Quadrature of ye Circle, and I believe approaches
 ye Ellipsis as near as his doth the Circle (Turnbull 1959)

 Newton also mentioned the theorem of Huygens in the letter epistola prior to Henry
 Oldenburg on 13 June 1676 (Turnbull 1960, pp. 39-^H); Whiteside 1971, p. 669). Let
 A be the chord of an arc, Β the chord of half the arc. Let ζ be the length of the arc,
 and r be the radius of the circle. Then Newton derived

 Λ = 2 ~ 24^2 + 79207^ ~ &c'
 D Ζ Ζ3 ZS 0
 Β ~~ 2 ~ 192r2 + 61440r4 ~ &C'

 Newton eliminated the terms z3/r2 in Λ, £, and obtained

 7680r4 + &C'

 Newton stated:

 that is, ^(8Β — A) = ζ, with an error of only z5/7680r4 in excess; which is the
 theorem of Huygens (Turnbull 1960).

 3 Error terms in the Newton-Cotes formulae

 3.1 The trapezoidal rule of James Gregory

 James Gregory discussed numerical integration in his Exercitationes geometricae
 (1668) (Gregory 1668). As in Fig. 2, he divided the equally line segment AI into
 minimum parts. If the second differences of ordinates BP, CO,...,/// are equal to Z,
 Gregory stated:

 4 The first method of obtaining the Newton-Cotes formulae

 In the manuscript Of Quadrature by Ordinates, Newton gave two methods for obtaining
 Newton-Cotes formulae. The first method is extrapolation and the second one is the

 method of undetermined coefficients using the quadrature of monomials. We study

 the former in this section and the latter in Sect. 7 (Fig. 3).

 Isaac Newton's 'Of Quadrature by Ordinates' 465

 Newton gave the single trapezoidal rule in Case 1. In Case 2, Newton applied
 the single trapezoidal rule (6) and 2-panel composite trapezoidal rule (7) on
 / = are-d(AKMC). Let Γι = \(AK+ CM)AC and T2 = \{AK + 2BL+CM)AC.

 Newton used Corollary 1 which follows from Gregory's (5). Suppose Ζ = CM —

 2BL + AK = DN-2CM + BL = EO-2DN+CM, we have 4Z = EO- 2CM + AK.
 Then

 For m > 2, we can derive similarly that the error in the single trapezoidal rule is to

 the error in the m-panel composite trapezoidal rule as m? to 1.

 Newton derived T\ — T2 : T2 — I — 3 : 1 from (10). Since T\ — T2 — \(AK —

 2BL + CM)AC, Newton obtained

 which is the Simpson rule.

 Newton derived Si = + 4fiL + CM)AC from

 T\-I — X-{AK+CM)AC - Π(ΑΜ) = ^(ΕΟ - 2CM + AK)AC=l-Z■ AC.

 On the other hand,

 Therefore,

 The errors in the solutions will be as AD1 to AB2 or 9 to 1, and hence the difference

 in the errors—which is the difference ^(2AK — 2BL — 2CM + 2DN)AD in the

 the latter will remain as3

 Newton concluded:

 These are quadratures of the parabola which passes through the end-points of
 all the ordinates.7

 This sentence makes it apparent that Newton mistakenly thought that the numerical

 integration formulae obtained by extrapolation coincide with Newton-Cotes formulae.

 S Incorrect ratio of errors by Newton

 Newton used incorrect ratios of errors in the single to composite Newton-Cotes
 formulae in Of Quadrature as follows:

 Case 2 Γι - Ώ(ΑΜ) : T2 - O(AM) = AC2 : AB2 =4:1.
 Case 3 T\ - □(ΛΛ0 : T3 - Π(ΑΝ) = AD2 : AB2 =9:1.
 Case 4 Si - D(AO) : S2 - D(AO) = AE2 : AB2 = 16 : 1.
 Case 5 N\ — Π(Λβ) : N2 - □(Ag) = AG2 : AB2 = 36 : 1.
 Case 6 Bi- D(A5) : B2 - D(AS) = AI2 : AB2 = 64 : 1.

 Let Qm be m-panel composite Newton-Cotes formula of η ordinates for
 / = f(x)dx. Newton seemed to believe the following incorrect ratio of error
 in the single to composite Newton-Cotes formula:

 Q\ — I '■ Qm — I ^ (η — 1 )2m2 : 1. (incorrect form)

 ' Hae sunt quadrature Parabolae quae per terminos Ordinatarum omniu transit.

 The exact ratio is

 Q\ -/ : Qn

 m

 « + 1 . : 1. if η is odd,
 m" : 1. if η is even.

 See Davis and Rabinowitz (1984, p. 79) for the proof. For η > 2, the couples (n, m)
 for which Newton's ratios are correct by good luck are (n, m) = (3, 2), (4, 3), and
 (5, 2). The only incorrect case that Newton used is (n, m) = (4, 2), i.e. N\ — I :
 N2 — / = 36 : 1.

 Since "With Gregory's Exercitationes Newton was well familiar" (Whiteside
 ( 1976), p. 693), Newton knew the ratio of errors in the single to composite trape
 zoidal rule. Newton might generalize this case, i.e., η = 2. Whiteside noted "Newton
 in sequel seems to adopt the argument per analogiam that, where η + 1 equidistant
 ordinates are given, the corresponding ratio of the errors is η2 : 1, but this will fail
 him in 'Cas. 5'" (Whiteside (1976), p. 692).

 covered.

 for cases in which m is even. When m = 2, (25) coincides with Newton's (11). For

 cases in which m is a multiple of 3, Sheppard also gave

 When m — 3, (26) coincides with Newton's (16).

 (Milne-Thomson, 1933, p. 199) gave an exercise "By eliminating the error term
 in h4 between two Simpson formulae of 2ρ + 1 and Ap + I ordinates, obtain the
 Newton-Cotes' formula for η = 5." This exercise for ρ = 1 coincides with Newton's
 (19).

 Newton's 9-ordinate rule (24) is appeared in the fourth column. We remark that the
 fourth, fifth,... columns are not composite Newton-Cotes formulae. See Ralston and
 Rabinowitz (1978, p. 124).

 7 The second method of obtaining the Newton-Cotes formulae

 Newton proposed a method of determining the values of coefficients in Newton-Cotes

 formulae in the last part of Of Quadrature. Newton stated:

 These quadratures may also be ascertained in this manner. Let a be the sum of
 the first and last ordinates, b the sum of the second and next to the last ones,

 c that of the third and next but one to last, d the sum of the fourth from the

 beginning and the fourth from the end, e the sum of the fifth from the beginning
 and the fifth from the end,..., m the middle ordinate and A the abscissa, and

 let there be Zit+2y+2t+2v+2t+7 ^ = ^ reciu'recl' Then in place of the ordi
 nates write first an equal number of the opening terms of this series of square
 numbers 0, 1,4, 9, 16, 25,... ; next, as many first terms of this one of cubes
 0, 1, 8,27,64, 125,... ; thereafter the same number of this one of fourth powers
 0, 1, 16, 81, 256,..., so proceeding (if need be) to as many series, less one,
 as there are unknown quantities z, y, x, v,..., and in place of the quadrature
 required write the quadrature of the parabola to which these ordinates accord.

 There will ensure equations from which, when they are collated, z, y, x, ■ ■ . will
 be determined.8

 For instance, if there be four ordinates, I set α = 0 + 9, b = 1+4, Λ = 3
 and the quadrature = 9. In this way there comes to be x 3 = 9 and

 thence y = 3z. Therefore in place of y I write 3ζ and the equation |Λ = □

 becomes g(a + 3b)/l = □, as in the third case.9
 Again, if there be five ordinates, I set α = 0 + 16, b = 1 + 9, c = 4, Λ = 4 and

 □ = y, and thus there comes to be '2^2°/+** χ 4 = y, that is, 8z = y + 2s.
 Again I set α = 0 + 64, b — 1 + 27, c = 8, A —4 and □ = 64, and in this way

 there comes 642^4f228vv^8,Î χ 4 = 64, or 8z = y + 2s as above. I therefore put [a =

 0 + 256, b = 1 +81, c = 16, A = 4 and the quadrature = -y^. And in this way

 there comes to be 2562i^22^vi6,< x4 = or384z — 88s = 51>> = 408z— 102s,
 that is, 14s = 24z or 7s'= 12z and hence 7y = 32z. Accordingly, in place of

 s and y I write ψ ζ and ψζ respectively, and the equation yr+^ΓΓΓ ^ = ^

 becomes ^(7a + 32b + \2m)[A] = □, as in the fourth case.] 10

 Newton proposed the second method under two assumptions.

 1. The coefficients of the Newton-Cotes formula are symmetric about the coefficient

 2. The n-ordinate Newton-Cotes formula is exact for 1, x2,..., xn~l. When η is

 of the the central ordinate.

 odd, this is exact for 1, x2,..., x"

 The first assumption is correct. See, Davis and Rabinowitz (1984, pp. 77-78) for
 the proof. The second assumption follows from Proposition 2(i), 3(i), and 4(i), for
 η = 3,4, and 5, respectively. For the cases in which η is greater than 5, see Davis and
 Rabinowitz (1984, pp. 79).

 Let η be a fixed odd number greater than 2. Let χ,· = xo + ih (i — 1)

 For the rest of these, the determination of the coefficients is similar to the odd case.

 Although Newton wrote "These quadratures may also be ascertained in this

 manner", the Newton-Cotes formulae can be determined by the second method.

 In the twentieth century, Newton's idea has been formulated as the following Propo

 sition 5 which is used for determining the integration formulae of interpolatory type,

 such as Gaussian integration.

 8 Conclusion

 In Of Quadrature by Ordinates, Newton tried two methods for obtaining the Newton
 Cotes formulae. The first method is extrapolation and the second one is the method of

 undetermined coefficients using the quadrature of monomials.

 The first method provides n-ordinate Newton-Cotes formulae only for cases in
 which η = 3,4 and 5. However, this method provides another important formulae
 if the ratios of errors are corrected. Newton's numerical quadrature by extrapolation,

 i.e., the first method, is not systematic but can be said to be a germ of the Romberg

 integration.

 The second method is proposed under two assumptions. We proved that two assump
 tions are correct and that the second method provides the Newton-Cotes formulae. In

 the twentieth century, the second method has been formulated and used for determining

 the integration formulae of interpolatory type, such as Gaussian integration.
