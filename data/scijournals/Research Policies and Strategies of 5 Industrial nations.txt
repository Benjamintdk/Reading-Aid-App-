 DISCUSSION PAPER

 Research Policies and Strategies of Five Industrial Nations,
 and Implications for the United States

 Leonard L. Lederman, Rolf Lehming, and Jennifer S. Bond

 National Science Foundation

 Editor's note: From time to time, we intend to publish

 papers drawn directly from the practice of science policy
 analysis. We were pleased to invite the present contribu-
 tion as a first instance. Discussion of the issues raised here

 is welcome in the form of letters to the editors or longer
 comments.

 This article is drawn from a background paper
 prepared for the Government-University-Industry
 Research Roundtable. This body was convened
 under the auspices of the National Academy of
 Sciences, with membership from the scientific com-
 munity, industry, and government, to examine the
 organization and conduct of research in the United
 States in light of current and future needs of, and
 demands on, science. To help in this exercise, the
 Roundtable has considered what aspects of the re-
 search policies and strategies of other advanced in-
 dustrial nations might be relevant for United States
 science.

 The article examines similarities and differences

 among the research systems, strategies, and policies
 of France, Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom,
 and West Germany, and the United States; their
 government research funding systems and coordina-
 tion mechanisms; efforts to assess the effectiveness

 and results of research; some research outputs; and
 dissatisfactions currently being expressed in most or
 all of these countries. The paper concludes by pos-
 ing some questions for consideration in science policy
 discussions in the United States. A comparative
 table shows selected data on the distribution of fund-

 ing, performance, type of research and development
 (R&D) personnel.

 General Similarities and Differences

 The research systems of the six nations have some
 broadly similar features. Governments provide the

 bulk of academic research support and distribute
 it through a mix of agencies whose central func-
 tion is the support of science, and through mis-
 sion agencies which support science as part of their
 responsibilities in health, education, agriculture, and
 the like. All governments have some mechanisms
 for negotiating a balance between governmental and
 scientific interests in setting research directions and
 priorities. In all nations, academia conducts most
 fundamental research and trains future scientists and

 engineers; industry performs most applied research.
 All governments provide big science facilities for use
 by academic scientists and engineers, and also main-
 tain government laboratories. (2,3,4,9)

 The European nations and Japan share some fea-
 tures that distinguish their research systems from
 that of the United States. The governments of these
 nations have traditionally supported higher educa-
 tion and academic research as a means of transmit-
 ting and enhancing the national culture. Therefore,
 national, government supported university systems
 are the norm, and private universities and colleges
 are rare. In all nations but the United States and
 Japan, all qualified students have a right to higher
 education, pay no or low tuition costs, and often can
 receive stipends or subsidized loans. Nonetheless,
 a smaller proportion of the European college-aged
 population participates in higher education than is
 the case in the United States and Japan. In both
 Europe and Japan, higher education is less tightly
 coupled to research training than in the United
 States. (1,2,4)

 European and Japanese governments support
 academic research through general, formula based
 operating funds that recipient universities distribute
 among their various functions, including research.
 This general support pays for academic salaries, re-
 search facilities, major equipment, and some support
 services. It is supplemented by competitive awards
 for investigator initiated work, and by funding for
 strategically targeted research. Under this dual sup-
 port mechanism, questions regarding the allocation
 of research time and the proper accounting of indirect
 research costs are less prominent than in the United
 States. (1,2,4)

 The views presented are the authors' and do not necessarily reflect
 the position of the Foundation. A number of persons have con-
 tributed to this paper by guiding and reviewing drafts. The
 authors gratefully acknowledge these inputs and take full respon-
 sibility for any remaining deficiencies. A longer version of this
 paper appears in the April, 1986, issue of Science and Public Policy.

 The faculty members of European and Japanese in-

 stitutions of higher education are lifetime civil ser-
 vants subject to a uniform salary structure. Their
 salaries are paid from general operating funds and
 are not affected by, or paid from, project or pro-
 gram support. Compared to the United States, the
 mobility of academic researchers--and those in other
 sectors-is low. The governments regard the level of
 mobility as an impediment to the transfer of research
 results and techniques, and several have started
 providing incentives to encourage greater movement
 between sectors and into strategically targeted R&D
 areas. (1,2,4)

 In practice, the various dual support systems for

 academic research are being modified by several
 developments. Demands for costly instrumenta-
 tion are forcing a shift of some research costs from
 general academic operating funds to research pro-
 gram budgets. Moreover, overall growth of academic
 research budgets has been curtailed as the European
 nations have placed greater reliance on targeted re-
 search and strategic research initiatives. (1,2,4)

 In contrast to the United States reliance on

 the existence of strong industry-university relation-
 ships as a key to success. While these ties have
 traditionally been weaker than in the United States,
 all governments, including that of the United States,
 have formulated policies intended to strengthen
 them. The proportion of direct government funding
 of industrial R&D is quite variable, ranging from 2
 percent in Japan to about 30 percent for the United
 Kingdom and the United States. (1,2,4)

 The European countries and Japan expend a
 greater portion of central government R&D funds
 on international cooperative research than does the
 United States. The size of the United States science
 establishment permits economies of scale that have
 made possible the operation of national big science
 facilities for United States scientists, and a basic re-
 search effort that is of significant magnitude across
 all S&E fields. (2,9,10)

 The appendix provides selected comparative data
 on the distribution of funding, performance, type of
 R&D, and science and engineering personnel for all
 six nations. Although the focus of this paper is on re-
 search, comparable data separating research from de-
 velopment in these countries are very limited. Thus,
 total R&D is shown to round out the picture. It
 should be pointed out that the research portion (basic
 and applied) is lowest in the United States (37 per-
 cent) and highest in France (54 percent).

 shortterm project support, the European and
 Japanese governments tend to support research
 groups, programs, or laboratories for periods from
 3-5 or even 10 years. They also make greater use of
 block grants, senior investigator awards, and special
 collaborative efforts. (2,3,4)

 In some nations, notably France and West
 Germany, much of what in the United States would
 be academic science is conducted in systems of
 institutions that are allied with, but administra-
 tively independent of, the universities (e.g., CNRS
 Laboratories, Max Planck Institutes). (2,4)

 The importance of mission agencies in funding re-
 search is especially pronounced in the United States.
 A major difference between the United States and
 the other nations, except the United Kingdom, is
 the large proportion of United States government
 R&D resources allocated to defense, now over 75
 percent. However, when development expenses are
 subtracted, defense related research represents only
 about 22 percent of total federal research support
 and is exceeded by government research support for
 health. (2,4)

 In Europe and Japan, a broad consensus exists
 for the principle of government support for research
 targeted on general economic development objec-
 tives. In contrast, the United States government
 funds industrial research primarily in support of
 mission agency purposes. The European nations
 and Japan are targeting national research efforts on
 specific commercial areas that governments consider
 important for future economic development, such as
 electronics, biotechnology, materials research, and
 informatics. In these endeavors, governments regard

 Coordinating Mechanisms

 We now turn to brief discussions of the govern-

 ment research funding systems of specific nations,
 their coordinating mechanisms, efforts to assess the
 effectiveness and results of research, and some re-
 search outputs.

 There is general agreement that the United States
 R&D system and organization are at the pluralistic
 and less centralized end of the spectrum, the French
 at the more planned, centralized, and strategically
 targeted end of the spectrum, and the other nations
 somewhere in between. The United States system
 is seen as more market oriented, flexible, and is
 thought to adjust more easily to changing demands
 than those of the other nations, which are more
 stable overall and tend to provide longer term re-
 search support. (1,5,6)

 In the United Kingdom, the bulk of research
 funding is provided by the central government.
 Major performers are the universities, government
 laboratories, and private industry. Academic re-
 search is supported largely by the central govern-
 ment through block grants from the University
 Grants Council (funded by the Department of

 Education and Science), and competitively awarded
 research grants from five autonomous Research
 Councils. The Research Councils also operate
 government supported laboratories that are acces-
 sible to university scientists. The Department of
 Trade and Industry, with cost sharing by industry,
 supports research activities with potential benefits
 for industry. The government is also stimulating
 joint efforts of industry, academe, and government
 in manufacturing and information technology, opto-
 electronics, and other specially targeted areas. (2,3,4)

 No strong central coordinating body exists in
 the United Kingdom's science system. A decade
 ago, offices of Chief Scientists were created in
 major government agencies. The Cabinet Chief
 Science Advisor's office produces an annual review
 of government-funded R&D and coordinates major
 government initiatives. An Advisory Board for
 the Research Councils (ABRC) advises the Secretary
 of Education and Science on allocation of re-

 supports applied academic research.(3)

 In Japan, most government academic research sup-
 port is provided by the Ministry of Education,
 Science, and Culture (Monbusho), principally to na-
 tional universities and their affiliated laboratories.

 Other major funders are the Science and Technology
 Agency (STA), the Ministry for International Trade
 and Industry (MITI), and several other mission
 agencies. A key STA effort supports interdiscipli-
 nary teams of scientists from industry, academe, and
 government in a program of breakthrough science..
 MITI carries out industrially relevant R&D in its own
 laboratories; promotes privately supported research
 institutes that carry out nonproprietary R&D in cer-
 tain product areas (e.g., semi-conductors, new syn-
 thetics); undertakes focused R&D initiatives; and
 provides low interest loans. Industry in Japan is
 more important than elsewhere as both a supporter
 and performer of research. (1,4)

 Japan's fundamental coordinating mechanism is
 cultural; it rests on the setting of national policy
 through an emerging consensus judgment. The most
 important formal coordinating body is the Council
 for Science and Technology in the Prime Minister's
 Office, composed of educators, industrial managers,
 scientists, and engineers. Special councils are formed
 periodically to assess progress in different fields and
 recommend priorities. Agencies use advisory coun-
 cils and industry associations to ensure consonance
 of government research with industry interests, and
 they plan and conduct research in cooperation with
 industry. MITI's National Project System targets
 national priority areas, with R&D mostly funded
 and conducted by industry. Efforts are under way
 to strengthen the weak university-industry linkage.
 (2,4)

 search funds; efforts are underway to increase
 its role vis-a-vis the Councils in resource alloca-

 tion decisions. Major advisory groups include
 the Advisory Council on Applied Research and
 Development (ACARD), which directs attention
 to areas of emerging commercial importance; the
 Department of Industry Requirements Board, and
 similar bodies in the mission agencies, which identify
 and recommend support of R&D linked to industrial
 needs; and the National Research and Development
 Corporation, a quasi-governmental body, which
 identifies and promotes inventions with industrial
 applications. (2,4)

 In Sweden, the government performs little in-
 house research, only a few mission agencies main-
 tain their own laboratories, and there are no national
 laboratories. The national universities are the main

 performers of research and house large laboratories.
 Government resources for academic research are

 provided in the form of general operating funds
 from the education ministry; supplemental competi-
 tive project andc program support flows through three
 Research Councils. The National Swedish Board for

 Technical Development provides funding for applied
 academic research and applied research and devel-
 opment in industry. (3)

 The Swedish government's Council for Planning

 and Coordination of Research coordinates the re-

 search of three Councils that support fundamen-
 tal research. The government periodically formu-
 lates comprehensive science policy plans which are
 enacted by the Parliament (e.g., 1984 Research Policy
 Bill). It has undertaken two major initiatives: en-
 couraging more industrially relevant research by
 universities; and directly providing funds and other
 support to industry through the National Swedish
 Board for Technical Development (STU), which also

 The French national government provides a larger
 share of national R&D funds than the other govern-
 ments. About a third of central government funds
 are disbursed by the National Center for Scientific
 Research (CNRS) under the Ministry of Research
 and Technology. CNRS laboratories are the main
 locations for the conduct of academic research, and
 most of these laboratories are located on higher
 education campuses but administratively seperate or-
 ganizations. Research funds are also provided by
 the mission agencies, for example, CNES (space),
 CEA (atomic energy), ANVAR (industrial), INSERM
 (health and medicine), IFREMER (oceans and
 fisheries), INRA (agriculture), and AFME (renewable
 energy). (2,3,4)

 French government research priorities are stated in
 5-year R&D plans. The Ministry for Research and
 Technology oversees resource allocations for civilian
 R&D agencies and advises on research programs of
 nationalized firms. Coordination may be facilitated
 by longer term block support, joint operation of

 big science laboratories by mission agencies, and
 government involvement in industrial R&D through
 subsidiaries or direct participation. CNRS (as well
 as other research agencies) has a Committee for
 Industrial Relations that strives for closer articula-

 than for cross-disciplinary work, programs with fun-
 damental and applied components, or comparisons
 across areas of science. Some evidence suggests that
 the United States devotes more effort to determin-

 focus on assessing progress and outputs. This may

 with federal funds predominating for major national
 laboratories, and Laender funds for regional applied
 research institutes. The Research and Technology
 Ministry (BMFT) provides the bulk of federal funds,
 with major additional resources coming from the
 ministries of defense, economics, and education and
 science. Several legally autonomous societies, jointly
 funded by federal and Laender governments, allo-
 cate government science funds: the German Research
 Society (DFG) to academia, the Max Planck Society
 (MPG) for in-house research and to its associated
 basic research institutes, and the Fraunhofer Society,
 half of whose funds come from industry, to its ap-
 plied research institutes. (2,3,4)

 strategies, research directions, and support levels.
 Comparison is made with other countries, and for-
 eign scientists and engineers play a key role as mem-
 bers of the peer review teams. (3)

 Perhaps the most ambitious assessment efforts ex-
 ist in Sweden. Peer evaluations span basic and ap-
 plied research and cover programs, research teams,
 institutions, and fields of science. Their focus is on

 specific fields of science and application. Results are
 available to all and feed into decisions about R&D

 Research Outputs

 West Germany achieves a degree of coordination
 of basic research without direct government control
 by supporting the DFG and the MPG. For applied
 research and work in the national laboratories, the

 Association of Big Science Establishments (AGF) par-
 ticipates in setting research directions. A Science
 Council advises government, DFG, and MPG. No
 formal government-industry coordinating bodies ex-
 ist, but the Ministry for Research and Technology
 (BMFT) and the Science Council plays a coordinating
 role. Federal, Laender, and industry priorities are
 reflected in the applied research of the jointly funded
 Fraunhofer institutes. Industry and government col-
 laborate in selected national laboratory research ac-
 tivities. (2,4)

 Research Evaluation

 Only rough comparisons can be made of the na-
 tions' research outputs. The number of publications
 by a nation's scientists in various fields can serve as
 a measure of the quantity of output. For all fields
 combined, the United States accounts for about 35
 percent of the publications included in the Science
 Citation Index set of S&T journals, although the share
 varies by field. The United States share exceeds the
 other nations' combined total, with Japan, France,
 France, and the United Kingdom contributing be-
 tween 5 and 9 percent each, Sweden less than that,
 reflecting its smaller science establishment. (7,10)

 A rough impression of output quality can be
 derived by examining whether the share of refer-
 ences to that nation's published output falls short of,
 approximates, or exceeds its share of publications.
 In each major discipline, the United States share of
 references received exceeds the United States share

 All nations make some attempts to assess the ef-
 fectiveness and quality of their research systems, and
 many are trying to increase their evaluation efforts.
 In principle, research assessments can be carried out
 at all levels. In practice, assessments of the perfor-
 mance of national science systems are rare. More fre-
 quently, attention is given to determining the quality
 of science in a given discipline, or sometimes in
 groups of institutions or broad fields of science or
 application. (2,3,4)

 Assessments rely largely on peer review, but all
 countries are seeking a broader range of inputs and
 are examining the usefulness of bibliometric tech-
 niques. All nations have found that peer review
 assessments work better for disciplinary research

 of publications, with substantial variation among dis-
 ciplines. In a number of specialties (e.g., physi-
 cal chemistry, solid state catalysis, organic synthetic
 chemistry) the United Kingdom, West Germany, or
 Japan appear to hold leadership positions. (10)

 The United States awards more first university de-
 grees in the natural sciences than the five other na-
 tions combined (over 100,000 in 1983). Data on ad-
 vanced degrees are broadly consistent with data on
 undergraduate degrees. In the United States, West
 Germany, and the United Kingdom, first degree
 graduates in the natural sciences exceed those in en-
 gineering. In contrast, engineering graduates exceed
 those in the natural sciences by a considerable mar-
 gin in Japan and Sweden. Engineering degrees are

 a smaller portion of total first degrees in the United
 States than is the case for the other countries. Japan
 graduates a larger number of first-degree holders
 in engineering than does the United States, but
 the United States graduates more doctorate-level en-
 gineers than does Japan. Better than half of the
 recipients of United States engineering doctorates are
 foreigners. (7)

 Dissatisfactions

 All six nations are attempting to improve their
 international competitive position. The following
 briefly lists some dissatisfactions currently being
 expressed in most or all of the other countries.
 Expressed inadequacies include:

 * too little cooperation between academia and in-
 dustry in research, education, and exchange of infor-
 mation; (3,6)

 academic and government research institutions; (3)

 * insufficient transfer of research skills and infor-

 mation due to low mobility of researchers; (3,6)

 * aging faculty and few positions available for

 young researchers; (2,3)

 * inadequate coupling of academic research with
 teaching, resulting in graduates ill equipped to
 operate near state-of-the-art; (2,3) and

 * variable quality and relevance of government

 laboratories' work. (3,6)

 To address these perceived shortcomings, the
 European and Japanese governments have taken
 a number of steps. All are targeting certain re-
 search areas based on anticipated future economic
 returns and international competitive potential, in-
 cluding biotechnology, electronics and computers,
 informatics, materials, production technology, and
 environmental research. Most are emphasizing a
 user orientation in government supported (especially
 applied) research. (3,5,6)

 In the United Kingdom, West Germany, and
 Sweden, real growth in academic science budgets has
 been reduced or stopped in favor of strategically tar-
 geted programs. In contrast, the Japanese central
 government intends to increase basic research sup-
 port. It is also providing incentives for increased
 university-industry-government laboratory coopera-
 tion, and greater mobility of research personnel from
 one sector to another. In France and Germany,
 modest programs are under way to provide academic
 positions for younger researchers. All governments
 are seeking increased funding for industrial R&D,
 especially in smaller enterprises, through direct and
 indirect mechanisms. Governments also are giving
 more attention to assessing the quality of their na-
 tion's research in specific science and application

 areas, relative to that of other countries.(2,3,4,6)

 Lessons for the United States

 Given United States needs and problems, no
 straightforward lessons can be drawn for United
 States science from the other nations' experiences.
 While a number of countries appear to have brought
 aspects of their policies and strategies a little closer to
 those of the United States, the elements of individual

 national science systems form a whole, fit into a par-
 ticular national context, and are not necessarily trans-
 ferable. Since little objective information exists that
 could reveal what works better or worse under given
 circumstances, the advantages and disadvantages of
 different policies and strategies are not clear. Positive
 and negative consequences of a particular option fre-
 quently depend on how it is implemented.

 The following list of questions should be con-

 * Should the United States move toward longer
 term, programmatic science support? This is one
 of the most striking differences between the United
 States and the other nations. (2,3,4)

 * Should the United States more directly support
 graduate students in fields with strongly growing
 demand which exceeds supply? Project grants are
 the main federal support vehicle for United States
 S&E graduate students; the other governments use
 stipends and subsidized loans. (3,5,6)

 * Should alternative mechanisms be considered

 for supporting academic research facilities and equip-
 ment? Governments elsewhere treat research

 facilities and equipment as a capital investment; in
 the United States, they are paid for through project
 support, special programs, or indirect research costs.
 This may be an especially difficult issue for the
 United States, because of the prominence of federal
 mission agencies in the research support system.
 (2,4)

 * Should the United States provide greater
 government support for nonproprietary research ad-
 dressing industrial needs, especially in areas of in-
 creasing international technological competitiveness?
 European and Japanese governments undertake such
 actions based on a national consensus; in the United
 States, no agreement exists on the issue. (5,6)

 * Should the United States expand international
 cooperative research, especially where facilities and
 equipment costs are high? This would require care-
 ful consideration of advantages and disadvantages
 to the United States of various forms of cooperation
 (bilateral, multilateral) in particular science fields.
 (2,4)

 * Should the United States move toward greater
 centralization or coordination of government re-

 search? Recent proposals have included estab-
 lishment of a Cabinet-level Department of Science
 and Technology, a Department of Science, a National
 Technology Foundation, a National Institute for
 Research and Advanced Studies, and a National
 Applied Science Administration. Centralization is
 not synonymous with coordination or quality, and
 no good evidence can be drawn from the experiences
 of the countries examined to support the greater
 efficacy of more centralized vs. more pluralistic sys-
 tems. (1,2,4)

 'Natural sciences and engineering only; all other figures include social science and humanities; the U.S. excludes humanities.
 2In the U.S., the government sector is federal only; in other countries, government includes all levels. Data in parentheses exclude general
 university funds and are thus more comparable to distribution of U.S. separately budgeted Government supported R&D.
 3In France, the CNRS R&D is classified as higher education in performance data but as government source of funds data; in FRG the Max Planck
 Institutes are classified as government.
 41983; 66% in 1984, estimates are 68% in 1985 and 73% in 1986.
 5General purpose research; including an estimated portion of general university funds (except U.S.).
 6Includes Mathematics and Computer Scientists/Specialists
 7Includes Master Degrees
 8Included in Natural Sciences

 -Sources for all data are OECD and NSF and country data.
