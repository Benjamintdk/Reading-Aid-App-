 Geometric division problems, quadratic equations,
 and recursive geometric algorithms in Mesopotamian
 mathematics

 Abstract Most of what is told in this paper has been told before by the same author,
 in a number of publications of various kinds, but this is the first time that all this

 material has been brought together and treated in a uniform way. Smaller errors in the
 earlier publications are corrected here without comment. It has been known since the

 1920s that quadratic equations played a prominent role in Babylonian mathematics.

 See, most recently, H0yrup (Hist Sci 34:1-32, 1996, and Lengths, widths, surfaces: a

 portrait of old Babylonian algebra and its kin. Springer, New York, 2002). What has

 not been known, however, is how quadratic equations came to play that role, since it

 is difficult to think of any practical use for quadratic equations in the life and work

 of a Babylonian scribe. One goal of the present paper is to show how the need to

 find solutions to quadratic equations actually arose in Mesopotamia not later than in

 the second half of the third millennium BC, and probably before that in connection

 with certain geometric division of property problems. This issue was brought up for
 the first time in Friberg (Cuneiform Digit Lib J 2009:3, 2009). In this connection,

 it is argued that the tool used for the first exact solution of a quadratic equation
 was either a clever use of the "conjugate rule" or a "completion of the square," but

 that both methods ultimately depend on a certain division of a square, the same in

 both cases. Another, closely related goal of the paper is to discuss briefly certain
 of the most impressive achievements of anonymous Babylonian mathematicians in

 the first half of the second millennium BC, namely recursive geometric algorithms

 for the solution of various problems related to division of figures, more specifically

 trapezoidal fields. For an earlier, comprehensive (but less accessible) treatment of these

 issues, see Friberg (Amazing traces of a Babylonian origin in Greek mathematics.
 WorldScientific, Singapore 2007b, Ch. 11 and App. I).

 1 Metro-mathematical school texts from the proto-literate period in

 Mesopotamia (around 3000 BC)

 1.1 A proto-literate clay tablet with the oldest known geometrical assignments

 For a long time before the invention of writing, probably for several millennia, count

 ing and recording were performed in vast regions of the Middle East by the use

 of small "pre-literate number tokens" of clay in simple geometric forms (cylinders,

 spheres, cones, pyramids) with a system of assigned metrological/numerical values.

 (See Friberg 2007a, App. 4.10, and also Friberg 1999a). The oldest known inscribed

 clay tablets are from the "proto-literate period" in Mesopotamia, slightly before and

 around 3000BC, and are written in the "proto-cuneiform" script, a precursor of the

 more well-known Sumerian/Babylonian cuneiform script. Already in these earliest

 written documents, systems of measures and measure notations for lengths and sur

 faces, capacities of containers, weights, and parts of the year were extremely well

 developed and beautifully coordinated with a system of sexagesimal counting num

 bers in non-positional notation. (See Friberg op. cit., App. 4.1-2, 4.4-6, 4.9). There

 were different number signs for 1(60), for 10(60), for 1(60 ■ 60), for 10(60 · 60),

 etc. Lengths were probably, as later in the Sumerian period, expressed in terms of

 "rods" (6 m) and "ropes" (=10rods). Surfaces were, correspondingly, measured in

 terms of square rods (in Sumerian sar) and square ropes (in Sumerian iku), in other

 words in "quadratic area measure". This is the only textual indication that the notion

 of a "square " was known already in this remote period. (Presumably, it would not be
 difficult to find non-textual, concrete evidence in architecture, art, etc., that the notion

 of a square was well known also in remote times in Mesopotamia).

 Only a handful of suspected mathematical school texts from the proto-literate period

 are known. Just like practically all known mathematical texts from the third millen

 nium BC, they should rather be called "metro-mathematical," because it is evident
 that their purpose was just as much training in "metrology," that is, in the use of

 the various systems of measures and measure notations, as training in "mathemat

 ics," that is, in counting with sexagesimal numbers and performing various kinds of

 computations.

 The clearest example of a proto-literate metro-mathematical text is the clay tablet
 W 19408,76 (Nissen et al. 1993, Fig. 50), on which are given the side lengths of

 two quadrilateral fields (by which is meant more or less rectangular fields with four

 straight sides). The text is probably an assignment, in the sense that a young stu

 dent was supposed to compute the areas of the two fields. If the two areas are com

 puted by the use of a certain inexact "quadrilateral area rule," namely in each case

 as the half-sum of the two lengths "along" times the half-sum of the two lengths

 "across," it turns out that they can both be expressed as very large and very round
 area numbers. Obviously, the data must have been chosen carefully and deliber

 ately by a teacher (the author of the exercise) to produce this kind of nice numbers.

 It is, by the way, common in the study ofMesopotamian mathematics that particularly

 interesting results are obtained by trying to understand how teachers constructing

 mathematical exercises for their students cleverly fabricated the initial data for those
 exercises.

 1.2 An area number produced by an application of the proto-literate field expansion

 procedure

 Other known examples of proto-literate mathematical texts are supposed applications

 of a certain, quite elegant, "field expansion procedure". (See Friberg 2007a, sections

 1.1 d and 8.1 b-c, and Friberg 1997/98, sections 2-4). Take, for instance, W 14148
 (Friberg 1997/98, 9; Fig. 1 above), originally published in Green and Nissen 1987,

 ATU 2, pi. 59:

 This is a small text from Warka, ancient Uruk, where a large number of proto

 literate clay tablets have been found. It is a note about an area written with the special

 proto-cuneiform area number signs for l(bùr)= 18 iku, for l(èse) = 6 iku, and for

 1 (iku). (A notation like 6(bùr) stands for the special area number sign 1 (bur) repeated

 6 times, etc.). The area in question is

 6bùr 1 èse 3 iku = 191 /2èse = 1 (60) 57 iku(= 117 iku).

 Note: A notation like 1(60)57 is used here for a sexagesimal number in non-positional
 notation. The corresponding notation for a sexagesimal number in positional or place

 value notation would be simply 1 57.

 This area is typical for areas computed by the use of the field expansion procedure.

 Indeed, note that

 rods).

 a) 19 1/2 èse = 20 èse - 1 /40 of 20 èse = approximately 20 èse (=12,000 square

 b) 1(60)57 iku =13-9 iku = (1 1/12) - (1 1/8)· 12 8 iku.

 This means that the area number inscribed on W 14148 is a) very close to a conspic

 uously "round" area number, and b) equal to the area of a rectangular field with the

 side along (I 1/12) · 12 ropes and the side across (1 1/8) · 8 ropes. A rectangular field

 like this is the result of a slight expansion in two directions of a rectangular field with

 its sides in a simple ratio (12:8 = 3:2).

 Further explicit examples of suspected school texts related to the field expansion

 procedure will be given in Sects. 2.1 and 3.1 below. There, it will also be shown that the

 field expansion procedure may have been a clever method of solving certain problems

 involving quadratic equations by means of iterated approximations.

 1.3 Nearly round numbers in proto-literate field division and bread-and-beer texts

 In a proto-literate "field division text" MSVO1,2 (Englund and Grégoire 1991 ; Friberg

 1997/98,19), the areas are computed for five rectangular fields of various sizes, belong

 ing to five named persons. The sum of the five areas, which is recorded on the reverse

 of the clay tablet, is

 3 sàr 52 bùr 2 èse 5 iku = 1 (60 · 60) 9(60) 53 iku = 1 (60 · 60) 10(60) - 7 iku

 ( 1 sàr = 60 bùr)

 In other words, the sum of the five areas is

 7 · 10 · 60 iku — 7 iku = 7 · 10 · 60 iku (square ropes) minus precisely 1/600

 of that round number.

 This nearly round area number is hardly accidental, it must have been the result of a

 difficult and laborious computation.

 Another suspected example of a school text from the proto-literate period in

 Mesopotamia is the "bread-and-beer text" MSVO 4,66 (Englund 1997; Friberg 1999a,

 112-115; Friberg 2005,62-65; and Fig. 2 below). This text begins with an account of

 60 + 2 · 60 + 2 · 60 + (2 · 260 + 60) + 5 · 2 · 60 + 5 ■ 20 · 60

 = 20 · 60 + 5 · 20 · 60 (= 7, 200)

 bread rations of six different sizes, with a corresponding cost in flour of 1M (a certain

 proto-literate unit of capacity measure, possibly about 5 liters), 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and

 1/6 M, respectively. There are relatively small numbers of rations of the larger sizes,
 but 5 · 20 · 60 = 6,000 rations of the smallest size. The total cost in flour for all the

 bread rations is nearly 22 1/2 · 60M. Next, there is an account of the cost in flour

 for various amounts of three categories of beer. The total cost in flour for all the beer

 (together 10 - 60 = 600 jars) is nearly 7 1/2- 60M. Recorded on the reverse of the

 clay tablet is the total cost in flour for both bread and beer, which is

 900M + 2 · 300M + 9 · 30M + 4 · 5M + 1M (= 1.791M)

 = 2 · 900M minus precisely 1 /200 of that round number.

 This nearly exact result is hardly accidental, it must have been the result of another

 difficult and laborious computation.

 The mentioned examples show that there can be no doubt that learning to divide

 given parcels of land into shares according to some intricate set of rules, or dividing

 given amounts of food stuff into rations of various sizes according to some other

 intricate set of rules, must have been an important part of the metro-mathematical

 education given to the young scribes in the scribe schools that must have existed in

 one or several Mesopotamian large urban areas already in the proto-literate period

 5000 years ago.

 2 Metro-mathematical school texts from the Early Dynastic III period

 (around 2500 BC)

 2.1 An Early Dynastic application of the field expansion procedure

 In the Old Sumerian Early Dynastic III period, Mesopotamian mathematics had taken

 important strides forward. Yet, a connection was still maintained with the mathematical

 ideas of the preceding proto-literate period, as is shown by the inscriptions in the two
 columns of the Early Dynastic clay tablet TSS 926 shown in Fig. 3 below (Jestin
 1937; Friberg 2007a, 147). In each column, the sides of a quadrilateral field are given,
 expressed in terms of sexagesimal numbers in non-positional notation. The inscription
 in the well-preserved first column is transliterated (in Sumerian) and translated (in

 English) below, to the right of the copy of the clay tablet.

 Like its proto-literate predecessor W 19408,76, mentioned above, this mathematical
 text is probably an assignment, in the sense that a young student was supposed to
 compute the areas of the two fields.

 Fig. 3 TSS 926. An example of data produced by the field expansion procedure

 It is easy to see that the half-sums of the lengths of the sides along and the sides

 across (recorded in the first column of the text) would be, respectively,

 (120+ 125)/2rods = 122 1/2 rods = 12 1/4 ropes, and

 (60 + 70)/2 rods = 65 rods = 61/2 ropes.

 Correspondingly, the computed area of the quadrilateral would be of the following
 form :

 12 1/4 ropes · 6 1/2 ropes = 79 1/2 1/8 iku(square ropes)

 = almost precisely 80 iku (=4 bùrl èse2iku).

 Alternatively, the area of the quadrilateral can be expressed in the following way:

 (1 1/48 · 12 ropes) · (1 1/12 · 6 ropes).

 As will be shown in connection with a similar example in Sect. 3.1 below, whenever

 the computed area of a quadrilateral in a Mesopotamian (Sumerian or Babylonian)
 mathematical exercise can be expressed both as a (nearly) round number and as a round

 number multiplied by two factors of the form 1 1/n, where η is a "regular" sexagesimal

 number (more about this later), then the exercise can be suspected of being the result

 of the application of the mentioned, initially proto-literate, field expansion procedure.

 The purpose of that procedure seems, in each case, to have been to compute the sides

 of a quadrilateral field with (approximately) a given area and with the half-sum along
 and the half-sum across in a given ratio!

 2.2 An Early Dynastic computation of the area of a very large square

 The Early Dynastic III tablet 7SS188 (Jestin 1937; Friberg 2007a, 148) contains the
 earliest known explicit reference to a square. In the copy of the clay tablet in Fig. 4

 below, it is the diamond-shaped cuneiform logographic sign to the right in the first line

 of the text, normally with the meaning "(to be) equal," but here with the more precise

 meaning "a figure with equal sides (and right angles)".

 Fig. 4 TSS 188. The area of an unrealistically lar^e square

 In this text, the area of a very large square with the side 50(60) rods (=3,000rods
 = 1,800 meters!) has been computed. The result is expressed in terms of the Sumerian

 large area measure bùr = 30(60) sq. rods and special Sumerian number signs for area
 measures. Interestingly, the stated answer is not correct.

 Apparently, the computation (which is not shown in the text) was intended to

 proceed in a quite clever way, namely as follows:

 sq. (50(60)rods) = sq. 5 · sq. 10 · sq. (60rods) = 25 · I (60) 40 · 2 bùr = 25 · 3(60) 20bùr

 = 21/2· 33(60) 20 bùr = 1 (60 · 60) 23(60) 20 bùr.

 Instead, however, a simple numerical error in the middle of the computation lead to

 the following incorrect result (the one inscribed in the lower half of the clay tablet):

 sq. (50(60)rods) = sq. 5 · sq. 10 · sq. (60rods) = 25-1 (60)40 · 2 bùr

 = 25 · 3(60) 30 bùr = 2 1 /2 ■ 35(60) bùr = 1 (60 ■ 60) 27(60) 30 bùr.

 Note: The abbreviation sq. stands here for "square," in the geometric sense, as an area.

 The concept of a number in the second power was not known in ancient Mesopotamia,
 at least not in the third millennium BC. The notation a ■ b stands, indiscriminately, for

 either the area of a rectangle with sides of lengths a and b, or for b (an area, a length,

 or a number) multiplied by the number a.

 2.3 Early Dynastic tables of areas and metric division algorithms

 Also from the Early Dynastic III period are three known metro-mathematical tables
 of squares or, more precisely, "tables of areas of square fields". One of these tables
 (VAT 12593) lists the areas of a decreasing series of squares with the side 10(60) rods,
 9(60) rods, and so on (Deimel 1923; Friberg 2007a, 149). This is the oldest known
 metro-mathematical table text.

 A somewhat younger, but even larger and much more elaborate table text (CUNES
 50-08-001) begins by listing the areas of an increasing series of squares, with sides
 progressing in regular steps from 1 rod to 10(60 · 60) rods. After that follow several

 other tables of similar types, ending with a table for areas of a series of squares with
 sides as small as 1/24 rod (Friberg op. cit., App. 7).

 Fig. 5 MS 3047. A summation of the areas of six very long and narrow rectangles

 Metro-mathematical tables of areas of square fields of the mentioned kind are, in

 a way, predecessors of both Old Babylonian tables of squares and Old Babylonian
 metrological tables.

 An interesting deviation from this pronounced interest in the areas of squares is

 another table text from the Early Dynastic III period (MS 3047, obv.\ Friberg op. cit.,
 150; and Fig. 5 above). It is a curious table of areas of a series of six rectangles,
 all (unrealistically) with the length 60 times as long as the width. The text ends by
 mentioning the sum of the six computed areas, so it is a playful imitation of a field
 division text like the proto-literate text MSVO 1, 2 mentioned in Sect. 1.3 above.

 The tendency of mathematical exercises to deal with unrealistically large numbers

 (as in W 19408, 76, MSVO 4, 66, TSS 188, and MS 3047 above) can be observed

 also in a couple of well-known Early Dynastic III "metric division exercises" (TSS
 50 and TSS 671 ; Jestin 1937; H0yrup 1982; Friberg op. cit., 414). There the content
 of a granary, 5(60 · 60 ■ 60) 20(60 · 60) sîla (the sîla was a capacity measure, equal
 to approximately 1 liter) = 1,152,000 sîla, is to be divided into rations of 7 sîla each.
 Since 7 is not a divisor of 60, the division must have been accomplished by the use
 of an elaborate metric division algorithm, as in a parallel and roughly contemporary

 metro-mathematical text from Ebla, a city state in modern Syria not far from northern
 Mesopotamia (TM.75.G 1392; Friberg 1986).

 3 Metro-mathematical school texts from the Old Akkadian period

 (c. 2340-2200 BC)

 3.1 An Old Akkadian application of the field expansion procedure

 The text shown in Fig. 6 below (Luckenbill 1930; Friberg 2007a, 402) is from the Old
 Akkadian period. It specifies the sides and the area of a long and narrow trapezoidal
 field. The given unequal widths are 1(60) 10 rods and 44 1/2 rods (half-sum 57 1/4
 rods), and the length is 5(60) 15 rods. The area of the field is claimed to be 10 bur =

 5(60 ■ 60) square rods, a large and round area number. The last two lines of the text

 give the name of the writer, "The-king-is-my-wall," and the name of the field, "The
 field-by-the-large-and-grand-marsh," which sound like fictive names.

 Since the area of the field is a round number while its length can be written as
 11/6· 4(60) 30, this seems to be the result of yet another application of the mentioned

 proto-literate field expansion procedure.

 The construction of the data can be explained as follows: The author of the text

 wanted to construct a trapezoid with the round area 10 bùr = 5(60 · 60) square rods,
 and with the ratio of the length to the half-sum of the widths close to 5:1. For that

 purpose, he started with a rectangle with

 the initial length 4(60) 30 rods, and the initial width 1 /5 · 4(60) 30 rods = 54 rods

 (step 1)

 The corresponding initial area could then be shown to be 4(60) 30 rods · 54 rods = 4(60 ·

 60) 3(60) sq. rods = 8 bùr I iku 80 sar, nearly 1(60 · 60) sq. rods = 2 bur less than the
 wanted area. In other words, the area deficit was close to 1/4 of the initial area. To

 substantially reduce this deficit, the author of the text extended the initial length by
 1/6 and obtained

 the extended length — 1 1/6 · 4(60) 30rods = 5(60) 15rods (step 2)

 The resulting extended area was

 11/6· 4(60 · 60) 3(60) sq.rods = 4(60 · 60) 3(60) sq.rods + 40(60) 30sq.rods

 = 4(60 · 60) 43(60) 30 sq.rods.

 In Sumerian area measure, this is 9 bur 8 iku 10 sar. The new area deficit was then
 16(60)30 sq. rods, slightly less than 1/16 of the new area. To eliminate most of this
 new deficit, the author of the text extended the width by a factor of 1/(16 2/3) =
 3/60 36/(60 · 60), obtaining

 the extended width — (1 + 3/60 36/(60 ■ 60)) · 54 rods

 = 57 14/6024/(60 · 60) rods = appr. 57 1/4 rods (step 3)

 The author of the text probably did not bother to compute the area of the twice

 extended rectangle, but instead immediately declared it to be 10bùr=5(60 · 60) square
 rods. (The exact result is 5(60 ■ 60) 33 1/4 square rods, or about 5(60 · 60) square
 rods+ 1/600 of that number). Moreover, since he wanted the final result to be a trape

 zoid rather than a rectangle, he chose to let the upper width be 1 (60) 10 rods. It followed

 that the lower width had to be 44 1/2 rods, which is the value given in the text (Fig. 7).

 The appearance of the number 16 2/3 in this reconstructed application of the field

 extension procedure is, possibly, the earliest known appearance in a Mesopotamian
 mathematical text of a deliberately chosen "sexagesimally regular number". A sex
 agesimal^ regular number is a number which divides a power of the base 60, and
 which therefore has another, finitely expressible sexagesimal number (say, an integer)
 as its "reciprocal". In this particular case, 16 2/3 has the reciprocal 3(60) 36 because
 16 2/3 · 3(60) 36 = 1 (60 · 60). Note that this surmised example of the use of a sex
 agesimally regular number in a computation unexpectedly appears in a cuneiform
 text from a period well before the invention of sexagesimal numbers in place value
 notation!

 The frequent appearance of results of applications of the (proto-literate) field exten
 sion procedure in Mesopotamian metro-mathematical texts from the third millennium

 BC is potentially historically important for the following reason: Apparently, the pri
 mary purpose of the field extension procedure was (for some unknown reason) to

 construct a rectangular field of given size and form, in other words a rectangle with
 a given area and a given ratio of length and width. In modern notations, this is a pair

 of equations of the type

 A mathematically equivalent "quadratic-linear" pair of equations is, of course,

 I ■ w = A, l/w = f.

 sq ,l = f-A, w — l/f.

 Therefore, the field extension procedure can be interpreted as a primitive but clever

 way of solving geometrically a quadratic problem of the very simplest kind, indirectly

 involving a square side computation, by a kind of successive approximations. (For a
 detailed discussion of various clever methods for square side computations, by the

 use of successive approximations, in Old and Late Babylonian mathematical texts, the
 interested reader is referred to Friberg 2007b, Sect. 16.7).

 3.2 Old Akkadian metric division problems and applications of the binomial rule

 Several known small school texts from the Old Akkadian period are witnesses of a ris

 ing interest in "metric algebra," by which is meant here finding solutions to geometric

 problems by skillful manipulations of rectangles and squares, with sizes of sides and
 surfaces expressed in terms of current length and area measures. (See Friberg 2007a,
 403-409). Some of the texts are examples of "metric division" where the area and

 the length of one side of a rectangle are known, while the length of the second side
 has to be computed. In one such case, the area of a rectangle is 1 square rope, while
 the length of the known side is 4(60) 3 rods. Typically, 4(60) 3 = 35 is a regular
 sexagesimal number. Some other texts are examples of "metric squaring," typically
 exercises in the use of the "binomial rule"

 sq. (p + q) = sq. ρ + sq. q + 2p ■ q,

 since the given length of a side is the sum of a large number and a much smaller
 number. This is interesting, because the inverse "square side" problem, that of finding

 the length of the side of a square of given area (in modern abstract terms, computing

 a square root) can be solved by the use of the binomial rule, together with successive
 approximations.

 3.3 An Old Akkadian trapezoid division problem leading to a quadratic equation

 On the Old Akkadian school text IM 58045 (Friberg 2007a, 409), shown in Fig. 8
 below with a translated cuneiform inscription, there is a picture of a trapezoid with

 parallel sides of 3 reeds - 1 cubit = 17 cubits, and 1 reed 1 cubit = 7 cubits, and with

 for a trapezoid division problem

 J. Friberg

 a height of 2 reeds = 12 cubits = 1 rod. An easy computation shows that the area of
 the trapezoid is precisely 12 cubits · 12 cubits = 1 sq. rod, a round (but surprisingly
 small) area number. A transversal line divides the trapezoid into two sub-trapezoids.

 It is likely that it was a student's task to find the length of the transversal line in the

 case when it bisects the trapezoid, that is, when the areas of the two sub-trapezoids
 are equal.

 There is no direct indication how the student would have attacked this problem.

 Essentially, there are two different methods the student could conceivably have used,

 if he did not know the answer beforehand. (An uninteresting and trivial possibility is
 that the student already was familiar with the "trapezoid bisection equation," discussed

 below, but then the question remains how that equation had been discovered in the first

 place). The first of these two methods will be considered in the present section of this
 paper. Indeed, consider (as in Fig. 9 below) a trapezoid with parallel sides of given
 lengths a and b, with b > a, and a given height h. Then, the area A and the "growth
 rate" / = (b — a)/h can be computed. Imagine that the trapezoid is divided by a
 transversal into two sub-trapezoids, one of area P, the other of area Q, as in Fig. 9.

 Let the unknown length of the transversal be d, and let the unknown distance between
 the transversal and the longer parallel be u.

 Now, just as for the whole trapezoid (b + a)/2 ■ h = A and b — a = f ■ h, so for

 the upper sub-trapezoid

 (b + d)/2 ■ u = P, b — d = / · u.

 The unknowns d and u can then be computed as the solutions to the following
 "rectangular-linear system of equations":

 (b + d)/2 ■ u = P, b — d — f ■ u, where b, /, and Ρ are known.

 Therefore, an application of the "conjugate rule"

 (b + d) ■ (b — d) = sq. b — sq. d

 shows that, alternatively, d and u can be found as the solutions to the following
 "quadratic-linear system of equations":

 sq. b — sq. d — f · 2P. b — d = f ■ u, where b, /, and Ρ are known.

 The parallel sides a and b are given.
 The parallel sides a and b are given.
 The height h is also given.
 The height h is also given.

 The growth rate is f=(b-a)/h.
 The growth rate is f=(b-a)/h.
 The area is A = (b + a)l2 ■ h.
 The area is A = (b + α)Ι2 ■ h.
 P and Q are given so that P + Q = A.
 Ρ and Q are given so that Ρ + Q = A.

 The unknowns are d, u, and v.

 After a slight rearrangement of the terms in the two equations, one gets instead

 sq.d = sq.b — / · 2P, u = (b-d)/f, where b, f, and Ρ are known.

 This means that if the Old Akkadian student knew the conjugate rule and if he knew

 how to compute a square side, then he could find first the value of d and thereafter
 also the value of u.

 In the Old Akkadian school text IM 58045 considered above, the given values are

 b = 17cubits, a =7cubits, h = 12 cubits, and (probably)P = Q — A/2.

 Consequently,

 2P = A — sq. (12cubits) = 2(60) 24sq.cubits, / = ( 17 - 7)/12 = 5/6.

 In view of what was shown above, this means that d can be computed as the following

 square side (abbreviated sqs.):

 d = sqs. (sq.b - f ■ 2P) = sqs. (sq. (17 cubits) - 5/6 · 2(60)24 sq.cubits)

 = sqs. ((4(60)49 - 2(60)) sq.cubits) = sqs.(2(60) 49 sq.cubits) = 13 cubits.

 Then, also

 κ = (17 cubits — 7 cubits)/2 = 5 cubits.

 Note that the teacher had chosen the data of the exercise so that, in this particular case,

 the computation of the square side was easy, because 2(60)49 sq. cubits is precisely
 the square of 13 cubits.

 Similarly, considering in Fig. 9 the lower sub-trapezoid with the area Q, it can be

 shown that

 sq.d — sq.a = / · 2Q.

 Therefore, in the special case when Ρ — Q, so that the transversal bisects the trapezoid,
 it follows that

 sq.fr - sq.d = sq.d - sq.a or (sq.a + sq.fr) = 2sq.d.

 When a and b are known, this is a quadratic equation for d, which may be called the

 "trapezoid bisection equation". When a and b are not known, the trapezoid bisection

 equation is instead an indeterminate quadratic equation for the triple a, fr, c.

 It is possible that a solution in integers to the indeterminate trapezoid bisection

 equation was found initially as a result of a fortuitous observation of the curious fact
 that

 sq. (7cubits) = 49sq.cubits, sq. (13 cubits) = 2(60)49sq.cubits,

 sq. (17 cubits) = 4(60) 49 sq.cubits.

 Admittedly, it may be only a reasonable conjecture that Old Akkadian students

 knew how the trapezoid transversal d in Fig. 9 above can be computed by the use of

 the quadratic equation

 sq. d = sq. b — f ■ 2P, where b, /, and Ρ are known.

 However, it is a fact that Old Babylonian students knew how to use the very same

 quadratic equation for a similar purpose. This is shown, quite explicitly, by the solution

 procedure in the interesting "breach repair problem" in Sect. 1 of the Old Babylonian

 mathematical cuneiform text MS 3052 (Friberg 2007a, Fig. 10.2.4).

 3.4 Solutions of quadratic equations making use of completions of the square or

 applications of the conjugate rule

 The second of the two methods which an Old Akkadian student may conceivably

 have used in order to compute the length of the transversal bisecting the trapezoid

 depicted on the tablet IM 58045 in Fig. 8 above (without already being familiar with

 the trapezoid bisection equation), proceeds as follows: It is geometrically obvious (see

 Fig. 9) that

 b ■ u - //2 · sq.u = P, where b, /, and Ρ are known.

 This is a quadratic equation for the unknown u, of a kind that was solved routinely

 in Old Babylonian mathematical problem texts, apparently through an application of

 a geometric version of the method called (by us) "completion of the square".

 Therefore, if an Old Akkadian student knew how to apply a completion of the square,

 and if he also knew how to compute a square side, he could use the quadratic equation

 mentioned above in order to find the lengths of the trapezoid transversals in Figs. 8
 and 9.

 It is, by the way, important to understand that for an Old Akkadian student of math

 ematics, what we call the "binomial rule," the "conjugate rule," and "completion of the

 square" must all have been understood in their original, geometric sense. Indeed, in the

 Old Akkadian period, and even much later, abstract numbers and symbolic notations

 for objects or algebraic operations, etc., had not yet been invented. (For a detailed elab

 oration of remarks like these, interested readers are referred to H0yrup's LWS (2002).

 H0yrup was, indeed, the first one to understand that Old Babylonian mathematicians

 both formulated and solved quadratic equations and problems geometrically).

 Moreover, the word "rule" is more suitable here than the obviously anachronistic

 word "theorem," even if it is likely that Old Akkadian teachers used some kind of

 geometric arguments to convince their students about the validity of the rules. The

 forms that such geometric arguments could take (hypothetically) are shown below, in

 the diagrams in Figs. 10 and 11.

 lonian "metric algebra." It is interesting to notice that the suggested demonstration
 of the conjugate rule is based on the same geometric configuration as the suggested
 demonstration of the completion of the square. In view of this intimate connection

 between the conjugate rule and the completion of the square, it is easy to understand
 why, as above, the following rectangular-linear system of equations for the unknowns

 (b + d)/2 ■ u = P, b — d = / · u, where b, /, and Ρ are known

 can be solved by the use of a completion of the square.

 4 Metro-mathematical school texts from the Neo-Sumerian Ur III period

 (c. 2100-2000 BC)

 At some time in the Ur III period, place value notation for sexagesimal numbers
 was invented (although without the use of zeros, so that the represented numbers had
 floating values). This is what is suggested by the existence of a number of "tables

 of reciprocals" from this period, with numbers in place value notation. (See Friberg
 2007a, 356, and, in particular, the survey in Friberg 2009, Sects. 4.2.1-4, of where
 such tables of reciprocals have been published). These tables of reciprocals are, by
 the way, the only texts from the third millennium that can be said to be mathematical
 rather than metro-mathematical.

 The oldest known texts with recursive algorithms are from this period. (A recursive

 algorithm is a procedure in several similar steps, where the result of the procedure
 in each step is used as data for the next step). One such text is a calculation of the
 annual production of "dairy fat" and "cheese" over a period of ten years, based on
 the hypothetical growth of a cattle herd consisting, initially, of four milk cows. (See
 Nissen et al. 1993, Figure 76).

 Another example is a geometrical recursive algorithm in a legal document, sworn
 by the name of the king, which meticulously describes how an irregularly formed
 "orchard" (as in Fig. 12 below) has been divided by parallel transversals into five
 smaller plots of equal areas (Clay 1915; Friberg 2009).

 The explicit computations are not shown in the text, only the results, in particular

 the widths of the individual plots, which are computed with surprising accuracy. The

 essential part of the computations must have been to divide a trapezoid of given base d\,

 given growth rate, and given area, into four sub-trapezoids of given areas, proceeding
 as follows: First, the length of the upper parallel side and the width of the first sub
 trapezoid are computed. (This is a problem of the same type as the Old Akkadian
 trapezoid bisection problem discussed above, in Sect. 3.3). Then, the length of the

 upper parallel side and the width of the second sub-trapezoid are computed, and so

 on. It is clear that the author of this legal text must have learned at school how to solve

 quadratic-linear or rectangular-linear problems and also how to find approximate

 values for the square sides of given area numbers.

 5 Mathematical texts from the Old Babylonian period (c. 2000-1600 BC)

 5.1 Quadratic problems and problems involving regular sexagesimal numbers in Old

 Babylonian texts

 In Old Babylonian mathematical texts, all computations are carried out in terms

 of abstract sexagesimal numbers in place value notation, although sometimes the

 given data and the answers to the problems are expressed metrologically, in terms

 of length and area measures, weight measures, or capacity measures. It is, therefore,

 quite reasonable that, as has been shown recently, the Old Babylonian mathematical

 school curriculum started with the copying of extensive metrological lists and tables,

 multiplication tables, and tables of reciprocals. (See, for instance, Proust 2007, Ch. 5).

 In the more advanced stages of the curriculum, problems involving quadratic equa

 tions of many different kinds, and many different degrees of complexity, played a

 central role. Another popular subject was computations with "many-place regular

 sexagesimal numbers". As mentioned before, a sexagesimal number η is called "reg

 ular" if there exists another sexagesimal number, which conveniently may be called

 rec. n, such that « - rec. η equals some power of 60 (="1" in Babylonian floating place

 value notation). Regular sexagesimal numbers can always be interpreted as products of

 powers of 2, 3, and 5. Well-documented examples of such computations with many

 place regular sexagesimal numbers are computations of square roots or reciprocals

 of given regular sexagesimal numbers as products of square roots or reciprocals of

 factors of those numbers. A particularly impressive example is the Old Babylonian
 text CBS 1215, which combines a "reciprocals through factorization algorithm" with

 a "doubling and halving algorithm". The result is a long series of pairs of reciprocals
 («, rec. n), beginning with the pair (53, S--*) = (205,2848). (See Friberg 2007a,
 App. 3).

 Interesting combinations of quadratic problems and problems involving regular

 sexagesimal numbers are the Old Babylonian "igi-igi.bi problems" (igi and igi.bi are

 Sumerian terms for η and rec. ή). Since, by definition, igi ■ igi.bi = 1 (here necessarily

 meaning just the integer 1), it follows that

 sq. {(igi + igi.bi)/2} - 1 = sq. {(igi - igi.bi)/2}.

 This simple identity makes it easy to solve, for instance, the quadratic equation

 igi + igi.bi = p, with a givenp, and with igi and igi.bi as unknowns.

 Note that it also follows from the mentioned identity that if igi and igi.bi are supposed

 to be regular sexagesimal numbers, then

 is a generating rule for right triangles with rational sides, "normalized" in the sense
 that the longest of the two orthogonal sides is of length 1. [See the detailed dis
 cussion of the famous table text Plimpton 322 (Neugebauer and Sachs 1945, text
 A) in Friberg (1981). The explanation proposed there of how the table on Plimp
 ton 322 was constructed is now confirmed by a series of computations in the Old
 Babylonian exercises MS 3971 §§ 3 a-e. See Friberg 2007a, App. 8 and Sect.
 10.1 f].

 5.2 The Old Babylonian fixed trapezoid diagonals rule

 Other noteworthy achievements in Old Babylonian mathematics are several types of

 geometric recursive algorithms. One such recursive algorithm appears on a clay tablet
 inscribed with the text of an exercise together with a drawing of a trapezoid divided

 into five sub-trapezoids, all with diagonals of length 3. (VAT 8393; see Friberg 2007b,
 App. 1). The algorithm was unknown before the publication of this Old Babylonian
 text.

 According to the statement of this problem in the cuneiform text, an initial trapezoid

 has a given inclined side of length « = 2 00, parallel sides of given lengths 5 = 2 30 and
 t = 2 00, and a diagonal of length d = 3 00. Asked for are two additional trapezoids
 "above" and two "below" the given one, all with diagonals of the same length. See
 Fig. 13 below.

 In the solution in the text to this problem, a recursive algorithm is used to determine

 the lengths of the inclined sides and "lower" parallels of the first and second trape
 zoids "below" the given one, and then the lengths of the inclined sides and "upper"
 parallels of the first and second trapezoids "above" the given one. (It turns out to be
 impossible to continue the procedure to third trapezoids below and above the given
 one!)

 With the given values u = 2 00, s = 2 30, / = 2 00, and d = 3 00, the values
 successively calculated in the algorithmic procedure of VAT 8393 are as follows (see
 again Fig. 13):

 The procedure was probably based on geometric deliberations of the following kind:
 First, a double application of the "rectangle diagonal rule " (a Babylonian predecessor
 of the so-called Pythagorean theorem) was used to compute the length of the diagonal

 of a (symmetric) trapezoid. Namely, if h is the height of the trapezoid with the parallel

 sides s and t and the inclined side u, then (see Fig. 14, left)

 sq. u - sq. {(i - t)/2) = sq. Ii — sq.d- sq. {(i + t)/2}.

 Therefore, by the use of the conjugate rule

 sq. d = sq. u + sq. {(i + t)/2} - sq. {(i - 0/2} = sq. « + s · t.

 This "symmetric trapezoid diagonal rule" is a surprising Old Babylonian precursor
 of Ptolemy's well-known theorem about the diagonals of acyclic quadrilateral (Heath
 1981, 2:279).
 Now, let

 / = (s - t)/u = (t - t\)/v\ = (s - t\)/(v\ + u)

 be the common growth rate of the given trapezoid and of the first trapezoid below (to
 the right of) it, the one with the parallel sides t and t\ and the inclined side i>|. See

 sq. v\ - sq. u = (s — t\) ■ t = f ■ (v\ + u) ■ t.

 Therefore, by the use of the conjugate rule again,

 t>i — u — f ■ t.

 Now, finally, the two equations

 vi — u + f ■ t and t\ = t + f ■ v\, where s, t, u, and / have known values,

 together yield the values of uj and t\, and so on. This pair of equations deserves the
 name "the Old Babylonian fixed trapezoid diagonals rule". (Note that the preceding
 explanation of the surprisingly advanced reasoning behind the computational proce
 dure in VAT 8393 is formally quite anachronistic, since Babylonian mathematicians
 had no recourse to symbolic notations).

 5.3 An Old Babylonian generating rule for rational trapezoid triples

 Just as Old Babylonian mathematicians knew a generating rule for right triangles with

 rational sides (or rectangles with rational sides and a rational diameter), they also knew
 a generating rule for divided trapezoids with rational sides and rational transversals.

 As shown in Fig. 15 below, if you suppose that rational values for the partial areas and

 the partial lengths are known, and if you start with the three equations for the areas
 of the whole trapezoid and the two sub-trapezoids, you get a system of three linear

 equations for the unknown parallel sides, s and t, and the unknown transversal d. (See
 the three equations in the middle of Fig. 15). The solution to this system of linear

 equations gives corresponding rational values for s, d, and t. (See the equations to the
 right in Fig. 15).

 The resulting generating rule for a "rational trapezoid triple" (s,d,t) is documented
 in the Old Babylonian mathematical text YBC 4608 (Neugebauer and Sachs 1945,
 text D; Friberg 2007b, 274) in (essentially) the following form:

 (s, d, t) = ((Ρ + Q)/(m + n) — Q/m + P/n, Q/m + Ρ/η

 -(Ρ + Q)/(m + «), (Ρ + Q)/{m + η) + Q/m - Ρ/η).

 When Ρ = Q = Β, the same rule can be expressed in the following equivalent, but
 simpler, form:

 n, m, P, and Q are given
 n, m, P, and Q are given

 s + d + t = (P + Q)/(m + n) + Pin + Q/m
 s + d + t = (P + Q)/(m + n) + P/n + Q/m

 s + t = 2(P + Q)/(m + n)
 s + t = 2(P + Q)/(m + n)

 s = (P + Q)/(m + n) + Pin - Q/m
 s = (P + Q)/(m + n) + P/n - Q/m

 s + d = 2 Pin
 s + d = 2 P/n

 d = P/n + Q/m -(P + Q)l(m + n)
 d = P/n + Q/m -(P + Q)/(m + n)

 d + t = 2 Q/m
 d + t = 2 Q/m

 t = (P + Q)/(m + n)~ Pin + Q/m
 t = (P + Q)/(m + n)~ P/n + Q/m

 (s, d, t) = {B/{(m + n) ■ m · n)} · (sq. m + 2m ■ n — sq. n, sq. m + sq. η,

 sq. n + 2m ■ n — sq. m).

 The mentioned generating rule must have been used also for the construction of

 intriguingly nice data in the Old Babylonian mathematical cuneiform text 1st. Si 269,
 obv. (Friberg 2007b, 279; Fig. 16 above). Indeed, that text contains a diagram showing
 four different divided trapezoids with rational sides and transversals, and with the
 areas of the two sub-trapezoids always in the ratio P:Q = 3000:30 = 60:1 ! The sum
 of the lengths of the two parallel sides is always s +1 = 101 =60+1! The sum of
 the partial lengths is, in all the four cases, η + m = 1 00 = 60. The partial lengths
 are, in the four cases, in the ratios n:m = 15:1, 8:1, 9:1, and 25:2, respectively.

 These ratios, by the way, were not randomly chosen by the author of 1st. Si 269.

 Indeed, it is clear from the form of the equations for (s, d, t ) above that for the equations

 to work, n, m,andm+n must all be regular sexagesimal numbers! Consequently, n/m
 and n/m + 1 must both be regular sexagesimal numbers, instances of what may be
 called "regular twins"! True enough, the four pairs (15, 16), (8, 9), (9, 10), and (12;30,
 13:30) are all regular twins. Similarly, in YBC 4608 (above), the partial lengths η and
 m are in the ratio 1:5, and 1, 5, and 1 + 5 = 6 are all regular sexagesimal numbers. Or,

 you can say that (5, 6) is another case of regular twins.

 5.4 Old Babylonian constructions of chains of bisected trapezoids

 Just as Old Babylonian mathematicians knew that a given trapezoid with a diagonal

 of given length can be joined smoothly to other trapezoids with diagonals of the same
 length, both above and below, they also knew that α given bisected trapezoid can
 be joined smoothly to other bisected trapezoids, both above and below, to form a
 "chain of bisected trapezoids with rational sides and transversals," as in Fig. 17 below.

 Fig. 18 How to join together smoothly two bisected trapezoids

 (For examples, see the Old Babylonian tablets Erm. 15189 (Vaiman 1955; Friberg
 2007b, 287) and AO 17264 (Neugebauer 1935, 126; Friberg 2007b, 292)).

 It is possible that Old Babylonian mathematicians found out that such a construction

 is possible through astute observation and experimentation, but it is also possible that
 they reasoned in the following way (Fig. 18):

 In the diagram above, let / = (s — t)/(m + n) be the growth rate of a given

 trapezoid, the one to the right in the diagram. If here s and t are replaced by their
 expressions in the Old Babylonian generating rule for trapezoid triples (see the line

 just above Fig. 15), then the equation for the growth rate takes the following new form,

 in terms of only the partial lengths m.n, and the partial area B.

 f = jΒ/((m + n) ■ m ■ η)} ■ (2sq. m — 2sq. η)/(ηι + n)

 = {B/((m + n) ■ m ■ η)} ■ 2(m — η).

 There is, of course, a similar expression for the trapezoid to the left. If the two trapezoids

 are supposed to be smoothly connected, they have a common growth rate. Therefore,

 {B'/({m' + n) ■ m ■ η')} ■ (m' — η) — f' = f = {Β/((m + η) ■ m ■ η)} ■ (ηι — η).

 The arbitrarily imposed extra condition that

 m' — η = m — η

 23

 allows this complicated condition for a common growth rate to be simplified to

 B'/({m' + n) ■ m ■ η') = Β/((m + η) ■ m ■ η).

 The two smoothly connected trapezoids must also have a side in common, so that

 t' = .v. If also t' and s are replaced by their expressions in the generating rule for

 trapezoid triples, it follows that

 [B'/{(m + n) ■ m · aj')) · {sq. η + 2m ■ η — sq. m) = t' = s

 = [Β/((m + η) ■ m ■ η)} ■ {sq.m + 2m ■ n — sq.n}.

 In view of the condition for a common growth rate, this condition can be simplified to

 sq. n' + 2m ■ η — sq. m' = sq. m + 2m ■ η — sq. η,

 or, equivalently,

 simplified to

 2sq. η — sq. (m' — η') — 2sq. m - sq. (m - η).

 In view of the extra condition that m' — n' = m — η, this equation, in its turn, can be

 2sq. n' = 2sq. m, or simply n' = m.

 Summing up, one finds that a sufficient, but perhaps not necessary, condition for the

 two bisected trapezoids in the figure above to be smoothly connected is that

 f' = f, m — η = m — n, and n—m.

 It is, indeed, easy to see that these conditions are satisfied in the numerical example

 shown above, in Fig. 17. It is also easy to see that if the numerical data for one bisected

 trapezoid are given, then the corresponding numerical data for smoothly connected

 bisected trapezoids above and below the given one can be computed, effortlessly, by

 the use of these equations alone. Therefore, these three conditions together may be

 called a generating rule for a "chain of (rational) bisected trapezoids".

 5.5 An Old Babylonian rule for the construction of confluent trapezoid bisections

 In the Old Babylonian mathematical cuneiform texts TMS 23 (Bruins and Rutten

 1961; Friberg 2007b, 300) and Erm. 15073 (Vaiman 1961; Friberg 2007b, 304), the

 idea of what may be called "confluent trapezoid bisections" is behind two different,

 but equivalent, generating rules, by the use of which it is possible to construct any

 number of rational sub-trapezoids of a given rational bisected trapezoid, all bisected

 by the same transversal.

 The first of these generating rules can be explained as follows: In Fig. 19 below,

 suppose that the given bisected trapezoid has parallel sides of lengths .v and t, and let

 (s-s')lp = (t'-t)/q

 Fig. 19 How to construct confluent trapezoid bisections

 ρ and q be the heights of two sub-trapezoids cut off at each end of the given trapezoid.
 Suppose that what then remains of the original bisected trapezoid is a bisected sub

 trapezoid with the same bisecting transversal and with parallel sides of lengths s' and t'.
 The two cutoff trapezoids then obviously have equal areas and equal growth rates.

 More precisely, in modern symbolic notations,

 (s + s') ■ ρ = (t + t') ■ q and (s - s')/ρ = (t1 - t)/q.

 This is a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns s' and t'. The solution,

 again in modern symbolic notations, can be shown to be of the form

 s' = a ■ s + b ■ t, t' = b · s — a ■ t,

 where

 a = 2q ■ p/(sq.q + sq. p) and b = (sq. q — sq. p)/(sq. q + sq. p).

 It is easy to see that the expressions above for a and b, with ρ and q rational, can

 be interpreted as a generating rule for the orthogonal sides of rational right triangles
 with diagonals of length 1.

 In other words, the first of the Old Babylonian rules for the construction of con
 fluent bisected trapezoids corresponds to a composition of rational solutions to two
 kinds of indeterminate quadratic equations, the "trapezoid bisection equation" and the

 "rectangle diagonal equation," namely

 sq. s + sq. t — 2sq.d and sq. a + sq. b = sq. c (in the case when c — 1).

 The underlying observation is the following "composition rule":

 sq. (a ■ ί + b ■ t) + sq. (b ■ s — a ■ t) = (sq. a + sq. b) ■ (sq. s + sq. t).

 See the extended historical discussion of this composition rule in Friberg (2007b,
 345 ff).

 5.6 A second Old Babylonian rule for the construction of confluent trapezoid

 bisections

 The second rule for the construction of confluent bisected trapezoids used in the Old

 Babylonian problem text TMS 23 can be explained as follows (Friberg 2007b, 300).

 Let / be the growth rate of the given trapezoid in Fig. 19 above. Then,

 s' =s - f ■ p, t' = t + f q and (2s - f ■ p) ■ ρ = (2t + f ■ q) ■ q(=2B).

 From the last of these equations, it follows that the value of / can be computed as
 follows:

 / = (s · p-t ■ q)/[( sq. ρ + sq. q)/ 2}.

 Consequently, the second rule for the construction of confluent bisected trapezoids is

 simply

 s' = s - ρ ■ (s ■ ρ - t ■ <ji)/{(sq. ρ + sq. q)/2), and

 t' = t + q · (s ■ p - t ■ <7)/{(sq. p + sq. q)/2).

 In the application of the first of the two rules for the construction of confluent

 bisected trapezoids in the mentioned Old Babylonian problem text TMS 23, the para

 meters used are, apparently, the following ones:

 s = 1 45(= 15 · 7), t = 15(= 15 · 1), and p/q = 1/3, so that

 (sq.3-sq. l)/(sq. 3+sq. 1 )=4/5 = ;48, and (2-3- l)/(sq. 3+sq. l) = 3/5 = ;36.

 Accordingly, in this example, the lengths of the parallel sides of the sub-trapezoid
 were computed as

 s' =;48· 1 45+ ;36 · 15 = 1 24 + 9 = 1 33(= 3 -31), /' =;36· 145— ;48 ■ 15

 = 1 03 — 12 = 51(= 3 - 17).

 The solution is correct, which can be shown as follows:

 (sq. s + sq. f)/2 = (sq. 1 45 + sq. 15)/2 = (3 03 45 + 3 45)/2 = 3 07 30/2

 = 1 3345 = sq. 1 15, d = 1 15(= 3 · 25),

 (sq. s' + sq. t'y 2 = (sq. 1 33 + sq. 51)/2 = (2 2409 + 43 21)/2 = 307 30/2

 = 1 3345 = sq. 1 15, d'=\\5=d.

 (Note that the triples (s,d,t) = (1,5,7) and (s,d,t) = (17,25,31) both can be
 found in the diagram in Fig. 17 above).

 In the application of the second rule in the same cuneiform text, TMS 23, the

 parameters used are

 Fig. 20 Another example of a chain of bisected trapezoids with rational sides and transversals

 J = 1 25(=5 · 17), t = 35(=5 · 7), and p/q = 1/2.

 Accordingly, the lengths of the parallel sides of the sub-trapezoid were computed as

 s' = 1 25 - 1 · (1 25 · 1 -35 · 2)/{(sq. 2 + sq. l)/2} = 1 25 - 1 · 6 = 1 19, and

 t' = 35 + 2 · (1 25 · 1 - 35 · 2)/{(sq. 2 + sq. l)/2) = 35 + 2 · 6 = 47.

 The solution is correct, which can be shown as follows:

 (sq.i + sq.i)/2 = (sq. I 25 + sq.35)/2 = (20025 + 2025)/2 = 2 2050/2

 = 1 1025 = sq. 1 05, d = 1 05(= 5 · 13),

 (sq. s' + sq. t')/2 = (sq. 1 19 + sq.47)/2 = (1 44 01 +3649)/2 = 2 2050/2
 = 1 1025 = sq. 1 05, d'=\05 = d.

 Note, by the way, that the triple (s, d, t) = (7, 13, 17) but not the triple (s, d, t) =

 (47, I 05, 1 19) can be found in the diagram in Fig. 17 above. This implies that there
 must exist other possible chains of bisected trapezoids with rational sides than the one
 shown in Fig. 17, for instance, the one above (Fig. 20):

 6 Mathematical texts from the Kassite period (the second half of the second

 Millennium BC)

 6.1 A Kassite boundary value problem for a chain of three bisected trapezoids

 The few mathematical problem texts from the Kassite period that are known are similar

 to Old Babylonian problem texts, but are, for some reason, exceptionally sophisticated.
 One such text contains the computation of the weight of a colossal icosahedron made
 of 20 equilateral copper triangles (Friberg 2007a, 342).

 Another such text is a single problem text containing a kind of "boundary value
 problem" for a trapezoid with sides of given lengths, divided into a chain of three
 bisected trapezoids (AO 17264; Neugebauer 1935, 126; Friberg 2007b, 292). The
 stated problem is to find out how the given trapezoid can be divided among six brothers

 so that the oldest brother and the next one get trapezoidal shares of the same area,

 Fig. 21 AO 17264. Dividing a trapezoidal field between six brothers

 so that numbers 3 and 4 get the same, and also numbers 5 and 6. See Fig. 21 above.
 The student who wrote down his solution to the problem cheated blatantly, but managed

 to find the correct result (which he obviously knew beforehand) through a couple of
 nonsense calculations.

 It is likely that the solution to the mentioned problem was meant to proceed in the
 following way. In the figure above of the divided trapezoid (Fig. 21), the lengths s'
 and t" of the outermost parallels and the length u of the height are supposed to be

 known. Also known is, consequently, the growth rate

 Now, suppose (in order to make the situation as symmetric as possible) that the chain
 of three bisected trapezoids in the figure below has been constructed with departure

 from the bisected trapezoid in the middle, with the (unknown) parameters

 f = (s'-t")/u.

 η, m, s, and f,

 and that the added bisected trapezoids to the left and right have been constructed by

 the use of the generating rule for a chain of bisected trapezoids. See Sect. 5.4 above.
 Then, as indicated in Fig. 21 above, the corresponding parameters for the trapezoid to
 the left are

 m, 2m—n, s', and i,

 while the parameters for the trapezoid to the right are

 2n — m, n, t and t".

 The growth rate / is known. Therefore, if only the values of m and n, too, can be
 computed in some way, it will be easy to compute, subsequently, also the lengths of
 all the parallel lines in Fig. 21.

 Now, one equation for m and η is obvious, namely

 3 (m + n) = m + (2m — η) + η + m + (2 η — m) + η = u.

 (The cheating student managed to get this equation right, at least!)

 J. Friberg

 Another equation for m and η is a consequence of the generating rule for bisected

 trapezoids If the rule is used on the trapezoid to the left in Fig. 21, one sees that

 s ft" = (sq. m + 2m ■ η — sq. «')/(sq· (2η - m) + 2η ■ (2η — m) — sq. η).

 Clearly, now

 Similarly,

 sq. m' + 2m' ■ η — sq. η = sq. (2m — η) + 2(2m — η) ■ m — sq. m

 = 7sq. m — 6m ■ η + sq. n.

 sq. (2η — m) + 2n · (2η — m) — sq. η = 7sq. η - 6m ■ η + sq. m.

 On the other hand, both s' and t" have given values. This means that m and η are

 connected to each other by the following quadratic-linear system of equations:

 s'/t" = (7sq. m — 6m ■ η + sq.n)/(7sq. η — 6m ■ η + sq. m), m + η = μ/3.

 The given parameters in the mentioned Kassite problem text AO 17264 are

 s'= 3 33, i" = 51, « = 215.

 Therefore, in that particular case, m and η are solutions to the equations:

 3 33 ■ (7sq.n — 6m ■ η + sq.m) = 51 ■ (7sq.m — 6 m ■ η + sq .n), m + η = 45.

 After simplification, this becomes the following quadratic-linear system of equations

 4sq. m + 27 m · « = 40 sq. n, m + n =45.

 Because the quadratic equation is homogeneous (it has no linear term), it can be solved

 in the following way: Suppose that

 m = ρ ■ η, where ρ is a new unknown.

 Then, after elimination of a factor sq. n,

 4sq. ρ -(- 27ρ — 40.

 This quadratic equation has the solution ρ = 5/4 = 1 ; 15. Consequently, the original

 quadratic-linear system of equations can be replaced by the following system of only

 linear equations:

 29

 It is easy to see that the solution to this system of linear equations is

 m = 25, η = 20.

 Consequently, the 5 transversals in the divided trapezoid in Fig. 21 divide the height

 of the trapezoid into the following 6 partial lengths:

 m, 2m — n, n,m, 2η — m, η = 25, 30, 20, 25, 15, 20.

 On the other hand,

 Therefore,

 / = (333 - 51)/2 15 = 242/2 15 = 6/5 = 1; 12.

 d' = s'-f-m = 333 — 1; 12 · 25 = 333 - 30 = 303,

 and so on. The complete solution is

 s',d',s,d,t,d",t" = 3 33,303,2 27,203, 133, 1 15,51

 = 3 (1 11, 101,49,41,31,25, 17).

 (Compare this result with the chain of trapezoids in Fig. 17 above).

 Thus, although the student who wrote the text AO 17264 found the correct solution

 by cheating and knowing the answer beforehand, he should have been able to find the

 solution honestly by working hard in the way described above.

 6.2 A similar problem for a chain of two bisected trapezoids

 It is instructive to see how the method used above to solve the problem stated in

 AO 17264 would work in a related but (much) simpler case. (This particular case is

 undocumented, but it is not uncommon in Babylonian mathematical texts that a given

 type of problem is worked through in a number of related cases, usually starting with

 the simplest possible case). Suppose, therefore, that a trapezoidal field with the length

 1 00 (=60) and with parallel sides of lengths 7 and 31 shall be divided between four

 brothers, so that the oldest brother and the next brother get trapezoidal shares of the

 same size, and so that also brothers 3 and 4 get equal trapezoidal shares.

 The new situation is described in Fig. 22 below. In this situation,

 u = m + (2m - η) + η + m = Am, so that m = u/4 = 15.

 In addition, it follows from the generating rule for a chain of bisected trapezoids
 (see Sect. 5.4) that

 (7sq. m —6m ■ η + sq. n)/(sq. η + 2m ■ η — sq. m) = s'/t = 31/7.

 Expressed differently,

 7 · (7sq. m — 6m ■ η + sq. n) = 31 · (sq. η + 2m ■ η — sq. m).

 After simplification, this equation is replaced by the new equation

 10 sq. m = 3 sq. η + 13 m η.

 Since m = 15 is already known, this is a quadratic equation for n:

 10 · 3 45 = 3 sq. η + 13 · 15 · η, or, after division by 3, sq. η + 1 05 η = 12 30.

 Solving this quadratic equation, one finds that η = 10. Consequently,

 m, 2m — n, n, m — 15, 20, 10, 15, and s', d', s, d, t — 31, 25, 17, 13, 7.

 This result agrees with what is shown in Fig. 17 above.

 7 Mathematical texts from the Achaemenid period (c. 540-330 BC)

 There are only a few known mathematical cuneiform texts from this period, among

 other things for the reason that clay tablets as a medium for writing in cuneiform had
 largely fallen out of use, and the new writing materials were far less durable than
 clay and have not been preserved. Nevertheless, the few still existing Achaemenid
 mathematical cuneiform texts show quite clearly that not all of the Old Babylonian
 achievements in mathematics had been forgotten a whole millennium after the end of
 the Old Babylonian period.

 Thus, the Old Babylonian factorization method for the computation of reciprocals

 of regular sexagesimal numbers by the use of clever arithmetical algorithms was still

 in use, while the standard Old Babylonian 2-place table of reciprocals had grown into
 much larger "many-place" tables. (See, for instance, Friberg 1999b). Quadratic equa
 tions were still being studied, in particular the mentioned "igi-igi.bi problems" (see

 Sect. 5.1 above), which are closely related to the generating rules for right triangles

 with rational sides. The affinity between Old Babylonian and Achaemenid mathe
 matical texts is even more clear in view of the fact that in some known Achaemenid

 mathematical texts (W 23291 and W 23291 -x), mathematical problems have a solution

 in terms of Old Babylonian length and surface measures, side by side with a solution
 in terms of contemporary length and surface measures. (See Friberg et al. 1990, §§
 4-8 and Friberg 1997, §§ 1-3).

 There is only one example of a geometrical recursive algorithm in the known
 Achaemenid mathematical texts, but that example appears twice, in one case in an
 "Old Babylonian" version, in another case in a contemporary version. In the Old
 Babylonian version (Fig. 23 below; Friberg et al. 1990, 494), the stated problem is

 how a circle of given circumference 60 rods can be divided into five concentric circular

 rings, all of the same given width, 2 rods. In the Achaemenid version (W 23291, § lg;

 Friberg 1997, 272). the question is how a circle of given "seed (surface) measure" can
 be divided into concentric circular rings, all of the given width 1 rod.

 The problem in W 23291 -x, § 2 is solved in the following way. Let A be the area of
 a circle, a its circumference, and d its diameter. Then, in this text, as normally also in

 Old Babylonian mathematical texts, the following simple but convenient assumptions
 are made:

 A = (appr.) : 05 · sq. a, d = (appr.) ; 20 a.

 As a consequence of these assumptions, the areas and circumferences of the concentric
 circles in the figure below can be computed by the use of the following recursive
 algorithms:

 a, = 1(60), d\ =20, A\ = 5 00, d„ - d„+ \ =2-2,

 a„-an+1=3·2·2, A„ - Α,,+ι = (a„ + an+\) · 1 for «=1,2,3,4.

 The result of the computations is indicated in a diagram in the cuneiform text, namely
 that the five circumferences are 1 (00), 48, 36, 24. and 12 (rods), that the five diameters

 a5 = 24 - 3 ■ 2 · 2 = 12, A4 - A5 = (24 + 12)/2 · 2 = 18 · 2 = 36,

 A5 = 12 · 12·; 05 = 12, (Αι — A2) + (A2 — A3) + (A3 — A4) + (A4 — A5)

 8 Conclusion

 The author's intention has been that the discussion above should demonstrate the amaz

 ing persistence of the Mesopotamian mathematical tradition, stretching over three full

 millennia and many different historical periods, and involving a long series of impres

 sive developments of mathematical ideas and methods. One clear but unsurprising

 example of the longevity of Mesopotamian mathematical traditions is the continued

 use of sexagesimal numbers as the numbers used for calculations, from, probably,

 before the invention of writing in the fourth millennium BC and for as long as the

 cuneiform script stayed in use. Interesting mathematical problems in terms of regu

 lar sexagesimal numbers, often many-place such numbers, appear first in texts from

 the Old Akkadian period in the third millennium BC, but enjoyed a great popularity

 also in mathematical cuneiform texts from the Old Babylonian period in the second

 millennium BC, and from the Achaemenid and later periods in the first millennium
 BC.

 The real surprise is the discovery of the central role played by various methods

 of formulating and solving more or less difficult field division problems, beginning

 with the field expansion procedure, which appears to have been in use for about a

 millennium with start in the proto-literate period, until it was replaced by more exact

 methods to solve quadratic equations, probably in the Old Akkadian period. In the

 more advanced stages of the curriculum of the Old Babylonian scribe school, the study

 of problems involving quadratic equations of many different kinds, and many different

 degrees of complexity, played a central role (as shown in H0yrup 2002). However,

 the most impressive results of this study were a truly astonishing variety of recursive

 geometric algorithms for the repeated division of trapezoidal fields into chains ofsub

 trapezoids with rational sides and transversals or diagonals. Even after the intense

 blossoming of mathematics in the Old Babylonian period, the interest for imaginative

 field division problems remained, which is shown by interesting trapezoid division

 and circle division texts from the Kassite and Achaemenid periods.

 Incidentally, the last blossoming of Mesopotamian mathematics was the amaz

 ing rise of mathematical astronomy in the second half of the first millennium BC.
 This development would scarcely have been possible without, for instance, the

 previous invention of sexagesimal numbers in place value notation, or operations

 with many-place regular sexagesimal numbers using clever arithmetical algorithms,

 or the intensive occupation with geometrical recursive algorithms.

 It ought to be evident that so many achievements in Mesopotamian mathematics
 over such a long period of time could not pass unnoticed by surrounding cultures,

 even if, by necessity, the detailed mechanisms of any diffusion of knowledge will

 remain unknown. Anyway, in the 18 chapters of Friberg (2007b), it is shown by a

 multitude of elaborately argued examples that many of the basic concepts and methods

 in classical Greek mathematics have obvious Babylonian predecessors. Among those

 important parts of Greek mathematics with Babylonian, predecessors are the quadratic

 equations in Books II and X ofEuclid's Elements, in Euclid's Data, and in Diophantus'
 Arithmetica (Friberg 2007b, Chs. 1, 5, 10, and 13), and the division of figures in

 Euclid's lost book On Divisions (op. cit., Ch. 11).

 A complement to Friberg (2007b) is, by the way, Friberg (2013), where it is shown

 that also classical Greek music theory in works by Euclid and Ptolemy, and others, in

 particular the construction of diatonic heptatonic scales by the use of recursive tuning

 procedures, had important Old Babylonian predecessors. Interestingly, in one Old

 Babylonian text, the seven notes of a heptatonic scale, and certain intervals between

 them, were represented geometrically by the points and sides of a seven-sided star

 figure.
