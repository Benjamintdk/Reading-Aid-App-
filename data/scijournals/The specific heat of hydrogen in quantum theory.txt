 Abstract The specific heat of hydrogen gas at low temperatures was first mea-
 sured in 1912 by Arnold Eucken in Walther Nernsťs laboratory in Berlin, and pro-
 vided one of the earliest experimental supports for the new quantum theory. Even
 earlier, Nernst had developed a quantum theory of rotating diatomic gas molecules
 that figured in the discussions at the first Solvay conference in late 1911. Between
 1913 and 1925, Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, Max Planck, Fritz Reiche, and Erwin

 Schrödinger, among many others, attempted theoretical descriptions of the rotational

 specific heat of hydrogen, with only limited success. Quantum theory also was central

 to the study of molecular spectra, where initially it was more successful. Moreover,

 the two problems interacted in sometimes surprising ways. Not until 1927, follow-
 ing Werner Heisenberg's discovery of the behavior of indistinguishable particles in
 modern quantum mechanics, did American theorist David Dennison find a successful

 theory of the specific heat of hydrogen.

 of the rotational specific heat of hydrogen gas.1 In one of the earliest confirmations of

 the new quantum theory, the specific heat of hydrogen at constant volume falls sharply

 from 5/2 R (where R is the gas constant) at room temperature to 3/2 R at about 40 К
 as the rotational degrees of freedom disappear. Reiche's paper was admirable - clear,

 thorough, and employing the full power of the formalism for describing quantum

 systems that physicists had developed in the nearly 20 years since Planck's first anal-
 ysis of black-body radiation late in 1900. And yet Reiche was unsuccessful. None of
 his models described the specific-heat data accurately, and the ones that came closest
 required arbitrary and implausible assumptions. The quotation in the title, a descrip-

 tion of the state of quantum theory from Reiche's 1921 textbook,2 applies equally to

 his influential efforts to understand the specific heat of hydrogen.

 Attempts to understand the specific heats of gases go back to the early days of

 nineteenth-century kinetic theory. The equipartition theorem3 made specific predic-

 tions for gases: each degree of freedom - more precisely, each quadratic term in the

 energy - should contribute 1/2 RT to the average thermal energy per mole and 1/2 R

 to the specific heat at constant volume. It became increasingly clear that this theorem
 was an inescapable consequence of classical mechanics. Nevertheless, monatomic and
 diatomic gases stubbornly refused to obey it.

 A monatomic gas molecule, for example, has three translational and three rotational

 degrees of freedom. Its molar specific heat at constant volume should therefore be 3R.

 In fact, measurements of the specific heat of mercury vapor, and later of noble gases

 such as argon and helium, consistently found half that value. Apparently, the rotational
 degrees of freedom were missing: monatomic gas molecules did not rotate.

 Diatomic gases presented an even more difficult case. Physicists pictured diatomic

 molecules as rotating dumbbells, with three translational and three rotational degrees
 of freedom - that is, molecules should be free to rotate independently about three coor-

 dinate axes (Fig. 1). The combined translational and rotational specific heat at constant

 volume again should be 3 R per mole. Moreover, if the two atoms are not rigidly con-

 nected but instead joined by a spring, there should be an additional contribution of Ry

 from the kinetic and potential vibrational energies.

 Once again, experiments told a different story. The specific heat at constant vol-

 ume of nitrogen and oxygen is almost exactly 5/2 R at room temperature, and that
 of hydrogen only slightly lower. Apparently, only two rotational degrees of freedom
 were present; and these molecules did not vibrate. But other diatomic gases such as
 chlorine had higher specific heats. Worse yet, the specific heats of diatomic gases
 steadily increase as the temperature rises, suggesting an inexplicable gradual onset of
 additional degrees of freedom. For example, the specific heat at constant volume of

 1 Reiche (1919).

 2 Reiche (1921, p. 125).

 The equipartition theorem, whose roots go back to Clausius, Maxwell, and Boltzmann, asserts that each

 separable quadratic contribution to kinetic or potential energy contributes 1/2 RT per mole to the average
 (thermal) energy, and hence 1/2 R to the specific heat. The theory worked better for solids than for gases:
 if one regards a solid as a collection of three-dimensional harmonic oscillators, equipartition predicted a
 specific heat of 3 Rt in agreement with the widely obeyed Law of Petit and Dulong. It was this law that
 Einstein had challenged in 1907 with his theory of quantized Planck oscillators.

 passes through though the center of mass, perpendicular to the line joining the two masses. The axis is

 The net result is a rotation about an axis fixed in space in the direction of the angular momentum, с A
 symmetric or gyroscopic rotator with three rotational degrees of freedom. The third rotational degree of
 freedom corresponds to a rotation about an axis through the two masses; that axis in turn precesses about

 the fixed direction of the angular momentum

 chlorine gas rises from 3 R (not 5/2 R ) at room temperature to about 7/2 R at temper-

 atures over 1,000 K, where it finally becomes constant.4 This profound disagreement

 between theory and experiment did not go unnoticed. James Clerk Maxwell in 1875

 called it "the greatest difficulty yet encountered by the molecular theory," and in 1900,

 it was one of the two clouds that Lord Kelvin saw hanging over physics. More optimis-

 tically, Ludwig Boltzmann argued that atoms and molecules might be "smooth," so that

 rotational energy about axes of symmetry could not be changed in collisions or appear

 in specific heats. This confusing state of affairs still echoes in today's introductory
 physics textbooks.5

 The problem thus remained a mystery when quantum theory appeared on the scene

 early in the twentieth century. Late in 1900, Max Planck had distributed finite "energy

 elements" among harmonic oscillators in equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation

 in order to explain black-body radiation. In 1906, Albert Einstein had treated a solid as
 a collection of Planck oscillators, and showed that the specific heat should fall to zero

 at low temperatures. By late in the nineteenth century, physicists and physical chem-

 ists were learning to liquefy gases, first air in the late 1870s, then hydrogen in the late

 1890s, and finally helium in 1908. As a result, measurements of specific heats at low
 temperatures became feasible. By 1910, Einstein's prediction had been conclusively
 confirmed, and it had become apparent to many theoretical physicists that strange as

 it might seem, Planck's quantized oscillators had to be taken seriously.

 But how deep did quantum theory go? What other systems should show quantum
 behavior? How should they be treated? The answers were not obvious. Still, it is hardly

 surprising to find that the rotating dumbbell was one of the earliest problems to be
 taken up: perhaps quantum theory could shed light on the inexplicable state of gas

 theory.

 This hope was shortly confirmed, and the quantum solution to the equipartition

 dilemma soon became a textbook example.6 But rotating quantum dumbbells dis-

 played equally pressing difficulties of their own. For the specific heat of hydrogen,
 qualitative agreement between theory and experiment was quickly achieved. Quan-
 titative agreement was another matter. Reiche's 1919 paper on the specific heat of
 hydrogen was only the latest in a long series, though it was by far the most com-
 prehensive and complete, and was widely cited for many years. Nor was it to be
 the last. The first measurements had been published early in 1912. Theoretical stud-
 ies had begun even earlier. Starting in 1911, and extending through the mid- 1920s,
 such notables as Walther Nernst, Albert Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, Niels Bohr, and

 Erwin Schrödinger all made their attempts. In the United States, they were joined by
 Edwin C. Kemble, Richard C. Tolman, and John H. Van Vleck. The specific heat of
 hydrogen likewise figured prominently in review articles and textbooks throughout
 this period. It was a central problem in the "old quantum theory" - the suggestive

 but ultimately unsuccessful theory that unfolded in the first quarter of the twentieth

 century.7

 It should have been a simple problem. Rotating dumbbells - in particular, the rigid

 rotator and its more complex cousin, the symmetric (or gyroscopic) rotator (see Fig. 1 )
 were then as now textbook problems in classical mechanics.8 The quantum rotator,

 the theoretical underpinning for rotational specific heats, made its first appearance in

 1911, and even when extended to two or three degrees of freedom, was far less com-

 plex than many other problems treated in the old quantum theory. Generalized to a

 nonrigid, vibrating rotator, it was also central to the developing discipline of molecular

 spectra - here, the old quantum theory proved a more reliable guide. The two prob-
 lems turned out to be interrelated: as the years wore on, a close connection between
 the specific heat of hydrogen and molecular spectra became increasingly apparent.9

 Here I tell the story of the rotational specific heat of hydrogen in the old quan-
 tum theory and modern quantum mechanics. This story is not as well known as the

 attempts to describe such problems as the Bohr atom, the helium atom, dispersion, and

 6 See for example Reiche (1921, Chapter 4, Sect. 1).

 7 A few of the more prominent texts and review articles include Adams (1920-1923), Eucken (1920a),
 Reiche (1921), Eucken (1926), Herzfeld (1925), Kemble et al. (1926), Lewis (1918-1924), Partington and
 Shilling (1924), Smekal (1926), Van Vleck (1926b). For later treatments enthusiastically describing the
 modern quantum-mechanical solution, see for example Van Vleck (1929), Fowler (1929-1936), and Mayer
 and Mayer (1940).

 ® See for example Sommerfeld (1950, Sects. 18, 35), Symon (1960, pp. 384-387). The "rigid rotator"
 consists of two point masses separated by a fixed distance, and has two rotational degrees of freedom; in
 textbooks, it is often treated as a spherical pendulum, in which a single reduced mass rotates about the
 center of mass. The symmetric rotator, with three degrees of freedom, can in addition rotate about a line
 joining the two masses. See Fig. 1 .

 9 Historical accounts of molecular spectra may be found in Brand ( 1 995), Fujisaki ( 1 982, 1 983a, b), Assmus
 (1991, 1992a,b, 1999), and Cassidy (2007). Occasional and for the most part brief discussions appear in
 Mehra and Rechenberg (1982-2000). These works contain references to the fairly slim earlier literature.
 Historians have devoted even less attention to the specific heat of hydrogen. Fujisaki (1983a,b) gives an

 introduction, and occasional references can be found in Assmus ( 1 99 1 , 1 992a, b) and Mehra and Rechenberg
 (1982-2000, Vol. 1, Section 7, and the index to Vol. 6). Perhaps the most detailed account is in Tomonaga
 (1997, Chapter 4). See also Needell (1980, pp. 252-262), Kuhn (1978, esp. p. 246), and Klein (1970,
 pp. 264-270). Many of these references are brief or limited in scope, and some are occasionally misleading.

 the anomalous Zeeman effect in the old quantum theory. But it was equally central.

 Some of the most prominent physicists of the twentieth century, along with a good

 many who are not well known today, expended enormous effort and ingenuity, and

 made what seem today like the wildest speculations, in an attempt to solve what turned

 out to be an intractable problem. No quantitatively accurate solution emerged until
 David Dennison discovered the modern solution in 1 927, 10 two years after Werner

 Heisenberg had inaugurated modern quantum mechanics. That solution in turn shed

 light on the nature of indistinguishable particles in quantum mechanics, one of its most

 surprising and unexpected features. In retrospect, the failure of the old quantum theory

 to solve this problem is not so surprising, since the modern solution depends centrally

 on these indistinguishable particles. We will thus see a scientific community coping
 with a prolonged inability to solve a seemingly elementary problem. Moreover, we
 will see how the successful solution of a long-standing problem provided additional

 and persuasive confirmation of modern quantum mechanics - so much so, that Werner

 Heisenberg^ 1932 Nobel Prize was awarded "for the creation of quantum mechanics,

 the application of which has, inter alia , led to the discovery of the allotropie forms of

 hydrogen."1 1

 1.1 Outline

 In Sect. 2, 1 describe the experiments on the specific heat of hydrogen, which along
 with measurements of the infrared absorption spectrum of HCl provided much of the

 early experimental support for the new quantum theory. Nernst and Einstein devel-

 oped the first theory, in which the rotator was not quantized at all, and applied it to

 the specific heat of hydrogen; I describe their efforts in Sect. 3. Beginning in 1913, a
 succession of theorists starting with Ehrenfest applied theories of quantized rotators

 to the specific heat of hydrogen, at first with only one degree of freedom, and then

 beginning in 1915, with several degrees of freedom. I treat this work in Sects. 4 and 5.

 In Sect. 6, 1 take up molecular spectra in diatomic molecules - a related problem
 that likewise involved quantized rotating dumbbells. Here, we encounter, in a nearly

 forgotten episode, Reiche's and Einstein's independent discovery of "half-quanta" in

 the old quantum theory, shortly before Werner Heisenberg introduced them to atomic
 spectra. The old quantum theory with the addition of half-quanta worked well for
 molecular spectra; but Sect. 7 describes the subsequent and unsuccessful attempts to

 apply them to the specific heat of hydrogen. Even the emergence of modern quantum
 mechanics in 1925-1926 did not at first result in a successful theory of the specific

 heat of hydrogen, as we shall see in Sect. 8.

 Late in 1926, Heisenberg realized for the first time the importance of indistinguish-

 able particles in quantum mechanics and applied these new ideas to the spectrum
 of helium and to new experimental conundrums in molecular spectra, described in
 Sect. 9. But even these efforts did not immediately bear fruit. Section 10 shows how

 Heisenberg^ friend and colleague Friedrich Hund applied Heisenberg^ indistinguish-

 able particles to a theory of the specific heat of hydrogen early in 1927, in the course
 of a series of central papers applying quantum mechanics to molecules.

 Hund thought he had succeeded. But in Sect. 11,1 outline a series of innovative and

 difficult experiments on the spectrum of molecular hydrogen in the far ultraviolet, that

 beginning late in 1926 led to an independent measurement of the moment of inertia
 of the hydrogen molecule. These experiments were the rock on which Hunďs theory
 foundered. Section 12 shows how the American theorist David Dennison, who was

 in Copenhagen from 1924 through 1926 and had seen the new quantum mechanics
 emerge at first hand, pulled all of these threads together in mid- 1927 and formulated
 the modern theory. Section 13 shows how Dennison's theory was experimentally
 confirmed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. I bring the story to an end in Sect. 14.

 2 Nernst's heat theorem and the specific heat of hydrogen

 Our story begins with Walther Nernst who, shortly after moving from Göttingen to

 Berlin in 1906, proposed his heat theorem as a solution to the long-standing problem of

 chemical affinity: how could one predict the equilibrium point of a chemical reaction
 from thermochemical data?12 A full discussion of Nernst's heat theorem would take

 us too far afield. In brief, his theorem predicted that at low temperatures, the specific

 heats of solids and liquids should be additive.13 As Nernst put it in his Yale Silliman
 Lectures in 1906,

 For the specific heats of liquids or solids at the absolute zero, our hypothesis
 requires that every atom shall have a definite value for the atomic heat, inde-

 pendent of the form, crystallized or liquid (i.e., amorphous), and whether it is in
 chemical combination with other atoms.

 He immediately added that:

 Numerous measurements . . . have shown . . . that the atomic heats in the solid

 state decrease greatly at low temperatures, but at the present time it is impossible

 to calculate the limiting value toward which they tend.14

 In a paper submitted at the end of 1906, he noted that specific-heat measurements at

 temperatures down to the boiling point of hydrogen, or in some cases, that of oxygen,
 should suffice to test his new heat theorem.15

 12 Secondary literature on Nernst's heat theorem includes Coffey (2006), Kox (2006), Barkan (1999),
 Hiebert (1980, 1983), Klein (1965), and Kuhn (1978, esp. Chapter IX). Many of these treatments are fairly
 brief. For detailed accounts that describe the chemical context, one can do worse than consult Nernst him-

 self; see especially Nernst (1907), the various editions and translations of Nernst (1893-1926), and Nernst
 (1918).

 13 This condition cannot apply to reactions in gases, since the number of degrees of freedom and therefore
 the specific heat can change during the reaction. For one of Nernst's formulations, see Nernst (1893-1926,
 6th ed. [1909], p. 695). To be sure, by considering condensed phases and gases in equilibrium, he could
 also find the equilibrium points of gas reactions.

 Thus, as early as 1906, Nernst seems to have looked on the law of Dulong and
 Petit, which predicts a constant molar specific heat for solids of 3/?, as not beyond
 challenge. He elaborated on this point in the fifth (1907) edition of his Theoreti-
 cal Chemistry , where it is evident that the specific-heat data he cited (including
 some of his own preliminary results), although fragmentary and inconclusive, nev-
 ertheless showed specific heats of solids at low temperatures becoming smaller
 than 3 R.16

 Nernst published little during his first few years in Berlin. He seems to have spent
 much of his time setting up his laboratory and developing the sophisticated apparatus

 and experimental technique for low-temperature measurements. The development of
 a vacuum calorimeter that allowed measurements of specific heats over small temper-

 ature intervals was especially critical. The year 1910 saw the first in a series of papers

 giving the specific heats of solids down to liquid-air temperatures (about 75 K), for
 both compounds and elements.17

 At first, Nernsťs new heat theorem was entirely a matter of chemistry. But at some

 point he learned, possibly from his Berlin colleague Max Planck, that Albert Einstein,
 then an examiner in the Swiss Patent Office, had in 1907 published a paper based on

 Planck's quantum oscillators predicting that the specific heats of solids should vanish
 at absolute zero.18

 Nernst reacted with characteristic vigor. By 1909, he was beginning to see that his

 heat theorem was intimately related to the new quantum theory. He had first referred
 to Einstein's work in the sixth (1909) edition of his Theoretical Chemistry .l9 And

 in February of 1910, he observed in one of his first reports on his low-temperature
 measurements that "one gets the impression that the specific heats are converging to

 zero, as required by Einstein's theory."20 The next month, he descended on Zurich to

 meet Einstein, then a newly appointed professor at the University of Zurich, and sent a

 glowing report in a letter to the English physicist Arthur Schuster.21 And that summer,
 Nernst took the leading role in organizing the first Solvay conference to discuss the

 implications of the emerging quantum theory.22 That conference met in Brussels in
 late October and early November 1911. Nernsťs report contained pages of specific-

 heat data, by now extended to liquid-hydrogen temperatures (around 25 K). Einstein's

 report included a graph that showed how well Nernsťs measurements supported his

 own theory, in far more detail than the fragmentary data on diamonds that was all he

 could cite in 1907. He expressed his gratitude, referring to "Nernst, who rescued all

 the results pertaining to this question from their theoretical limbo...."23

 Although Nernsťs heat theorem initially applied only to solids and liquids, he hoped

 that it would apply to gases as well. In 1914, in a remarkable anticipation of later the-

 ories of quantum gases, he suggested that monatomic gases would show "degenerate"
 behavior - that is, pressures would become constant and specific heats approach zero
 as the temperature of the gas approached absolute zero.24

 In 191 1, however, Nernsťs aims were more limited. In February 1911, well before

 the Solvay conference, he submitted a paper titled "On the theory of specific heats and

 the lessons of energy quanta for questions in physical chemistry generally."25 It shows

 the close connection he had come to see between his heat theorem and the new quan-

 tum theory. Nernst argued that quantum theory might clarify long-standing puzzles

 with the specific heats of gases. In particular, he predicted that the rotational contri-

 bution to the specific heats of diatomic gases should fall to zero at low temperatures,
 and that:

 a falling off of the [rotational energy] at low temperatures will be all the more

 likely to occur, the smaller the distance between the two atoms and the smaller

 their masses. In this last respect, hydrogen occupies an exceptional position, and
 it is in fact the only gas that appears to possess noticeably smaller values [of
 the specific heat at room temperature]. The determination of the specific heat of

 hydrogen at low temperatures would therefore be especially interesting.26

 2.1 The first experiments: Eucken, Scheel, and Heuse

 Where Nernst proposed, his students and assistants disposed. The task of measur-
 ing the specific heat of hydrogen fell to Arnold Eucken, who had received his Ph.D.
 in Nernsťs laboratory in 1906. In 1908, he became one of Nernsťs assistants, and
 played a central role in designing the vacuum calorimeter that Nernsťs group used
 to measure the specific heats of solids. Eucken readily adapted these methods to his

 measurements of the specific heat of hydrogen.27 He measured temperatures using a

 thin platinum-wire thermometer, another technique that he and Nernst had developed.

 Both the experiment and the data reduction were challenging. Eucken crammed

 about 0.2 moles of hydrogen into a 39-cm3 thin steel container - the pressures were

 thus very high, on the order of tens of atmospheres. The container was filled through
 a capillary tube of negligible volume, so that the heat capacity at constant volume
 was measured directly. However, the heat capacity of the container was not negligible.

 Vol. 3, Docs. 25-27). Einstein's graph was in fact taken from Nernst (1911b).

 on to a long and distinguished career; see Dostrovsky (1970), Bartholomé (1950), and Oesper (1950).

 had a heat capacity only 20-40% higher than when empty. Only at the lowest temper-

 atures was the heat capacity of the container much smaller than that of the hydrogen

 gas. Eucken therefore had to measure the heat capacity of his container both filled and

 empty, and subtract to find the heat capacity of hydrogen. He was well aware of the

 risk of errors that this procedure entailed, but nevertheless estimated his uncertainty

 at about 1%, with the largest uncertainties at high temperatures. In addition, since

 the heat capacity of a real gas depends on its density, Eucken had to reduce his high-
 pressure measurements to calculate the specific heat of hydrogen at low pressures,
 where it closely approximated an ideal gas. He used the Berthelot equation of state.

 Eucken's paper appeared in February 1912.28 In what must have been a gratifying

 result, he found that the specific heat of hydrogen fell from its value of just under 5/2
 R at room temperature to 3/2 /?, the expected value for a monatomic gas, at around
 40 К - see Fig. 2. Nernsťs prediction had been spectacularly confirmed. Remarkably,
 Eucken attempted to fit his results to Einstein's 1907 formula for the specific heat of
 a solid, with only qualitative success. This circumstance will seem less surprising as
 our story unfolds.

 Early in 1913, Karl Scheel and Wilhelm Heuse at the Physikalisch-Technische

 Reichsanstalt (PTR) added three more points (Fig. 2), in the second of two articles on

 28 Eucken (1912). See also Partington and Shilling (1924).

 the specific heats of gases published in the Annalen der Physik .29 Scheel and Heuse

 used an entirely different technique, the "method of constant flow," in which heat was

 added to gas flowing through a chamber, and the increase in temperature measured.
 Their first article gave results only for air. The second, which introduced a closed cir-

 culation system, gave measurements for several gases. One can readily imagine that

 Nernst or Planck might have suggested including hydrogen. Without Eucken's vacuum

 calorimeter, Scheel and Heuse were limited to the three available temperature baths
 in which they could immerse their apparatus - water at room temperature, a mixture
 of carbon dioxide and alcohol at about 197K, and liquid oxygen at about 90 K. Their

 experiment measured the specific heat at constant pressure, and so their results had to

 be reduced to constant volume, after corrections for heat loss and high pressure.

 As Fig. 2 shows, and as Scheel and Heuse pointed out, the two sets of measure-

 ments were in good agreement. The overlap at 197 К is especially noteworthy, since

 most of the early theoretical descriptions failed in just this region. In retrospect, both
 measurements at 197 К are slightly high in comparison to later ones (Figs. 8, 11).
 These later measurements, however, did not begin to appear until the mid- 1920s, and

 would not have improved matters significantly. For over a decade, the data shown in

 Fig. 2 provided the only guidance for theorists.

 3 Earliest quantum theories of the specific heat of hydrogen

 The experiments showed that the rotational degrees of freedom of hydrogen gas are
 "freezing out" at low temperature. Nernst and Eucken argued that this remarkable
 turn of events must have its origin in the strange new quantum ideas of Planck and

 Einstein. In 1911, these ideas were still unknown territory to most physicists. Even

 such an enthusiast as Nernst could say that: "At the present time, the quantum theory
 is nothing more than a rule for calculation, and to be sure, as one can well say, of a
 very strange nature. . .."30

 How should these strange and poorly understood new ideas be applied to a rotat-

 ing dumbbell, a system quite different from the quantized oscillators of Planck and

 Einstein? Nernsťs attempt, which he outlined in his February 1911 paper even before

 Eucken' s data had appeared, was the first in a long line. These theoretical attempts to

 describe the specific heat of hydrogen can be grouped conveniently into four stages:

 • The unquantized quantum rotator: Nernst, Einstein, Otto Stern, and Adriaan

 Fokker, 1911-1913 (Sect. 3.1);

 • Quantized rigid rotators with one rotational degree of freedom: Hendrik Antoon

 Lorentz, Paul Ehrenfest, Erik Holm, and others, 191 1-1916 or so (Sect. 4);

 • Quantized rigid (and sometimes vibrating) rotators with two (and occasionally

 three) rotational degrees of freedom: Planck, Reiche, Bohr, Kemble, and others,
 1915-1925 (Sects. 5, 7); and finally,

 29 Scheel and Heuse (1912, 1913). Specific heats were important for technology as well as for physics; see
 Cahan (1989, pp. 197-198), Barkan (1999, pp. 148-150), and Partington and Shilling (1924, pp. 106-1 10).

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 123

 • Modern quantum mechanics, first formulated in 1 925 : Van Vleck, Hund, Dennison,

 and others (Sects. 9, 10, 12).

 Nor was the hydrogen molecule the only rotating system under study. In 1912,

 Niels Bjerrum, a Danish chemist working in Nernsťs laboratory, used a quantized

 rotator to describe the role of rotations and vibrations in molecular spectra.31 During

 the 1920s, the connection of specific-heat measurements to molecular spectra became

 increasingly apparent, first with vibration-rotation spectra in diatomic molecules such
 as HCl, and later with combined electronic, vibrational, and rotational transitions in

 the spectrum of molecular hydrogen (Sects. 6, 11).

 Our story has no one actor and no one approach. For over 1 5 years, a veritable army

 of physicists and physical chemists, some eminent, others little known, struggled to

 understand the specific heat of hydrogen within an evolving theoretical structure that
 in the end never quite worked. Even the advent of modern quantum mechanics in
 1925 did not lead to instant success. It took two more years and a breakthrough in

 measurements of the molecular spectra of hydrogen before David Dennison could for-

 mulate the modern theory in 1927. Dennison's theory was a second example, following
 Heisenberg^ success with the spectrum of helium, of the unexpectedly central role
 of indistinguishable particles and wave-function symmetries in the new theory. The

 detailed treatments subsequently found in textbooks and review articles, not to men-

 tion the sense of relief they display, give further evidence for the prominence of the

 specific heat of hydrogen in the first three decades of quantum theory. This problem,
 little-known today, shows in miniature the dilemmas faced by quantum theorists in

 the first quarter of the twentieth century.

 3.1 Nernst and the unquantized quantum rotator

 In a 1913 appreciation of Max Planck, Einstein observed that "the thermal energy of

 every structure depends on the temperature in the same way as that of the resonators
 in Planck's theory...."32 The context of that quotation was, to be sure, the specific
 heat of solids. Nevertheless, it describes perfectly this early effort to understand the

 specific heat of hydrogen.

 In the same February 1911 paper, in which Nernst had proposed measuring the

 specific heat of hydrogen, he laid out the first theory to explain why the specific heat

 of a collection of rotating dumbbells should fall off at low temperatures. Surprisingly,

 from a modern point of view, he did not quantize the rotator. Instead, he considered
 rotating diatomic gas molecules to be in equilibrium with a collection of quantized
 oscillators, relying heavily on Einstein (1907) treatment of the latter.

 In a 1942 obituary, Einstein described Nernsťs scientific style:

 Nernsťs standard work, "Theoretical Chemistry," offers, not only to the student
 but also to the scholar, an abundance of stimulating ideas; it is theoretically

 31 Bjerrum (1912). See also Fujisaki (1983a,b), and Assmus (1991, 1992a,b). Assmus has called attention
 to the central role played by molecular problems in the early years of quantum theory, well before Bohr
 took up atomic spectra.

 elementary, but clever, vivid, and full of intimations of manifold interrelations.

 It truly reflects his intellectual character.33

 The same description might apply to this paper. Nernst was not particularly rigorous.

 But his physical intuition was extraordinary. As one might expect, he reviewed his

 recent measurements of the specific heats of solids. Nevertheless, the paper is as much

 about gases as solids. He began, appropriately for a student of Boltzmann, by point-

 ing out long-standing conflicts between the equipartition theorem and the measured
 specific heats of gases. For example, the experimental value of С v for monatomic
 gases, 3/2 /?, implied the absence of rotational degrees of freedom. Why should such
 molecules not rotate? "[The] theory furnishes not even a clue...."34 For gases with
 several atoms, he added, "the contradiction is even more conspicuous."35 Thus, he

 noted, for diatomic gases like nitrogen or hydrogen, the value of the specific heat (5/2
 R) was reasonable,36 but was higher for the halogens; and the specific heats of all
 diatomic gases gradually increased at high temperatures. As Nernst put it: "The the-

 ory can account for a new degree of freedom, as in the oscillation of an atom around
 its equilibrium position, but the gradual emergence of a new degree of freedom is
 (without new arbitrary assumptions) entirely senseless."37

 To apply quantum theory to rotating gas molecules, Nernst adopted the following

 strategy:

 • He argued that if a solid, thought of as a collection of masses and springs, is in
 equilibrium with a gas, then the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution will apply to
 both.

 • He quantized the solid by turning the continuous Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

 into a step function, a path that led him to Einstein's result for the specific heat, "not

 deductively from . . . statistical mechanics, but . . . transparently and visually."38

 • He then extended the argument to gases. Nernst did not quantize the rotational

 motion of a diatomic gas molecule directly, though he did not say so explicitly.
 Instead, a rotating gas molecule comes into equilibrium by exchanging harmonic-
 oscillator quanta with a solid. The rotational part of the specific heat of the gas
 falls off not because the rotational energy is quantized, but because the gas must
 be in equilibrium with a collection of quantized oscillators.

 Nernst's approach is not easy for modern readers to understand. It is nothing like the

 tack taken later by quantum theory, and Nernst was not always explicit in spelling out
 his assumptions. Nevertheless, his was the first attempt to apply quantum theory to

 36 Like Boltzmann, Nernst assumed that the degree of freedom corresponding to rotation about a line
 joining the two atoms did not appear, so that only the two rotational degrees of freedom corresponding to
 rotations about two axes through the center of mass and perpendicular to that line were present. In modern
 quantum theory, that degree of freedom does not appear because the small moment of inertia means that

 the energy of the first excited state is enormously larger than kT.

 diatomic gases; and no less a figure than Albert Einstein adopted a version of it later

 in 191 1 . Nernsťs theory is therefore worth examining in more detail.

 Like Einstein, Nernst thought of a solid as a collection of three-dimensional har-
 monic oscillators. In a thoroughly idiosyncratic derivation, he accounted for the three

 degrees of freedom of a harmonically bound mass point in a three-dimensional solid

 by projecting its orbit about its equilibrium position onto the three coordinate planes:

 [We] can so visualize the motion of a point, that we project its path onto three

 mutually perpendicular planes, whereby we obtain three "oscillation circles"
 [Schwingungskreise] ?9

 We consider one of three Schingungskreise , with which we can describe the

 motion of an atom about its equilibrium position, and we wish to assume that by
 the excitation of these oscillations, which we can think of most simply as tak-

 ing place by the collision with gas molecules, the energy will be absorbed only
 in definite quanta, and to be sure the oscillation frequency should be directly

 proportional to this quantum. . ..

 [We] will also obtain new points of view for the treatment of the energy of rota-

 tional motion, if we seek to apply the theory of energy quanta here, as will be
 discussed further below.

 Nernst continued:

 Since we at first disregard the quantum theory and make the assumption that the

 kinetic energy of the Schwingungskreise projected on a plane . . . sits in equilib-
 rium with the kinetic energy of the gas molecule projected on the same plane,
 we arrive at the second consequence, that in both cases the same distribution law
 obtains.40

 That law is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Nernst used the Maxwell-Boltzmann

 velocity distribution to derive a two-dimensional speed distribution, which he applied

 to the plane of a Schwingungskreis. He then assumed that "a gas molecule which
 crashes [anprallt] onto a rotating atom is able to take on or withdraw only the energy

 quantum e = h v."41

 Nernst made a graph of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, not in its usual form

 but as a graph of the energy of a molecule versus the number of molecules with an
 energy less than or equal to that value. The result is a monotonically increasing, con-
 cave upwards curve, representing, as he said, "a few atoms with a vanishingly small
 velocity, then a large number approaching the average velocity, and eventually a few
 atoms with a very large velocity."42

 To quantize the solid, Nernst replaced this curve with a step function, and in a der-

 ivation that looked nothing at all like Einstein's, nevertheless managed to reproduce

 (In Nernsťs notation, ß = h/kt where h and к are Planck's and Boltzmann's con-

 stants.) A derivative gave Einstein's result for the specific heat of a solid at constant

 volume. Several pages later, after a discussion of solids, Nernst returned to gases:

 We have seen above that a departure from the laws of statistical mechanics

 emerges if one concerns oneself with the rotation of atoms around an equilib-
 rium position. If we make the certainly obvious generalization of the quantum

 hypothesis, that energy always will be absorbed only in fixed quanta not only

 for an oscillation about an equilibrium position, but also for an arbitrary rotation
 of masses, then we arrive at the wider conclusion that certain contradictions of

 the old theory may perhaps be clarified. It will, for example, be understandable

 that a molecule of a monatomic gas may take on no noticeable rotation energy,
 since by the smallness of the dimension of an individual atom such a rotation

 could be identified with a Schwingungskreis of very high frequency.43

 This passage certainly sounds as if Nernst were quantizing the rotators. But it shortly

 becomes clear that he was doing nothing of the sort. He first took as an approximation
 that the rotational velocities of all gas molecules will be the same at a given temper-
 ature, even though a more complete treatment must assume a Maxwell-Boltzmann
 distribution.

 Nernst then set the oscillator frequency in Einstein's specific-heat formula equal to

 this rotator frequency, and in a step Einstein shortly corrected, set the latter propor-
 tional to the square root of the absolute temperature, as required by the equipartition
 law.

 In other words, he set ßv = a'ff in Eq. (1), and, taking a derivative, found the fol-

 lowing elaborate expression for the specific heat per degree of freedom of a rotator:44

 R я / a '

 4 Vf (e^ -l) + 'Vf (e^-l) ) 6 Г

 Nernst showed that for two degrees of freedom, this expression gave the expected

 value of R at high temperatures. It also predicted that both the rotational energy and
 specific heat fall off at low temperatures. Nevertheless, although he did not say so
 explicitly, the rotational frequency is a continuous function of temperature, and the

 rotational energy of a gas molecule is not quantized. Later in that year, in a paper writ-
 ten with Frederick Lindemann, Nernst corrected arithmetical errors in his calculation

 of the specific heat of oxygen that had been pointed out by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes,
 and stated with some satisfaction that a similar calculation for hydrogen showed a
 significant decrease in the specific heat at low temperatures.45

 3.2 Einstein, Otto Stern, Adriaan Fokker, and the unquantized quantum rotator

 The next step came in late October and early November of 191 1, when the first Sol-

 vay conference brought together about twenty of Europe's leading physicists to talk

 about the implications of the new quantum theory.46 Nernsťs report repeated his idi-
 osyncratic derivation of Einstein's result for the specific heat of solids and gave a
 detailed account of his own specific-heat measurements, but alluded only briefly to

 gases. Lorentz criticized Nernsťs Schwingungskreise , remarking that energy cannot be
 resolved into components. Lorentz's comment led to a brief discussion of the difficul-

 ties involved in applying quantum theory to systems with several degrees of freedom,
 the second time this question had come up in the discussions.47

 Einstein more than made up for Nernsťs neglect of gases. At the end of the first
 section of his report, expressing the puzzlement he still felt about how to develop
 a coherent theory of quantum behavior, he observed that "we should consider it a
 pure stroke of luck" that Planck's theory, applied to specific heats, leads to a useful

 result, and added that "totally analogous reasoning yields erroneous results in other

 cases" - his example here was the kinetic energy of a monatomic gas. He went on to

 say that:

 [We] should greet with skepticism each new application of the method of deduc-

 ing the thermal properties of matter from [Planck's] radiation formula....

 This fundamental misgiving not withstanding, one should try to apply this
 method to the rotary motion of a rigid diatomic molecule about an axis per-
 pendicular to a line connecting the atoms. ...

 I tried to solve this problem, but did not succeed because of mathematical diffi-
 culties. The solution would give us a clue to the temperature below which one

 would expect a departure of the ratio of specific heats from the value 7/5 48

 Einstein added in a footnote that Nernst had found another approach, and promised
 to return to it later. He did so in the last section of his report, where he adopted a

 corrected version of Nernsťs theory. He observed that one need only set the average

 energy of a Planck oscillator, Eq. (1), to the kinetic energy of a rotator, ^ J (In v )2
 (where J is the moment of inertia49 and v the rotational frequency of the rotator):

 "These two equations contain the relation between E and T we have been looking
 for; all that remains is to eliminate v."50 He added in a note that Nernsťs assumption

 that v was proportional to the square root of the temperature must be rejected, since it

 "could only be satisfied if the specific heat were independent of the temperature" - an

 obvious reference to equipartition. His rotators, like Nernsťs, were not quantized - the

 frequency v is a continuous function of temperature. Einstein was silent, however, on
 Nernsťs conceptual picture; in particular, he did not speak of rotators and oscillators

 exchanging energy through oscillator quanta.

 In the discussion following Einstein's report, Lorentz raised the possibility of quan-

 tizing the rotator directly by setting its kinetic energy equal to nhv , where n is an
 integer. The resulting quantized frequencies are proportional to n and the quantized
 energies to n2:

 h ? h2

 " = "2Л- Е = "2Л' ? (2)

 as Lorentz pointed out (in slightly different notation). This proposal met with little
 enthusiasm. Both Paul Langevin and Frederick Lindemann emphasized the qualita-
 tive difference between oscillators and rotators - the former has a fixed frequency of

 oscillation, the latter a variable rotational frequency - and seemed both puzzled and

 skeptical about how one might apply a theory of quanta to so different a system. Even

 Lorentz seemed to take his own suggestion with a grain of salt:

 But then, this remark is of no great significance. When applying the hypothe-

 sis of energy elements, one can confine oneself to systems for which a definite

 frequency determined by the nature of the process is given in advance.51

 Early in 1913, Einstein elaborated the sketch he had given in Brussels in a joint

 paper with his assistant Otto Stern.52 Stern had completed his Ph.D. degree in physical
 chemistry with Otto Sackur in Breslau in 1912. Sackur, in turn, had worked briefly

 with Nernst and had been deeply involved in early efforts to quantize monatomic ideal

 gases.53 Nevertheless, Stern later recalled that he had learned little quantum theory
 before he came to work with Einstein in 19 12.54

 The context was notably different from Einstein's brief sketch in Brussels. First,

 of course, Eucken's data (but not yet those of Scheel and Heuse) had been published.

 Just as important, Einstein and Stern used the specific heat of hydrogen as a probe to
 investigate Planck's new zero-point motion.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 129

 To understand this concept, we must distinguish between Planck's "first" and "sec-

 ond" quantum theories. Planck's first theory (as understood by 1913) assumed quan-
 tized energies, and energy exchange only through quanta. But in 1910, Lorentz had
 shown that unreasonably long times would be needed to absorb high-energy quanta.55

 Planck's second theory, introduced in 1911, addressed this criticism. It assumed that

 the oscillators absorbed energy continuously, but emitted energy quanta as they passed
 through the boundaries of finite phase-space cells of area h. The boundaries of those

 cells are just nhv , the energies of the quantum levels in his first theory. Planck's new

 theory called attention to the average energy of the oscillators within a given phase-

 space cell. In the cell bounded by the energies 0 and h v, that average energy was hvl 2,

 in some sense a zero-point energy - that is, the average energy of the oscillator did
 not vanish even at absolute zero.

 Einstein and Stern did not adopt Planck's second theory. But they did explore the

 implications of a zero-point energy for rotators. A zero-point energy does not affect

 the specific heat of an oscillator, since its frequency is fixed. But as Einstein and Stern

 pointed out, a zero-point energy should affect the specific heat of a rotator, since its

 frequency of rotation depends on the absolute temperature.

 Like Nernst, Einstein and Stern assumed that, "for the sake of simplicity," all rotator

 frequencies would be the same at a given temperature. And like Einstein in 191 1, they

 equated the kinetic energy of a rotator to the average energy of a resonator with the

 same frequency, adding a zero-point energy hv/ 2:

 1 л hv hv

 E = 5У(2Я„)2 л = e<„/tr _ , + (3)

 The specific heat is just the derivative of E with respect to temperature. Einstein and

 Stern calculated the specific heat of a collection of rotators, both with and without
 a zero-point energy. The calculations were tedious and the results complicated. For
 example, for the zero-point case, Einstein and Stern found that the temperature as a

 function of frequency was given by

 T = r- 7 - г-

 and the specific heat at constant volume by

 Cv = N02pv-

 1(1 (' + pvì-hì/Ap)

 where p = 2тг2 J. The equations are similar but a little simpler if the zero-point term

 is omitted. Eq. (4) is a transcendental equation in the frequency. They either solved it
 numerically, or (more likely) found by trial and error which frequencies correspond
 to the desired temperature range, and then used the resulting table of frequencies and

 temperatures to find the specific heat as a function of temperature. These equations
 do not reduce to a dimensionless form, so that one must choose a particular value for

 the moment of inertia in Eq. (4) and then see how the specific-heat curve turns out in
 Eq. (5).

 130 С. A. Gearhart

 The frequency changes slowly - it varies by only about 25 percent between 7=0
 and room temperature, and they commented that this slow variation explains why
 Eucken's fit to Einstein's 1907 harmonic-oscillator specific-heat formula, with a sin-
 gle frequency, worked as well as it did. They also pointed out that the frequency
 approaches a finite value at T = 0 for the zero-point case. These equations reveal

 clearly that the rotators are not quantized - rotation frequency and energy are contin-

 uous (if not at all classical) functions of temperature.56

 Figure 2 shows their results. The specific heat calculated without a zero-point
 energy gives an impossible result - it becomes perpendicular to the temperature axis
 at absolute zero, looking nothing like Eucken's data. By contrast, calculation with
 a the zero-point energy showed reasonable agreement - Stern and Einstein called it
 "splendid" - ironically, better than anyone else would achieve for many years.

 But how did they interpret their calculation physically? Although their treatment is

 consistent with Nernst's assumption that resonators and oscillators exchanged energy

 through oscillator quanta, Einstein and Stern were thinking along very different lines.

 In a second and almost unrelated section of their paper, they found that a zero-point

 energy combined with momentum fluctuations led to a derivation of Planck's radiation

 formula that required no quantum discontinuity.

 Energy and momentum fluctuations played a key role in Einstein's thought during

 these years, not only in Brownian motion but also in quantum theory, where he used

 fluctuations as a probe into a theory that did not yet exist. In 1909, Einstein had argued
 for a "wave-particle duality" by considering energy and momentum fluctuations in

 an electromagnetic field.57 For momentum fluctuations, he posited a moving mirror

 in a radiation field. That mirror experiences a damping force akin to friction; but it

 also experiences irregular pressure (momentum) fluctuations from the electromagnetic
 field. To maintain equilibrium, the mean-square velocity of the mirror must remain
 unchanged at the beginning and end of a short time interval r. This condition led to a

 differential equation in the energy density p , in which the damping term (right-hand
 side) is set equal to a momentum fluctuation term (left-hand side):

 А2 ЪкТ ( v dp' r t
 T' А2 - ЪкТ V' ( 35ï)/d"' v dp' r t <6>

 Here, A is the momentum fluctuation, p the radiation density, and / the area of the

 mirror. When Einstein substituted Planck's radiation law for the energy density p, he
 found

 56 The secondary literature can be misleading on this point. Some authors say Einstein and Stern quantized
 the oscillators, or omit any discussion of how their treatment is to be interpreted. For a notable exception,
 see Navarro and Pérez (2006). In the older literature, Kuhn (1978) is to my knowledge the only historian
 who says explicitly that the rotational energy is not quantized, in a brief footnote (note 29, p. 319).

 Famously, he argued that the second term on the right was a wave term traceable to

 Maxwell's equations, but that the first term was what one would expect for particles -

 his light quanta of 1905.

 A year later, Einstein and his assistant Ludwig Hopf returned to this argument, but
 from another perspective.58 This time, instead of a mirror, they considered a gas of
 Planck resonators (oscillating dipoles) in equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation.

 They calculated the momentum fluctuations directly from Maxwell's equations, and
 kept the radiation density as an unknown. Einstein's differential equation now took

 the following form:

 c2 p2 ЪкТ ( vd/Л

 The momentum-fluctuation term on the left-hand side is the same as the wave term

 in Eq. (7) from 1909; not surprisingly, the solution to this differential equation turns

 out to be the impossible Rayleigh-Jeans law,

 P = (9)

 a result that Ehrenfest later dubbed the "ultraviolet catastrophe." Einstein and Hopf 's

 derivation, as they pointed out, did not rely on the possibly dubious application of statis-

 tical methods to radiation. In particular, equipartition was used only for the translational

 motion of the resonator gas, where it seemed most secure. Thus, the Rayleigh-Jeans
 law followed directly and seemingly inescapably from the momentum fluctuations
 calculated from Maxwell's equations.

 Fluctuation arguments continued to play a central role in Einstein's thought for

 many years - they figured prominently in his A and В coefficient papers of 1916, for
 example. They appeared in this 1913 paper as well. Einstein and Stern repeated the
 Einstein-Hopf calculation of 1910, but this time included a zero-point energy h v - not
 the hv/2 from their specific-heat calculation - in the otherwise unspecified average
 resonator energy. Again, they calculated the momentum fluctuation in the resonator

 using Maxwell's laws, and set it equal to the damping term to obtain

 This time, the momentum-fluctuation term on the left-hand side is identical to the

 one Einstein had found in 1909. As one might expect, the solution to this differential

 equation is Planck's radiation law, and the average resonator energy takes on the
 familiar form

 E = ehV/HkT_ {+hv> <n)

 with, of course, the zero-point term added on. Einstein and Stern thus had derived both
 Planck's radiation law and the average resonator energy from Maxwell's equations,

 with only the additional assumption of a zero-point energy, and, as they said, "without

 recourse to any kind of discontinuities."59

 One must conclude that for a time around 1912 and 1913, Einstein had tentatively

 abandoned the quantization of material systems, and perhaps even his light quanta, in

 favor of a zero-point energy as the source of all quantum phenomena. To be sure, their

 calculation was inconsistent; Einstein and Stern had used different zero-point energies,

 hv/2 and h v respectively, to find the specific heat of hydrogen and Planck's radiation

 law. An attempt to fit the specific heat data using the larger value was unsuccessful.

 They concluded that:

 [The] zero-point energy must be set equal to Л y in order to arrive at the Planck
 radiation formula. Future investigations must show whether the discrepancy
 between this assumption and the assumption underlying the investigation of
 hydrogen [hv/2] disappears if the calculation is more rigorous.

 They added, with a touch of mystery, that "it seems doubtful that other difficulties can

 be overcome without the assumption of quanta."60

 Despite what they had called "splendid agreement" with Eucken's specific-heat

 data, Einstein soon lost confidence in zero-point motion. At the second Solvay confer-
 ence in October 1913, he alluded to unspecified "contradictions" in his and Stern's der-
 ivation of Planck's radiation law.61 A month later, in a letter to Ehrenfest in November

 1913, he wrote that the zero-point energy is "dead as a doornail" [maustot].62 Even
 earlier, in the summer of 1913, according to a student in Einstein's course in Zurich

 on the molecular theory of heat, Einstein concluded dismally that "God only knows"
 how Eucken's data are to be explained.63 But if Einstein had abandoned zero-point
 motion, he had not given up on the conceptual scheme - an unquantized rotator in
 equilibrium with a Planck radiation field. Along with a new assistant, Adriaan Fokker,
 he made one final effort at the end of 1913.

 Fluctuations had also figured prominently in Einstein's analysis of Brownian

 motion. In his first paper on Brownian motion in 1905, Einstein had derived a dif-

 fusion equation to calculate the mean-square displacements of particles suspended in

 a viscous fluid, caused by "thermal molecular motion."64 In 1906, he extended that

 treatment to the calculation of the equilibrium distribution function for any "observ-

 able parameter of a physical system."65 His method was to consider an ensemble of

 systems, and, if we call his observable parameter q , to calculate the number of "system

 points" crossing a particular value qo owing both to thermal fluctuations and to dissi-

 pative forces acting on the system. Einstein's result (which for ease of comparison I
 write using Fokker's 1914 notation) was

 W(q)f(q)T + -R2-- =0, (12)

 1 - djy

 2 d q

 where W (q) is the equilibrium distribution function (that is, the number of systems

 having a value between q and q + d q, f(q) = -dq/dt the decrease in q , and R2 the
 mean-square average change in q in the time interval г owing to random thermal pro-

 cesses. In 1906, Einstein applied this equation only to linear and angular mean-square
 displacements. He confirmed his 1905 result that the mean-square linear displace-

 ment X2 is proportional to the time, and found a similar result for mean-square angular

 displacement. Both were confirmed within the next few years by Jean Perrin.66

 Adriaan Fokker had completed his Ph.D. degree with Lorentz on the Brownian
 motion of electrons in an electromagnetic field obeying Planck's radiation law.67 He
 came to work with Einstein in Zurich in late October or early November, 1913, and

 immediately began to apply Einstein's Brownian-motion formalism to the specific
 heat of hydrogen, taking the parameter q = Leo as the angular momentum of an elec-

 tric dipole free to rotate about a fixed axis (where L is the moment of inertia and со

 the angular frequency). In this way, he could hope to find a distribution of angular
 velocities instead of assuming that all angular velocities were the same at a given

 temperature, as Einstein and Stern had done.

 Progress was swift. By early December, Fokker had a result that he described to
 Lorentz in a letter dated 4 December 1913, 68 and which he published early in 1914.69

 Although only Fokker's name is on the paper, it is evident from both Einstein's and
 Fokker's correspondence,70 as well as from Fokker's acknowledgment to Einstein at

 the end of the paper, that Einstein took a close interest in this work.

 and "means that an equal number of dipoles pass through the value q in increasing and
 decreasing direction" - the same condition Einstein had invoked in 1906. As Fokker

 noted, this equation reduces to Einstein's 1906 result if R = 0 and if R2 is not a

 function oftf.To both Einstein's and Fokker's surprise, the middle term involving R
 was needed if the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the rotators were to result from

 the Rayleigh-Jeans radiation law. With that result in hand, and with /?, R2, and f(q)
 all calculated for a rotating electric dipole in a Planck radiation field, Fokker solved

 for the distribution function W(q ), and obtained the unlikely result

 where В is a constant.

 He went on to calculate the average energy and the specific heat - as he remarked

 in his paper, "the formulas become very complex" - only to discover that his curve for

 the specific heat approached the y- axis asymptotically, much like Einstein and Stern's

 result for the case of no zero-point motion, and thus was entirely incompatible with
 Eucken's data. As he said to Lorentz, "This is the result which, of course, I would
 have liked to be different."

 Einstein was not compelled to take this path. He could easily have followed Lorentz's
 lead and quantized the rotators. The approach would have been identical to the one he

 had followed in 1907 when he used Planck's abstract quantized oscillators to calculate
 the fall in the specific heats of solids at low temperatures. He nevertheless chose not

 to quantize the rotators. His decision shows strikingly the uncertainty that pervaded
 early quantum theory. Which of Planck's two theories best described the oscillators?
 What other systems should show quantum behavior, and what sorts of laws should

 describe them? As the papers and discussion at the 1911 Solvay conference show, the
 answers were not obvious to physicists, particularly in the years before Niels Bohr
 advanced his 1913 theory of the hydrogen atom. This episode shows just how unsettled

 and uncertain the approach to quantum phenomena could be in those early years, even
 among its most enthusiastic proponents.

 4 Quantized rotators with one degree of freedom

 In May 1913, Paul Ehrenfest returned to Lorentz's suggestion, and put the theory of

 quantum rotators on the track it would take up to the present day. Ehrenfest first sum-
 marized Einstein and Stern's results, and then said that "a different kind of calculation"

 leads to the conclusion that "the snuggling up [anschmiegen] . . . to the horizontal axis

 at Г = 0 to infinitely high order can be accomplished entirely without the introduction

 of a zero-point energy."71 He did not otherwise draw attention to the very different

 nature of his calculation, but proceeded, citing Lorentz, to quantize both the rotational

 frequency and the energy of a rotator through the equations

 1 о hv
 -J(2nv) = n - , n =0,1,2,...
 2 2

 => s„ = X-]{2nvf - <l6>

 He commented enigmatically that his factor of 2 in the first equation could be justified

 "from a very general standpoint" - the first announcement of his adiabatic hypothesis,

 which was to become a key tool in early quantum theory.72

 Ehrenfest used a phase-space analysis (analogous to Planck's treatment in 1906
 for an oscillator) to argue that each energy state was equally probable. He went on to

 calculate the specific heat, using a then developing and now standard technique, by

 first writing the equation

 Q = ^e-£"/ir, (17)

 oo

 n= 0

 and then showing that the rotational part of the specific heat is given by

 2d2 In 0(a) h2

 cs = 2m<, „ = 5^5^. (18)

 The factor of 2 was added arbitrarily to take into account the two rotational degrees of

 freedom of the rigid rotator (see Fig. 1). Before 1915, quantum theorists did not know
 how to treat problems with more than one degree of freedom. Ehrenfesťs way out
 of this dilemma had always worked satisfactorily for classical ideal gases, and might
 have seemed reasonable in 1913. Later on, it would not.

 Fig. 3 Specific heat curves of Ehrenfest (1913) and Holm (1913). Ehrenfest's curve goes through a mini-
 mum around 500 К before rising slowly to the equipartition value

 absolute temperature T (K)

 Q is today called the partition function in English textbooks, and the Zustandsumme

 in German ones.73 Ehrenfest gave it the symbol Q and did not call it anything.74 He
 would have seen it in both Boltzmann (whose student he had been) and Gibbs,75 and

 later, in the calculation of average energy and specific heat of a harmonic oscillator

 by both Planck and Einstein.76 For the harmonic oscillator Q reduces to a geometric
 series and so is easily summed. No such closed form exists for Ehrenfest's rotator; and

 for small о (high temperatures), the sum converges slowly and hence numerical cal-

 culations are awkward.77 Ehrenfest sidestepped this problem with the use of a special
 function, the Jacobean theta function, which transforms о into its inverse.

 Ehrenfest's graph is shown in Fig. 3. He chose the moment of inertia so that his curve

 matched the data at low temperatures.78 His curve reaches a peak around 200 K, goes

 73 Each term in the partition function is proportional to the probability of finding the system in a particular

 quantum state, as a function of temperature. It is straightforward to derive thermal quantities, including the

 specific heat, from appropriate derivatives of the partition function; see for example Reif (1965, Chapters
 6, 7).

 74 Planck, who used the same quantity throughout the 1910s, started using the now-standard symbol Z
 and the name Zustandsumme around 1 92 1 , and is often given credit for both. However, Peter Debye (1914,
 for example p. 27) used both as early as 1914. One still sometimes sees the partition function called Q ,
 particularly in texts written by physical chemists.

 75 Boltzmann and Gibbs both use this quantity as a normalizing factor in what Boltzmann called a holode,
 and Gibbs a canonical ensemble. See Boltzmann (1884-1885, Sect. 3), and Gibbs (1902, Chapter IV).
 . Gibbs also discusses its relation to thermal averages.

 76 Planck (1914a, p. 86), Einstein (1907).

 77 As temperatures approach the equipartition limit at room temperatures or above, the sum goes over to an
 integral and is once again fairly easy to calculate. But at intermediate temperatures, the slow convergence
 of the series made the calculations a challenge, in the days before computers and sophisticated calculators.

 78 This technique was universally adopted subsequently; different moments of inertia merely shifted the
 curve along the temperature axis.

 through a minimum, and only approaches the equipartition value at temperatures well

 above 500 K. Similar peaks were to plague theorists for almost fifteen years. Ehrenfest
 said only a little about it - his emphasis was on showing that he could reproduce the

 low-temperature behavior without resorting to a zero-point energy. Ehrenfesťs paper

 led Einstein to suggest calculating the specific heat using both quantized energy levels

 and a zero-point term - it seems that he had not quite given up on zero-point motion
 after all.79

 Still later in 1913, Eric Holm, a new Swedish Ph.D. and former mining engineer,
 applied Ehrenfesťs technique to Planck's second theory.80 In his calculation, Holm
 replaced quantized energy levels with the average energy of a rotator in a phase-
 space cell, much as Planck had done in his second theory for resonators. In particular,
 for a cell bounded by the levels n - 1 and n , and assuming that an ensemble of
 N rotators was uniformly distributed within each cell, he found an average energy

 en = h2/Sn2J(n2 - n + ^), and remarked on the presence of a zero-point energy
 for the lowest energy cell. He substituted this result into Ehrenfesťs partition function

 ß, Eq. (17), and calculated the specific heat. Like Ehrenfest, he multiplied his result
 by 2 to take into account both degrees of freedom, and used a theta function (albeit
 a different form) to finesse the slow convergence of the partition series. The result

 was the graph shown in Fig. 3. As Holm pointed out, the peak is no longer present.
 Nevertheless, his curve (like Ehrenfesťs) lies well above the data at 200 K, and comes

 too high at room temperature.

 Peter Debye, who had been working independently along the same lines as Ehren-
 fest, summarized these developments about a year later, in his lectures on quantum

 theory in Göttingen in the winter term 1914-1 5. 81 His typed lecture notes devote more

 than 20 pages to the rigid rotator and its application to both the specific heat of hydro-

 gen and molecular spectra, suggesting the interest that these topics had aroused among

 quantum theorists. He carefully analyzed Einstein and Stern's results, simplifying the
 calculations through well-chosen approximations and series expansions. In the end,

 though, he pronounced their theory "unsatisfactory." "By what right can one without

 further ado set the kinetic energy of a rotating particle equal to the oscillation energy
 of a resonator...?" Debye also was wary of Ehrenfesťs and Holm's calculations. He
 summarized Ehrenfesťs calculation carefully, noting that he had been working along
 similar lines himself. Nevertheless, he called attention to Ehrenfesťs "hump," noting

 that it was not at all in agreement with the data. Holm, he added, had eliminated the

 unacceptable hump. Nevertheless, he suggested, the recent discovery of sharp rota-
 tional peaks in infrared molecular spectra cast doubt on Planck's second theory. (I shall
 return to this theme later.) The next step, he concluded, was to seek a better theoretical

 curve for the specific heat.

 79 Einstein to Ehrenfest, 8 July 1914, in Einstein (1987-2009, Vol. 8, Doc. 19). Ehrenfest probably never
 carried out this suggestion. Had he done so, a Mathematica calculation shows that his peak would have
 disappeared.

 Thus, by early 1914, Einstein's approach had dropped from sight. Einstein himself

 had abandoned it, and no one else had adopted it. Two calculations using the parti-
 tion function had appeared, based respectively on Planck's first and second theories.
 Both used only one degree of freedom. Each was in qualitative agreement with the
 specific-heat data, but each failed quantitatively at intermediate and high tempera-
 tures. Debye was not the only skeptic. Erwin Schrödinger sounded similarly unim-
 pressed towards the end of a two-part review article on specific heats published in Die
 Naturwissenschaften late in 1917.82 An accurate quantum description remained out
 of reach.

 5 Max Planck, Arnold Sommerfeld, and rotators with multiple

 degrees of freedom

 Max Planck was following these developments with considerable interest. In a Decem-

 ber 1914 letter to Ehrenfest, he said that "we possess with the problem of the rotating

 dipoles a highly important gate of entry into the heart [Innere] of the quantum hypothe-

 sis." In another letter to Ehrenfest the following March, Planck announced his intention

 to offer two complementary derivations, one "thermodynamic," the other "electrody-
 namic."83 The former was the derivation that Erik Holm had already published; when

 Planck came across it in April, he decided to publish only his "electromagnetic" deri-

 vation, in which he used a modified version of Fokker's 1914 approach, investigating
 fluctuations in a rotator in equilibrium with a radiation field. But unlike Fokker, Planck

 used his second quantum theory and required that Fokker's damping term be nonzero
 only on the boundaries of the finite phase-space cells. The result of his calculation
 was identical to Holm's (and his own) "thermodynamic" derivation, much to Planck's
 satisfaction. Neither this calculation nor Planck's later work with what became known

 as the Fokker-Planck equation seems to have influenced quantum theory significantly,

 though as Alan Needell has shown, they did play an important role in the development
 of Planck's thought.84

 As it turned out, Planck had bigger fish to fry. Henri Poincaré, at the first Solvay

 conference in 191 1, had asked how one should treat quantum systems with more than
 one degree of freedom. In a series of three papers submitted in November and Decem-

 ber of 1915, Planck provided one answer, which he immediately applied to the rotator
 and the specific heat of hydrogen.85

 of Maxwellian electrodynamics in quantum theory; see Needell (1980) for further discussion. In 1917,
 Planck (1917a) even published the first proof of the Fokker-Planck equation, which has since become a

 staple in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and stochastic theory. See for example Huang (2001 , Chapter
 18), or Reif (1965, Chapter 15).

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 1 39

 In 1906, Planck had shown that his one-dimensional quantum resonators could be

 described by a "surface" of constant energy in phase space.86 The constant energy U

 of a resonator, given by

 p2 1 9

 u = Ък + 2kq ' (19)

 describes an ellipse in this two-dimensional phase space. If these ellipses are specified

 by Planck's quantum condition, U = nhv, then the area of a phase-space cell bounded

 by successive values of n is just A, Planck's constant. The size of this cell is propor-
 tional to the probability of finding an oscillator in a particular cell (or on a particular

 boundary). This result justified Planck's assumption, which had seemed so mysterious
 to him in 1900, that all complexions (or "microstates") are equally probable.87

 In these 1915 papers, Planck extended his treatment to several degrees of freedom.
 He envisioned a multi-dimensional phase space divided into finite cells by "hypersur-

 faces" that determine both quantum conditions and the "volume" of finite phase-space

 cells. These hypersurfaces are in turn related to the constants of the motion (including,

 of course, the energy), determined by the classical Hamiltonian of the particular sys-
 tem under consideration. The quantum condition is imposed by finding the functional

 form of each hypersurface g/, and then setting g¡ = n/A, where the n, are integers.
 Moreover, the volumes of these phase-space cells are not equal, and so are associated

 with different probabilities.

 Planck stated that this prescription can be applied to either his first or second

 theory, though, not surprisingly, his examples are mostly drawn from the latter. In
 his second paper, he distinguished between what he called "coherent" and "incoher-
 ent" degrees of freedom. Edwin P. Adams in his 1920 text gave a clear, qualitative
 description:

 In general, each degree of freedom furnishes one hypersurface; but it often
 happens that two or more degrees of freedom lead to the same hypersurface.
 Such degrees of freedom, with common hypersurfaces, Planck calls "coherent"

 degrees of freedom.88

 Planck himself put it this way:

 It is characteristic of the quantum hypothesis, in opposition to the classical the-

 ory, that the elementary domains of probability possess a definite form and size;
 in particular, their boundaries will be defined by certain (2/ - 1) dimensional
 hypersurfaces. Their determination constitutes the most important but also the
 most difficult part of the problem. The simplest case is the one in which these

 hypersurfaces are simultaneously the surfaces of constant energy....89

 Planck took the rigid rotator and the specific heat of hydrogen as his first example

 of a system with two coherent degrees of freedom; it is even possible that this problem

 motivated his new theory. As a first step, he applied his scheme to a rotator with only

 one degree of freedom, and successfully reproduced Holm's result. He then repeated
 the calculation for a rigid rotator with two degrees of freedom (/ = 2). The average

 energy within a cell turns out to be

 The size of the corresponding phase-space cell and the related probability pn of finding
 a molecule in that cell are

 G„ = {(л + l)2 -n2)h2 = (2/1 + ')h2 and p„=2n + '. (22)

 Thus, unlike the case for one degree of freedom, the phase-space cells are not all the
 same size. Therefore, the partition function is not just a sum of Boltzmann factors;
 rather, each term is "weighted" by the probability appropriate to a given cell.

 These "weights" are a characteristic feature of problems with several degrees of
 freedom. They explain why Ehrenfesťs scheme - simply multiplying the one-dimen-
 sional result by two, for two rotational degrees of freedom - could not work, and

 why, therefore, Planck's (and shortly thereafter, Sommerfeld's) generalization was so
 important. [Compare, in this respect, Eqs. (23) and (17).]

 Planck wrote his result in terms of his "thermodynamic potential" (the free energy

 divided by temperature) which is readily recognized as the logarithm of the partition
 function:

 The specific heat is, as before, the second derivative. Planck found the correct limiting
 behavior (0 and R at low and high temperatures, respectively). But the calculations
 for intermediate temperatures were even more difficult than those of Ehrenfest and

 Holm. Planck noted: "Unfortunately, the sum does not reduce so simply to a Jacobean
 theta function.. . Z'90 He did not make a graph.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 141

 In 191 8, Sophie Rotszajn treated the specific heat of hydrogen using Planck's phase-

 space theory, with the same continuous energies, in a long paper that also used the

 rigid rotator to treat paramagnetism. By placing her rotator (here a magnetic dipole)

 in a magnetic field, she was able to find a solution with "incoherent" degrees of free-

 dom - that is, her hypersurfaces were determined by two constants of the motion, one

 of which was the energy, and each hypersurface had a separate quantum condition.

 Her results were notably different from Planck's.91

 Late in 1 9 1 5 , at the same time that Planck's papers were appearing, Arnold Sommer-

 feld introduced a second method for treating systems with several degrees of freedom.
 He postulated that for each degree of freedom, the "phase integral" around a closed

 path in phase space should be a multiple of Planck's constant:

 j) pdq = nh, (24)

 where the p and q are, respectively, the generalized momenta and coordinates. This

 condition picked out the permitted quantum states (in the spirit of Planck's first the-

 ory) from the infinity of classical ones. Although William Wilson in England and Jun

 Ishiwara in Japan had independently made the same suggestion, Sommerfeld showed

 how to apply it to the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum, and thus turned it into a

 fruitful and widely used tool.92 Ehrenfest and his student Johannes Burgers explored
 the implications of Ehrenfest' s adiabatic hypothesis. And Sommerfeld's former stu-
 dent Paul Epstein and the astronomer Karl Schwarzschild showed how to apply the
 Hamilton- Jacobi formulation of classical mechanics - hitherto restricted primarily to
 astronomers, though it has since become a staple of classical mechanics textbooks.

 The result, by the end of 1916, was a systematic and at first highly successful approach

 to quantization.93

 In brief, one wrote down the Hamiltonian for a system, used Hamilton-Jacobi

 theory to separate the variables, and then applied the quantization condition, Eq. (24),
 separately to each degree of freedom. For problems with more than one degree of
 freedom, it sometimes happens, much as in modern quantum mechanics, that more

 than one quantum state (or set of quantum numbers) has the same energy. One speaks

 of "degenerate" quantum states - several different quantum states corresponding to
 the same energy. It turns out that the number of degenerate states in Sommerfeld's
 approach played the same role as the volume of phase space in Planck's formulation.

 91 Rotszajn (1918). Rotszajn was born in 1873, according to Einstein (1987-2009, Vol. 9, Doc. 131). This
 paper was her Ph.D. dissertation with Simon Ratnowski in Zurich. I have been unable to learn anything
 more about her. I discuss her work in more detail in Sect. 5. 1 . See also footnote 98.

 92 In his third paper, Planck (1916) alluded to Sommerfeld's work and showed that his theory of multidi-
 mensional phase-space cells could also treat this problem.

 93 For discussion and bibliography, including full citations of the work described in this paragraph, see for
 example Jammer (1966-1989, Chapter 3, Sect. 1). See also Shore (2003); Navarro and Pérez (2006), and
 Pérez (2009). As Jammer points out, physicists soon showed that Planck's and Sommerfeld's quantization
 conditions were mathematically equivalent. For a detailed treatment, see for example Sommerfeld (1922,
 1924, esp. the section "Mathematical Notes and Addenda"), and Goldstein (1959, esp. Chapters. 8, 9).

 5.1 Fritz Reiche and the specific heat of hydrogen

 In 1919, Fritz Reiche took up the specific heat of hydrogen. Reiche had earned his
 Ph.D. with Planck in 1907 and went on to spend several years in Breslau working with

 Otto Lummer, in a less than successful attempt to gain a background in experimen-
 tal physics. There he met Max Born, who spoke of him with affection and recalled

 learning a great deal of quantum theory and relativity from him.94 Reiche returned to

 Berlin in 191 1, and in 1913 became a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin. From
 1915 to 1918, he worked as an assistant to Planck - in an interview in 1962, he said

 that initially he "was not strong enough" to be drafted into the military; later he was
 classified as "capable of doing work in a bureau." In 1919-1920, he was an advisor
 to Fritz Haber's Physical Chemistry Institute in Berlin, where, he later recalled, he

 was known as the "little oracle," in contrast to the "big oracle," Albert Einstein, with
 whom he became acquainted during these years.95 In 1921, he became Professor in
 Breslau, and in the same year published a widely read textbook on quantum theory.96

 Reiche first took up the rotator late in 1917, in an investigation of paramagne-

 tism.97 His paper seems to have been motivated by Jan von Weyssenhoff, a student

 of Simon Ratnowski in Zurich, who in his 1916 Ph.D. dissertation had repeated Erik
 Holm's calculation, but had also used a rigid rotator with one degree of freedom to

 study paramagnetism.98 Reiche proposed to use a rotator with two degrees of freedom.
 Reiche employed Planck's second theory, but used the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism -

 the resulting quantized energies also specify Planck's hypersurfaces in phase space.
 Following Sommerfeld's now-standard prescription, Reiche wrote down the familiar

 Hamiltonian for the rigid rotator, separated it with the Hamilton-Jacobi equations,

 and then applied Sommerfeld's quantum condition, Eq. (24), to both of the resulting
 components of angular momentum.

 These developments set the stage for Reiche's detailed and influential 1919 paper

 on the specific heat of hydrogen.99 He began by summarizing earlier developments:
 Ehrenfest, Holm, and von Weyssenhoff had calculated the specific heat assuming
 one degree of freedom. Paul Epstein100 and Adolf Smekal (in an unpublished work)
 had done so on the basis of Bohr's 1913 model of the hydrogen molecule. Finally,
 Planck and Sophie Rotszajn had done so with Planck's second theory and two degrees

 see for example Holm (1915); Smekal (1918), and Rotszajn (1918). Nevertheless, these theories of para-
 magnetism do not appear to have attracted much attention. Reiche (1921) does not so much as mention them

 in his textbook. See also Van Vleck (1932, Chapters I-V; for a negative comment on these early efforts, see
 p. 303).

 of freedom, using coherent and incoherent degrees of freedom respectively. Reiche
 announced that he would do the same calculation for two degrees of freedom, but

 using Planck's first theory.

 Reiche noted that the motion consisted of a rotation about the center of mass with

 constant angular velocity, in a plane fixed in space. Therefore, "in spite of the two

 degrees of freedom, the probability of a state is determined by a single quantity, the

 energy, and thus we have to deal with a 'degenerate problem'." Such degenerate prob-

 lems, as he pointed out, could present ambiguities.101 Hence, to find the energy of his

 degenerate rotator, he first referred readers to his 1917 treatment, where he had lifted

 the degeneracy by treating a rotating magnetic dipole in a magnetic field, and then

 allowing the field to go to zero; but he also did a second derivation for a "symmetric

 rotator" (three degrees of freedom; see Fig. 1) in a gravitational field, again taking the

 appropriate limiting case. Both methods gave the same result for the rotator energy,

 Wn',ri2 = (^i ~b ' (25)

 2

 where n' and л 2 are integer quantum numbers corresponding to the two degrees of

 freedom. He next calculated the partition function. Like Ehrenfest, he used the symbol

 Q but did not give it a name. Assuming that each quantum state was equally probable,
 he wrote

 ß = XXe_Wn|'"2Ar = SSe_<T("l+"2)2 Where a = 8л-2 jkT' (26)

 Л1 П2 n' П2

 Q = ^(2n + ')e-a"' (27)

 00

 n= 0

 Note that the "weight" in this equation, 2n + 1 , represents the number of degenerate

 states for a given energy, and is the same as Planck's weight, Eq. (23), derived from
 the volume of a phase-space cell.

 Reiche went on to calculate the specific heat using Eq. (18). As Planck had already
 discovered, the numerical calculations were not simple. The sum in Eq. (27) does not

 converge in closed form, and no transformations of the sort Ehrenfest and Holm had
 used could be found. Reiche responded with brute force. He seems to have taken the
 sum out to n = 5 (either five or six terms, depending on the model),102 and showed

 that Eqs. (27) and (18) lead to

 negative rotations should be counted separately, that one obtains the single sum

 absolute temperature T (K)

 where x = e_(T. I suspect that this form was chosen for ease of calculation. Even
 so, the arithmetic is staggering. In Eq. (28), Reiche had to divide a nine-term poly-
 nomial f(x) by a 13-term g(x). He then made a table of specific heats versus 1/a,

 found a value of the moment of inertia that led to good agreement with the data at the
 lowest temperatures and, finally, made a table of specific heats versus temperature.
 He repeated this procedure for five additional cases. Simple mechanical calculators

 were in use early in the twentieth century, so it is possible that Reiche might have had
 one available to him. It is equally possible that he had only a slide rule and a table of

 logarithms. Either way, it was a formidable calculation.

 Reiche's results are shown in Fig. 4. The result from the calculation described
 above, Reiche's Curve I, has a peak higher and broader than Ehrenfest's. Reiche's
 response was unconditional: "we must throw it out." But what was wrong? Perhaps
 it was the degeneracy levels - perhaps, for example, one should not count positive
 and negative rotations as separate states, so that the weight in Eq. (27) became n -f 1

 instead of 2n + 1. The qualitative shape of the resulting curve (not shown in Fig. 4)
 was unchanged.

 Reiche went on to consider more sweeping special assumptions. "One might there-

 fore make the hypothesis that the rotationless state . . . does not exist; that is, one forbids

 the quantum state n = n' + П2 = О".103 Zero-point energies thus appeared in the
 context of Planck's first theory, as Reiche pointed out. The resulting graph, his Curve
 III, is shown in Fig. 4. Encouragingly, the peak was gone. However, the curve came
 in much too low at room temperatures.104

 103 Reiche (1919, p. 674).

 104 Both Curve I and Curve III eventually approach the equipartition value, but only at temperatures con-
 siderably above room temperature, contrary to experiment.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 145

 Reiche was not finished, however. He next took up an even stranger special case:

 "Consider a possible if also quite artificial modification. It consists therein, that one
 forbids not only the quantum state n = n' -1- П2 = 0, but also all states for which
 П2 = O."105 This "quite artificial modification" amounts to an arbitrary restriction on

 the plane of rotation: Reiche was reduced to introducing a weak vertical gravitational

 field; his condition then implies that the dumbbell cannot rotate in a plane passing

 through this vertical direction (or to put it another way, the angular-momentum vector

 cannot be perpendicular to the vertical).106 This assumption led to

 Q = ^ne-"2" (29)

 and to Reiche's Curve V, also shown in Fig. 4. Widely cited in the ensuing literature,

 it matched the data well at high and low temperatures, and was the best that anyone
 was able to do for many years. But as Reiche pointed out in no uncertain terms, it
 was significantly too high at 200 K, where "the double measurement of Eucken and
 Scheel-Heuse has a special certainty."107

 Reiche remembered the discrepancy clearly in his 1962 interview with Thomas S.

 Kuhn, when he remarked:

 And this was the idea, that one tried different ideas for the statistical weights. ...
 One of them was, for instance, that one made the zero state nonexistent. There

 is always a rotation. . . . This also I think eliminated at least the maxima and
 minima, but it did not give the correct curve anyway. ...

 And so I tried different curves and I think the best still was the curve, number

 five. But even this was not good

 bly below, terribly far off. Nevertheless, at the end of my paper I was careful. I

 left it open. ... Later Eucken was in Breslau for a long time, and I was very much

 in touch with him. But I'm pretty sure that at that time, I asked him about the

 reliability of this deviating point .... And I am pretty sure he said that the point
 cannot be that far off, it cannot be lifted to such an extent.108

 Reiche's paper concluded with an analysis of Planck's second theory. He gave the
 first published graph of the result Planck had derived in 1915 for coherent degrees of

 freedom (Fig. 4). It had a peak that was wider and broader than even Reiche's Curve I.
 Reiche also pointed out that Sophie Rotszajn's result, employing incoherent degrees
 of freedom, was identical to his own Curve V. It is entirely possible that he was led to

 seek out Eq. (29) in the context of Planck's first theory after having seen it in her paper.

 Rotszajn had found a way to use special functions to evaluate her specific heat; but her

 106 Reiche (1919, p. 680). gave this explanation at the beginning of Sect. 9, and again in the conclusion.
 For another clearly stated version of this argument, see Herzfeld (1925, p. 384). The field must be weak to

 have a negligible effect on the energy of the dumbbell, a point Herzfeld makes explicitly.

 graph was small and uninformative. She did not plot the data, and less surprisingly,

 did not plot Planck's curve. Reiche was thus the first to publish careful graphs of both

 options for Planck's theory, and to compare them to the data.

 The upshot was that none of Reiche's curves worked well, and the best of them

 was the least plausible theoretically, despite a systematic and rigorous treatment that
 left no possibility unmentioned. Even worse, as he pointed out both in this article
 and, in a different connection in his 1921 textbook, the models for the specific heat

 of hydrogen could not answer "one of the most fundamental questions of the whole

 quantum theory, whether, namely, Planck's first or second theory is correct."109

 Reiche's paper was so thorough, and the physics of the quantum rotator so straight-
 forward, that it was not clear what could be done to improve matters, however
 unsatisfactory the results. The problem continued to be widely discussed, and other
 possibilities were eventually pursued. Nevertheless, Max Born, whose 1925 textbook

 treated most of the unresolved problems in quantum theory at great length, dismissed
 the specific heat of hydrogen with a few summary paragraphs and a reference to
 Reiche's 1919 paper.1 10 A seemingly elementary problem - applying the rigid rotator
 to the specific heat of hydrogen - still had no satisfactory solution.

 5.2 Niels Bohr and the specific heat of hydrogen

 Unknown to Reiche, Niels Bohr had tackled the specific heat of hydrogen 3 years
 earlier, in 1916, in perhaps the most famous unpublished paper in the history of phys-
 ics - Bohr withdrew it at the last moment after he had seen Sommerfeld's treatment of

 the fine structure of the hydrogen atom.11 1 Bohr's paper took up a number of themes
 that were to figure in his later work, among them Ehrenfest's adiabatic hypothesis
 and early intimations of what became the correspondence principle. But Bohr also
 analyzed a rigid rotator with two degrees of freedom, and applied it to both molecular

 spectra and the specific heat of hydrogen.

 Bohr began his treatment of the latter by arguing that any periodic system with

 one degree of freedom should have equally probable quantum states - a generaliza-
 tion based on Planck's 1906 treatment of an oscillator with finite phase-space cells
 of size h. But this scheme could not be extended to systems with multiple degrees
 of freedom by treating each degree of freedom separately, as Ehrenfest had done,
 since the quantization condition "is not satisfied for the different degrees of freedom
 separately, but for the whole system." Instead, he argued, one must consider that the
 state of a system with r degrees of freedom will "lie upon a series of 2r - 1 dimen-
 sional surfaces with constant energy" in phase space.1 12 He could not find the volume
 of phase space enclosed by such a system of surfaces, but argued that dimensional

 considerations allowed one to conclude that the volume of phase space Q bounded by

 surfaces corresponding to the quantum number n was

 Q = C(nh)r

 where С is a constant that depends on the particular system. For a rotator its value was

 one, as he stated without proof.1 13

 This expression is similar to Planck's expression for the volume of phase space,
 Eq. (20). But Bohr's physical interpretation was markedly different - he was not think-

 ing of finite cells. Instead, he noted that "ordinary statistical mechanics" should apply

 in the case of large л , and hence in this limit he can show that the probability of finding

 the rotator in the nth state, corresponding to the quantum number n, is proportional to

 dQ/dn. Bohr then assumed, in what seems to be an early example of the correspon-

 dence principle, that this result holds "not only in the limit but for any value of и."1 14

 Hence the probability, or "weight," of finding a rotator in the nth state is proportional to

 nr~l = n for r - 2.

 This weight leads directly to Reiche's Eq. (29); hence Bohr's result was identical to
 Reiche's Curve V! Like Reiche, he remarked on the presence of a zero-point energy

 and went on to say:

 This so-called zero-point energy has here an origin quite distinct from that in

 Planck's theory. In the present theory, it arises from the fact, that . . . there is no

 probability of a periodic system of several degrees of freedom being in the state
 corresponding to n = 0.115

 Bohr tells us that he had come across Planck's 1915 theory after his own had been

 worked out. He observed that their very different predictions for the specific heat of

 hydrogen might make it possible to distinguish between Planck's first and second theo-

 ries, "which differ so widely in their physical meaning." His brief discussion, however,

 focused on the contrast between his quantized energy states and the continuous ener-

 gies found in Planck's second theory, rather than on the very different character of

 their phase-space cells and, consequently, the different ways in which they had used
 a multidimensional phase space for weights and probability calculations. Bohr made
 graphs of both his specific-heat curve and Planck's (see Fig. 4), and remarked that
 his curve agreed much better with the data, though like Reiche he pointed out the
 discrepancy around 200 K, and raised the possibility of experimental error.

 113 The notation here can be confusing: Bohr used Q for the volume of phase space, not the partition
 function. He nevertheless calculated the specific heat in much the same way as Ehrenfest had done.

 1 14 Bohr (1916, p. 277)In statistical mechanics, the probability of finding a system in a state n is propor-
 tional to the volume of a shell of phase space bounded by n and n + in this case ( dQ/dn)Sn , as Bohr
 pointed out. Such infinitesimal phase-space cells are typical of (as Bohr put it) "ordinary [i.e., classical!
 statistical mechanics" but are of course quite different from Planck's finite cells.

 5.3 Edwin С. Kemble, the specific heat of hydrogen, and molecular spectra

 The American physicist Edwin C. Kemble also had taken on the specific heat of
 hydrogen, in his 1917 Ph.D. dissertation. For Kemble, however, that topic was almost

 a sidelight - his primary interest lay in the vibration-rotation spectrum of diatomic
 gases such as HCl. In contrast to Reiche and Bohr, who worked with rigid rotators,
 Kemble took as central, for both molecular spectra and the specific heat of hydro-

 gen, the picture of a dumbbell that not only rotated about its center of mass, but also
 vibrated along a line joining the two nuclei. Kemble's work thus gives us an oppor-
 tunity to examine the close connection that he and other physicists drew between the

 two problems.116

 Kemble began graduate school at Harvard in 1913. He had become interested in

 quantum theory, in which, he discovered, none of the faculty had much expertise.

 Nevertheless, with the support of his advisor, Percy W. Bridgman, Kemble pursued a

 dissertation on the quantum theory of two molecular topics: the specific heat of hydro-

 gen and the vibration-rotation absorption spectrum of diatomic molecules, particu-
 larly HCl. In another innovation for Harvard, his dissertation was largely theoretical ,

 although the physics faculty did insist that it include an experimental component.117

 Kemble had to struggle with a host of difficult theoretical questions without the guid-
 ance that European students received from such advisors as Sommerfeld and Born, or

 that Kemble himself provided for such later students at Harvard as John H. Van Vleck
 and John C. Slater.

 After a short introduction, Kemble began his dissertation by outlining Planck's 1915

 theory of multidimensional phase-space cells and its application to the specific heat of

 hydrogen. He was every bit as thorough as Reiche would be 2 years later. After review-
 ing Planck's theory, he developed a calculational scheme similar to Reiche's - again,
 the numerical calculations must have been daunting - and used it to make a graph of
 Planck's curve, commenting tartly on Planck's failure to do so. Like Reiche and Bohr,

 Kemble found the high, broad peak shown in Fig. 4. He immediately rejected it, and
 with it Planck's second theory. He was already disposed to reject Planck's continu-
 ous energies. Sharp absorption peaks in infra-red molecular absorption bands118 led
 Kemble to assume that only discrete, quantized rotational states were possible. Hence
 Planck's second theory could not be correct.

 Kemble, therefore, settled on Planck's first theory, and concluded that allowed states

 must be limited to the energy hypersurfaces. His calculation for this case was similar to

 Reiche's, and not surprisingly he reproduced Reiche's Curve I, which he also rejected.
 But unlike Reiche, Kemble used Planck's finite multidimensional phase-space cells
 to calculate his weights. Delivery of the Annalen der Physik to the United States had

 been interrupted by the Great War, and as a result, as Kemble later explained, he had
 not seen Sommerfeld's 1916 Annalen paper in which he introduced Eq. (24) to treat

 1 16 Kemble (1917). I discuss these connections briefly in this section and in more detail in Sect. 6.

 117 For more on Kemble, see Assmus (1991, 1992a,b, 1999), Holton (1988), and Sopka (1988). See also
 Thomas S. Kuhn, interview with E. C. Kemble, May 1962, AHQP.

 1 18 Under low resolution, molecular spectra often appear as continuous "bands" rather than discrete lines.

 It is common to refer to molecular "band spectra" even when higher resolution shows the discrete lines.

 problems with several degrees of freedom.119 Planck's approach, therefore, was the
 only one available, and Kemble's use of it was bold and innovative.

 Kemble's next step was to leave out the ground state in the partition function. In this
 way, he was led - like Reiche and Bohr - to the explicit assumption of a zero-point
 energy. His choice was reinforced by his work on molecular spectroscopy, which also
 led him to conclude that rotation-free states in diatomic molecules were forbidden.

 Kemble pointed out that a zero-point energy would add an additional complication

 to the calculations of the specific heat: if energies are on the hyperspace boundaries,
 and the n = 0 case is rejected, which phase-space cell should be chosen to calcu-
 late the weight in the partition function? The cell bounding the state from below?

 From above? Or perhaps an average of the two? Kemble considered all three. The first
 choice yielded an impossible result. The second and third yielded results identical
 to Reiche's Curve III and Curve V, respectively - in Kemble's dissertation they were
 labeled Curve С and Curve E.

 Unlike Reiche, Kemble found it difficult to decide between them - and here again

 his interest in molecular spectra came into play. Theories of molecular spectra require a

 rotator that vibrates along a line connecting the two nuclei. The consequent interaction
 of vibration and rotation leads to complications; for example:

 • The rotator can stretch as it rotates faster. The moment of inertia increases, and

 hence the spacing of higher rotational energy levels decreases (Eq. 16). Those
 higher energy levels are thus easier to excite, and can, therefore, lead to higher
 specific heats at a given temperature. This effect is accentuated if the vibrational
 potential energy is anharmonic; and Kemble was among the first to show how
 molecular spectra provide evidence for anharmonic oscillations.

 • Vibrational degrees of freedom should contribute to the specific heat of diatomic

 gases when excitation energies become comparable to kT.

 Kemble understood these possibilities clearly from his work on molecular spectra. But

 their relative importance in 1917 and for some years thereafter, particularly for the

 specific heat of hydrogen, was far from clear, either theoretically or experimentally.
 Kemble struggled with both of them. At different times, he thought it possible that
 either or both of these effects might raise his Curve С (Reiche's Curve III) closer to
 the equipartition value at room temperatures. Thus the choice between his Curve С
 and Curve E was not obvious.

 Thus, at the end of his treatment of the specific heat of hydrogen early in his the-
 sis, Kemble said that both curves argued strongly for a zero-point energy. He leaned

 tentatively toward Curve E, although he pointed out the "considerable error in the

 experimental value" around 200 K. He also noted the possibility that the excitation of
 a vibrational degree of freedom starting around 260 К might raise Curve С at higher

 temperatures, although he thought it unlikely. His summary at the end of his thesis
 was neutral, though he did comment on the need for better specific-heat data.120

 seemed most consistent with the absorption spectra of HCl.

 However, in an abstract for a paper given at an American Physical Society (APS)

 meeting later in 1917, Kemble settled firmly on his Curve С (Reiche's Curve III). He

 assumed "as a first approximation" a harmonic restoring force and argued, in a notable

 change from his dissertation, that an increase in the moment of inertia of the hydrogen

 molecule - a possibility not mentioned in his dissertation - is sufficient to bring the

 upper end of Curve С into agreement with the observations near room temperature. His

 graph (unlike the one in his thesis, which stops at room temperature) shows a steady

 increase in the specific heat from room temperature up to about 550 K, and begins to
 exceed the equipartition result at about 400 K. Kemble did not explain this result. He

 did state that although his theoretical expression includes a vibrational frequency, it
 nevertheless treats only the rotational specific heat. He added that vibrational contri-

 butions to the specific heat should be seen at temperatures higher than 500 or 600 K.

 This ambitious attempt did not succeed, though it did provide a starting point for later
 work.121

 After finishing his Ph.D. in June 1917, Kemble became involved in war work.

 He returned to Harvard as a faculty member in 1920. His work on the specific heat
 of hydrogen was not published until 1923, when it appeared in substantially altered
 form in a joint paper with Van Vleck, Kemble's first Ph.D. student. Kemble and Van

 Vleck first noted that Kemble's 1917 APS abstract was "marred by an error," and that
 their purpose was "to present a corrected calculation of the rotational and vibrational

 specific heat of an elastic model of a diatomic gas molecule." Their treatment was
 correspondingly complex, and in contrast to Kemble's dissertation and to almost all

 other calculations of the specific heat of hydrogen, emphasized the behavior of the
 specific heat at high temperatures, up to about 2,000 K. 122

 Kemble and Van Vleck began by noting that one could not simply add a vibra-

 tional term to the specific heat, since it would not take into account the "expansion of

 the molecule by centrifugal force." Instead, they introduced an anharmonic restoring
 force and now using Sommerfeld's formalism, derived a complex and nonseparable
 equation for the energy of a vibrating rotator as a function of both the rotational and

 vibrational quantum numbers. This equation used two free parameters to fit the theoret-

 ical curve to the data, the rotational frequency at zero vibration,123 and the vibrational
 frequency at zero rotation. They calculated the specific heat with Reiche's Curve V

 weights but with their own complex energy expression, noting briefly that Reiche's
 weights worked best for the rigid rotator. (They also noted pointedly that Kemble
 had obtained Reiche's results in 1917!) From liquid-hydrogen temperatures to room
 temperature, their curve is nearly identical to Reiche's Curve V (or Kemble's Curve

 E). Unlike Reiche, and in contrast to Kemble's dissertation, they remarked briefly that
 the agreement with the observations is "quite satisfactory."

 In fact, their comparison to experimental results strongly emphasized the behavior

 of the specific heat at high temperatures, where vibrational degrees of freedom should

 appear, using primarily what they called "less trustworthy" high-temperature data up

 to about 2,000 K. These data had been collected by Mathias Pier, another of Nernsťs

 assistants, in 1909. 124 They commented at one point that at the highest temperatures

 they had carried out their partition series to 13 terms! The numerical computations
 must have been staggering, particularly given their complex energy expression, and
 shows the importance they attached to this high-temperature behavior. Van Vleck,

 many years later, recalled that around 1920 the Harvard physics department did not
 possess a mechanical calculator, so that he had been forced to borrow one at the
 business school.125

 Kemble and Van Vleck's results were widely cited, and Van Vleck used an elastic

 rotator again in a 1926 review.126 Other investigations of the specific heat of hydrogen

 were, however, almost exclusively confined to rigid rotators, and did not extend higher

 than room temperature.

 6 Vibration-rotation spectra in diatomic molecules

 Most of Kemble's thesis, and all of the experimental work it entailed, concerned the

 infrared absorption spectra of diatomic molecules and their implications for quantum

 theory. His experimental results, interpreted in the light of his theoretical perspective,
 reinforced the conclusion from his specific-heat calculations that diatomic molecules
 could not exist in rotation-free states. It is only one example of the ways in which
 these two seemingly disparate problems affected one another. A clearer picture of the

 history of molecular spectra and its relation to the specific heat of hydrogen is thus

 essential if we are to understand the central importance of these molecular themes for

 the early history of quantum theory.

 6.1 Niels Bjerrum, Eva von Bahr, and vibration-rotation spectra

 The theoretical and experimental study of infrared molecular spectra developed
 roughly in parallel with early quantum theory. Kemble was attracted to this prob-

 lem by the work of a group of scientists centered in Berlin, where the study of infrared
 spectra had long been a priority. Their experiments had been essential to Planck's
 analysis of black-body radiation in 1900.

 In 1912, Niels Bjerrum, a Danish chemist working in Nernsťs laboratory in Berlin,

 was the first to take up the connection between quantum theory and molecular spec-

 tra, in a paper published in a Festschrift for Nernst. Bjerrum began by recalling Paul
 Drude's conclusion that visible spectra result from electrons, but infrared spectra result

 from molecular motions that, Bjerrum suggested, include both vibration and rotation.
 He went on to develop Lord Rayleigh's (1892) argument that if a molecular dipole
 rotates about an axis perpendicular to its vibrational motion it will emit or absorb radi-

 ation not only at its vibrational frequency, call it uvib, but also about the frequencies

 Vvib =Ь Vrot. According to Bjerrum, the central frequency should be sharp, but the other

 two should appear as broad bands, with the rotational velocities distributed according
 to the Maxwell-Boltzmann law. He went on to suggest that rotational bands should

 appear at longer wavelengths, corresponding to purely rotational motion, and was able
 to point to some experimental evidence in support. For example, absorption bands in

 hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the far infrared might be attributable to rotation, and an

 absorption band around 3.5 д to combined vibration and rotation, though the expected
 three separate peaks - a sharp line at 3.5 д, and diffuse ones at 3.4 and 3.6 д had not

 been observed. He concluded that "the experimental evidence supporting the proposed

 theory is rather weak."127

 In the second part of his article, Bjerrum turned to quantum theory. He cited Nernsťs

 1911 paper, and observed (incorrectly) that Nernst had quantized both rotational and
 vibrational motion. Bjerrum went on to quantize the rotational energies and frequen-
 cies himself, using the same equations, Eq. (2), that Lorentz had given at the first

 Solvay conference. Bjerrum could easily have known that result, though he did not cite
 Lorentz. His conclusion followed at once: "If the rotational frequencies are assumed
 to vary discontinuously it follows that a band originating from a linear vibration of
 the rotating molecule must consist of a series of fine lines."128

 Bjerrum had supposed in 1912 that these fine lines directly represented the mechan-

 ical rotation and vibration frequencies of charged and hence radiating dipoles. Molec-
 ular spectroscopists continued this tradition until about 1920, even after Bohr had

 related atomic spectra to energy differences between stable electronic states in 1913.

 A year later, Eva von Bahr, a Swedish physicist working in Heinrich Rubens's

 laboratory in Berlin, provided spectacular confirmation of Bjerrum's predictions, as
 well as strong new evidence for quantum theory.129 She called attention to several

 experimental results, including complex fine structure in the absorption spectrum of

 water vapor. But her central - and most persuasive - result came from the absorption

 spectrum of HCl. She first pointed to Wilhelm Burmeister's spectra, taken with a fluo-

 rite prism, that showed the continuous double absorption peaks predicted by Bjerrum.

 (She seemed uncertain about whether a third central peak was to be expected theoret-

 ically, and noted that a narrow line, even if present, might be difficult to detect.) She

 then displayed her own results, taken with a quartz prism, that showed clear, evenly

 spaced peaks within the envelopes defined by Burmeister's "double bands." The appli-
 cation of Bjerrum's quantization condition, Eq. (2), led to a moment of inertia for HCl

 that agreed with a value derived from kinetic theory. It also agreed, as Bjerrum later

 showed, with a moment of inertia calculated from the separation of the double-band
 "envelope" using the equipartition law.130

 6.2 Edwin C. Kemble and vibration-rotation spectra

 Kemble's first two papers, published in 1916, about a year before he completed his
 doctorate, show a thorough understanding of this literature. He recalled in 1962 that

 in graduate school he had become interested in quantum theory, especially its impli-

 cations for infrared molecular spectra. An early calculation suggested to him that the

 potential energy of molecular oscillators should be anharmonic, and therefore, that
 harmonics should be emitted or absorbed along with the fundamental frequencies.

 His first two papers support his recollection. The first summarized Bjerrum's and von

 Bahr's work, and at the same time, corrected one of Bjerrum's calculations. The sec-

 ond outlined his theoretical argument for an anharmonic potential, and sought possible

 examples of harmonic bands in the existing literature.131

 The experimental part of Kemble's dissertation, done together with James
 Brinsmade, clinched the case.132 Brinsmade had developed an infrared spectrome-

 ter that, as Kemble put it in his dissertation, was "hastily adapted to the problem in
 hand at a time when neither Mr. Brinsmade nor the writer knew how far the experiment

 would be carried."133 They found double-band first harmonics for CO, HBr, and HCl,
 and for the last, some of the quantum fine structure. However, the harmonics were

 not at exactly twice the fundamental frequencies, a discrepancy they were inclined to

 attribute to an error in the refractive index of their quartz prism.

 Just as important, their measurements of the sharp absorption peaks in the funda-
 mental HCl band centered at about 3.5 ß showed higher resolution and considerably

 more detail than von Bahr's. Kemble argued that these peaks directly reflected quan-
 tized rotational states, and concluded (like Debye) that Planck's first theory must

 therefore be correct.134 Their graph (Fig. 5) shows closer spacing of the peaks as the

 frequency increased, and also displays a prominent gap at the center of the pattern, as
 if one line were missing (the dashed line shown in the accompanying line drawing).
 Kemble attributed the uneven spacing of the lines to an anharmonic elastic force:
 As the molecule rotated faster, it would stretch, and as a result the frequency at the new

 equilibrium position would decrease. According to Kemble's calculations, included
 in his dissertation but not published until 1920, the peaks should be given by

 v = [v>o - constant X m2v'] ± mv' (not Kemble's notation). (30)

 Here, v is the experimentally measured frequency; Ц) is the frequency of vibration at
 zero rotation; m is the rotational quantum number; the constant was derived from

 131 Kemble (1916a,b), Kemble, AHQP interview (footnote 1 17), esp. session 1(11 May 1962), pp. 6-7;
 and letter of Kemble to Kuhn, 14 May 1962, on page 14 of the same session. In the first paper, Kemble

 says that both Lorentz and Nernst had quantized the rotator. He also corrected one of Bjerrum's calcu-
 lations - Kemble's lengthy argument led him to Ehrenfest's quantization condition rather than Lorentz's.

 The term in brackets in Eq. (30) thus represented the shift in the frequency of vibration,

 and the last term the rotational frequency added to or subtracted from the vibrational

 frequency. They stated that the moment of inertia did not change, by which they
 seemed to mean that they could describe their data with a single value of v' and hence

 J ; apparently, the molecule stretched enough to cause an anharmonic decrease in the

 vibrational frequency, but not enough to change the moment of inertia significantly.136

 center. The lines would be evenly spaced, as shown in my accompanying line drawing, if it were not for
 the effects of an anharmonic potential energy and other corrections. The top labels in the drawing represent

 Bjerrum's picture in 1912 as well as Kemble's in 1917, in which the lines directly represented mechanical
 vibration and rotation frequencies. The bottom ones show transitions in absorption, as pictured by Reiche
 and Kratzer. See Assmus (1992b) for a careful and detailed discussion

 the anharmonic force law; and v' is "a certain basic frequency"135 identified in
 Kemble's dissertation with the quantized frequency of rotation corresponding to his

 and Ehrenfest's quantized energies,

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 155

 Indeed, with different theoretical interpretations, similar equations would continue to

 do good service in succeeding iterations of quantum theory.

 The gap was more easily explained. Kemble knew of Bohr's 1913 theory in 1917;
 nevertheless, like Bjerrum, he continued to assume that the absorption peaks in HCl

 represented the mechanical frequencies of vibration and rotation.137 In this picture,
 the gap corresponded to a missing m - 0 line, and implied that diatomic molecules
 could not exist in rotation-free states. This conclusion was reinforced by Kemble's

 analysis of the specific heat of hydrogen; there too, the molecules had to rotate. Both
 Kemble's dissertation and Brinsmade and Kemble's paper drew this connection in no

 uncertain terms. Two separate lines of experimental evidence, strongly conditioned by

 their theoretical contexts, led Kemble and many others after him to the same inexorable
 conclusion.138

 6.3 Elmer Imes and vibration-rotation spectra

 In 1919, Elmer Imes, one of the first African- Americans to earn a Ph.D. degree in

 physics, and a student of Harrison M. Randall at the University of Michigan, extended
 Brinsmade and Kemble's measurements on the hydrogen halides.139 During a sab-
 batical leave in 1909-1910, Randall had studied infrared spectroscopy with Friedrich

 Paschen at the University of Tübingen. On his return to Michigan, he energetically

 set out to establish a research laboratory in Ann Arbor. At first, under Paschen's influ-
 ence, he studied atomic spectra. But Randall tells us that he had been intrigued by
 Eva von Bahr's 1913 work on infrared molecular spectra and their connection to the

 new quantum theory. By 1918, he and his students were beginning to study molecular

 spectra themselves.140 Imes described a sophisticated apparatus that used a rock-salt

 prism to project part of a spectrum onto a grating spectroscope; in this way, he could

 be sure to separate wavelengths that were integral multiples of one another. He quoted
 a resolution of 29 Â, which he compared to 70 Â for Kemble and 100 À for von Bahr.

 Although his measurements of the fundamental band of HCl represented only a mod-
 est improvement over those of Brinsmade and Kemble, he was able to measure the
 individual lines of the first harmonic in more detail, and resolved for the first time

 those of HBr and HF. Even more important, he confirmed beyond the possibility of

 experimental error that the harmonics in HCl and HBr were not exact multiples of the

 fundamental frequencies.

 137 See Kemble (1918) (the abstract for his 1917 APS paper on the specific heat of hydrogen), which

 includes a passing reference to "the Bohr theory of atomic structure." After initial hesitation, Kemble con-
 cluded in his 1962 AHQP interview (footnote 1 17), esp. session 1(11 May 1962), p. 14, that he had not
 known of Bohr's theory this early. His memory apparently led him (and some historians!) astray. It remains

 unsurprising that he continued to follow Bjerrum's interpretation, as Assmus has argued in detail.

 138 See Janssen (2002) for a more general discussion of this theme.

 Were these bands harmonics at all? Imes clearly had his doubts. In their APS meeting

 abstract, Imes and Randall said bluntly that, "The 'harmonic' relationship is therefore

 not substantiated." Throughout much of Imes's paper, the word "harmonics" appears

 in prominent quotation marks, and there is even one reference to the "so-called har-

 monics." Imes used an empirical equation similar to Eq. (30) that was quadratic in the

 rotational quantum number to describe the uneven spacing of the fine-structure peaks.

 Not surprisingly, he made no reference to anharmonic forces, and regarded this effect

 as resulting only from a moment of inertia that increased as the molecule stretched at

 higher rotational frequencies. He made no mention of Bohr, and took it for granted

 that the spectral lines represented the mechanical vibration and rotation frequencies.

 The application of Bohr's frequency condition to molecular spectra, so that spec-

 tral lines represent transitions between nonradiating states, rather than the mechanical

 vibration and rotation frequencies themselves, took place in stages over several years.

 Kemble made a start in a 1920 paper in which he both summarized and extended the

 derivation of his anharmonic term, Eq. (30) from his dissertation: now the expression in

 brackets, suitably altered, represented the energy difference between vibrational states,

 divided of course by Planck's constant; the last term, however, remained unchanged,

 and still represented directly the mechanical rotational frequency of the molecule.141

 In this way, Kemble could show that the harmonics need not be exact multiples of

 the fundamental. Thus, although he did not cite Imes's paper, he by now agreed that

 the experimental discrepancy was real, and showed that his new formulation, combin-

 ing an anharmonic force with Bohr's frequency condition, could explain the harmonic
 discrepancy that both he and Imes had measured.

 Kemble was not alone in his assumption that his spectral lines represented mechan-

 ical frequencies. Karl Schwarzchild142 and perhaps even Niels Bohr had thought the
 rotational term in the infrared vibration-rotation spectra represented a mechanical
 frequency, even though both used term differences to calculate the frequencies of
 rotational lines elsewhere (Schwarzchild in the visible, Bohr in the far infrared). Even

 though Bohr calculated frequencies in the far infrared from energy-term differences,

 he seems to say that von Bahr's measurements of vibration-rotation spectra in the near

 infrared directly reflect mechanical rotation frequencies.143

 141 Kemble (1920). Kemble does not say explicitly that he is treating the two terms differently, but there is

 no other way to interpret his equations; see for example pp. 99, 101 . Adolph Kratzer noticed this difference

 later in 1920; see Sect. 6.5 below. However, about a year later in a Harvard colloquium, Kemble did describe

 transitions as arising from changes in rotational, vibrational, and electronic quantum numbers, possibly after
 seeing Kratzer (1920); see Kemble, notes for Harvard Colloquium, 2 May 1921, AHQP microfilm reel 55.

 142 Schwarzschild (1916, p. 568). Assmus (1991, pp. 93-94 and 1992a, p. 227) first called attention to this
 aspect of Schwarzschild 's paper.

 143 Bohr (1916, esp. pp. 261, 267-272 and 281). Bohr's discussion of von Bahr's rotation- vibration spectra
 made no references to term differences, but did make an analogy to the Zeeman effect, which, he argued,
 is an exception to his term-difference principle. Bohr did calculate frequencies from term differences a
 page later (pp. 271-272) and even used an intuitively derived selection rule, but made clear his discussion

 applies to purely rotational spectra in the far infrared, for which, as he said, no experimental evidence yet
 existed. Such spectra were first measured for HCl by Czerny (1925, 1927). Interestingly, Bohr notes that for
 a harmonic oscillator, frequencies calculated from term differences, En+' - En = hv, nevertheless reflect
 the mechanical frequency of the oscillator; see p. 267. See Darrigol (1992, pp. 90-93), Assmus (1991,
 pp. 103-105), Assmus (1992a, pp. 228-229).

 6.4 Fritz Reiche, vibration-rotation spectra, and the introduction of half-quanta

 In 1920, Fritz Reiche and Adolf Kratzer (of whom more later) calculated spectral
 frequencies from term differences for vibration-rotation spectra more consistently,

 building on the work of Torsten Heurlinger and Wilhelm Lenz about a year earlier.144

 What came to be called a selection rule, derived from Bohr's correspondence principle,

 states that the rotational quantum number changes by A m = ±1.145 Using this result

 together with Eq. (16), 146 it is easy to show that (apart from anharmonic effects) the

 spectroscopic frequencies are given by

 y = Vvib ± mJr'

 Here i>vib is the vibrational frequency calculated from the energy difference between
 vibrational states. The second term represents transitions among rotational states.

 Thus, in the absorption spectrum of HCl, a molecule goes from the ground state to the
 first excited vibrational state, and at the same time either absorbs or emits rotational

 quanta.

 At this point, a difficulty emerges: this equation predicts a set of evenly spaced
 lines (including the dashed line in Fig. 5). By contrast, the data from Kemble and
 Brinsmade and from Imes clearly show a prominent gap in the center of the pattern,
 and von Bahr's data at least suggest a gap. Bjerrum's (and Kemble's) original scheme
 readily explains this gap if rotation-free states are forbidden. This new scheme did
 not: If one excludes m = 0, then two lines are missing, corresponding to rotational
 transitions 1 - >• 0 and 0 -> 1, and the gap is far too wide. Both Reiche and Kratzer

 needed a way out.

 Reiche submitted his paper for publication in December, 1919, and initially he had

 only von Bahr's data with which to work.147 He first summarized Bjerrum's theory,
 and then applied "Bohr's frequency condition" to both the rigid and the symmetric

 (or gyroscopic) rotator - he was unable to decide between the two, given, as he said,

 the imprecision of von Bahr's data. Reiche derived Eq. (32) for the symmetric rotator,

 using the solution he had found in his specific heat paper. He eliminated the two lines

 corresponding to m = 0 in Eq. (32) (that is, to the transitions 0 - > 1 and 1 -» 0), citing

 his analysis of the specific heat of hydrogen that implied the absence of rotation-free
 states.

 While Reiche's article was in page proof, however, he had come across Imes's

 article in The Astrophysical Journal. Imes's graph of the fundamental band of HCl,

 144 Heurlinger's work was particularly influential; the American spectroscopist Raymond Birge, for exam-
 ple, in a 1923 letter to Kemble, described Heurlinger's dissertation as "the most important paper on band
 spectra ever written" (Birge to Kemble, 4 June 1923, AHQP microfilm reel 50). See Brand (1995, pp. 181-
 185) and Fujisaki (1983b, pp. 69-73) for discussion and bibliography.

 145 Adalbert Rubinowicz, a student of Sommerfeld, gave an alternative derivation; see for example Darrigol
 (1992, Chapter 6).

 146 The rotational quantum number n in Eq. (16) is the same one as m here.

 much like Kemble's (Fig. 5) but unlike von Bahr's,148 showed a central gap clearly

 and unambiguously. The result was a strongly written postscript, in which Reiche said

 that Eq. (32) could not possibly be correct: without the two omitted m - 0 lines, the
 central gap was far too wide; and with them, there was no gap. Reiche added that he

 had discussed this problem frequently with Einstein, who had pointed to a possibility

 for removing the contradiction.149 If one replaced Eq. (16) with

 E" = (m + 0 ¿7 <33)

 then Eq. (32) became

 V - yvib ± Em+lh Em = fvib ± (m + 1) m =0,1,2,... (34)

 in agreement, as Reiche said, with Imes's observations - this equation gives a gap of
 appropriate size, with evenly spaced lines on either side. Einstein's suggestion, as far
 as I know, represents the first introduction of "half-quanta" into quantum theory -
 "a very remarkable business," as Einstein called it in a letter to Paul Ehrenfest later

 that year. In a letter to Fritz Haber, Einstein also noted that both the specific heat of

 hydrogen and the HCl spectrum imply a zero-point energy of rotation.150

 Arnold Eucken treated the same theme in a long review article on the application of

 quantum theory to molecular rotation submitted for publication in January 1920. 151

 He too inferred the absence of rotation-free states from both the specific heat of hydro-

 gen and molecular spectra. He independently derived the Bohr frequency condition,
 Eq. (32), though in a note he said that he had since discovered the same result in a
 publication by Lenz. Like Reiche, he had come across Imes's results for HCl while his

 article was in proof. In a puzzled-sounding footnote, in the midst of a section arguing
 for Bohr's frequency condition, he said with apparent surprise that Imes's data were

 better described by Bjerrum's picture. Unlike Reiche, he offered no resolution, though
 he would shortly do so.

 to have first met in 1914; see the letter of Einstein to Reiche, 18 July 1914 in Einstein (1987-2009, Vol. 8,

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 159

 6.5 Adolf Kratzer and vibration-rotation spectra

 In October 1920, Adolf Kratzer, a student of and, from 1918, an assistant to

 Sommerfeld, published a far more detailed and influential paper on the rotation- vibra-

 tion bands of HCl.152 Kratzer began by pointing out a difficulty in an earlier work by

 Torsten Heurlinger: although Heurlinger's use of a harmonic potential energy correctly

 led to a frequency shift proportional to the square of the rotational quantum number

 (see Eq. 30), it gave the wrong sign when compared with von Bahr's and Imes's experi-

 ments. Kratzer proposed to show that an anharmonic oscillator would show the correct

 behavior. Following Heurlinger, Kratzer used Bohr's frequency condition throughout,

 remarking in a note that Kemble's 1920 paper had done so only "in part."153

 Kratzer's thoroughgoing treatment introduced results and a notation that are still

 seen in modern textbooks. He derived an anharmonic correction term for zero rotation

 that, like Kemble's, accounted for the harmonics not being integral multiples of the
 fundamental. Sommerfeld, in language similar to (if often a good bit clearer than)
 many modern textbooks, described Kratzer's version of Eq. (30) as an interaction
 between vibration and rotation, in which the stretching of the molecule leads to both

 a larger moment of inertia and a smaller vibrational frequency.154

 Kratzer also had to explain the absence of a gap in Eq. (32). His solution was dra-
 matically different from Reiche's, whose 1920 paper he did not cite. He noted that
 Reiche's theory of specific heats might seem to imply that any transition involving
 the rotation-free state (m = 0) could not appear; thus, both the 0 - ► 1 and 1 -> 0
 lines should be missing, as Reiche had assumed. But the width of the gap in Imes's

 data, Kratzer pointed out, implied that only one of these lines is missing. He therefore
 assumed that the m = 0 state is not absent, but only unstable. Thus, a transition in
 which the molecule absorbs one rotational quantum as it goes from the m = 0 to the
 m = 1 rotational state is forbidden. But the one in which the molecule falls from

 m = 1 to m = 0 does appear! As Kratzer put it:

 In order to understand this fact, we may assume that the rotation-free state is by

 no means impossible. The theory of specific heats and the absence of the zero

 line reveal merely that the probability for the existence of the rotation-free state

 is vanishingly small

 external influences, but then exists only for a very short time....155

 This suggestion may seem improbable; and after the reappearance of half-quantum
 numbers in molecular spectra, it was roundly criticized. Walter Colby, for example,

 152 Kratzer (1920). Comparatively little has been written about Kratzer. See Cassidy (2007), and Mehra
 and Rechenberg (1982-2000, Vol. 6, index), for references to minimal biographical information. See also
 the Wikipedia article, "Adolf Kratzer," which seems to be drawn in considerable part from Mehra and
 Rechenberg.

 154 Sommerfeld (1922, Chapter VII, Sect. 2). My discussion is brief and incomplete. For more thorough
 accounts, see Brand (1995, esp. Chapter 9), Fujisaki (1983b, pp. 76-79), and Herzberg (1973). See also
 Ruark and Urey (1930, esp. pp. 376-380), where the treatment is almost identical to Kratzer's; and Herzberg
 (1950, pp. 106-1 14), where it is nearly so.

 observed several years later that although the 0 - > 1 transition was absent, the "reverse

 transition, 1 to 0 absorption, is present - a fact very difficult to reconcile with the pos-

 sibility of thermal equilibrium. This was an annoying difficulty for some time...."156

 Meanwhile, however, Kratzer's suggestion was widely adopted. Eucken, who had
 been so puzzled by Imes's data early in 1920, adopted Kratzer's picture later that
 year, albeit at second hand.157 Reiche himself adopted it in his 1921 textbook, as did
 Sommerfeld, who in the third edition of his Atombau remarked that the "deduction

 is surprising at first sight, and excellently confirmed by the behavior of the specific
 heat of rotation ... of hydrogen."158 Reiche's and Einstein's suggestion had vanished
 almost without a trace.159

 Nevertheless, half-quanta could not be denied. Kratzer himself introduced them in

 March, 1922 to explain the fine structure of the "cyan bands" - electronic transitions

 in the visible and ultraviolet region of the spectrum.160 He attributed the half-quanta

 to an electronic orbital angular momentum directed perpendicular to the line joining

 the two nuclei (and thus parallel to the angular momentum of nuclear rotation about
 the center of mass). In a review article published later in 1922, Kratzer applied his
 new half-quanta only to the cyan bands, treating the infrared HCl spectra exactly as
 he had done in 1920. 161 But in December 1922, in a long article devoted primarily

 to combined electronic, vibrational, and rotational transitions, he noted briefly that he
 had changed his mind, and now believed that a priori , both the 0 -> 1 and the 1 -> 0

 transitions should be missing in the HCl fine structure, much as Reiche had concluded

 in 1920. Half-quanta, Kratzer said, entirely removed this difficulty, and even cleared
 up an inconsistency in his calculation of a numerical parameter in 1920.162

 Conversations between Kratzer and Werner Heisenberg almost certainly played

 a part in this story. The two had met in Sommerfeld's Munich institute in 1921, at

 about the time that Heisenberg had begun to employ half-quanta himself in his "core

 model."163 Heisenberg later recalled that he and Kratzer had talked about half-quanta

 156 Colby (1926, p. 55). See footnote 167 below for a similar criticism by Hendrik Kramers and Wolfgang
 Pauli.

 157 Eucken (1920b, p. 380). Eucken did not cite Kratzer (1920), which had probably not yet appeared.
 Instead, he said this solution had been kindly called to his notice by Wilhelm Lenz, who had worked with
 Kratzer when both were studying under Sommerfeld. Eucken cited Reiche (1920), but only in support of
 Eq. (32); he apparently overlooked the postscript at the end, in which Reiche presented his and Einstein's
 half-integral proposal.

 158 Sommerfeld (1922, Chapter 7, Sect. 2).

 159 I have come across only two passing references to Reiche's and Einstein's proposal during the years
 1920-1926 when half-quanta were in vogue; see Sommerfeld (1924, footnote on p. 713), and Barker (1923)
 (from Randall's Michigan group). Brand (1995, p. 176) gives the only reference I have seen in the historical

 literature; and (in what may be a typographical error) he gets the date wrong.

 160 Kratzer (1922a). The "cyan bands" are a widely studied system of bands in the violet, associated with

 the radical CN (cyanogen); in the 1920s and earlier, they were sometimes associated with molecular nitrogen
 instead; see for example Sommerfeld (1922, Chapter 7, Sect. 3; 1924, Chapter 9, Sect. 3).

 161 Kratzer (1922b).

 162 Kratzer (1923a, p. 85). This paper was an "extension" of Kratzer's Munich Habilitation thesis.

 163 For Heisenberg and half-quanta, see Cassidy (1992, esp. Chapters 7-8), and Cassidy (1979).
 Heisenberg's first paper was dated December 1921, only a few months before Kratzer's first use of half-
 quanta in March 1922, but well after Reiche (1920).

 Fig. 6 Model of Kramers and Pauli ( 1 923), taken from Kemble et al. ( 1 926, p. 3 1 2). Here m is the rotational

 angular momentum associated with rotation of nuclei about the center of mass, perpendicular to the line
 joining the nuclei. The electronic orbital angular momentum s is rigidly oriented at a fixed angle to the
 line joining the two nuclei. Note the components e and cr, respectively, parallel and perpendicular to the
 direction of m. Finally, j is the total angular momentum, quantized in integral units. To allow half-integral
 values of the rotational quantum number m in the hydrogen halides, Kramers and Pauli set a =0 and
 s = 1 /2. For this case, j, m, and s are mutually parallel and in the direction of m in the Fig.

 at length.164 It must have been encouraging for these young physicists to see this
 strange and controversial notion emerging from such drastically different contexts.

 6.6 Kramers, Pauli, and vibration-rotation spectra

 At about the same time, early in 1923, Hendrik Kramers and Wolfgang Pauli elabo-
 rated on Kratzer's introduction of an electronic angular momentum. In their model,

 the orbital electronic angular momentum was rigidly attached to the molecule at an

 arbitrary angle to the line joining the nuclei, and thus had components perpendicular

 and parallel to this line (Fig. 6). Max Born described it as a "top with an enclosed fly-
 wheel." 165 Both the total angular momentum and the electronic angular momentum

 were quantized, the latter sometimes in half-quanta; as a result, the nuclear angu-
 lar momentum was not quantized, but instead determined by geometry - the vector
 nuclear and electronic angular momenta had to add up to the integrally quantized total
 angular momentum. Molecular spectroscopists used this scheme for the next sev-
 eral years for spectra whose description required three rotational degrees of freedom.
 It served much the same function as the spin-orbit coupling schemes that Friedrich
 Hund would introduce in 1926, and that remain a staple of molecular spectroscopy
 textbooks.166

 Kramers and Pauli devoted a long section in their joint paper to the infrared spectrum

 of HCl, and after rejecting two other possible approaches, independently adopted the

 same one that Kratzer had proposed: a half-integral angular momentum directed at
 right angles to the line joining the nuclei. Kramers and Pauli also pointed out the
 physical implication: "no rotation-free stationary state of the molecule exists." 167

 Later in 1923, Walter Colby at the University of Michigan further strengthened the

 case for half-quanta. Since 1921, Colby and his associates had been improving Imes's
 measurements of the spectrum of HCl. In 1922, using a longer absorption chamber
 and an improved grating, they saw a "new group of faint /mes... [that] appear only
 when the gas is heated (500° C), and . . . may correspond to a change of radial [that

 is, vibrational] quantum from 1 to 2 although the frequencies do not agree with those

 predicted by Kratzer."168 A few months later, Colby, citing both Kratzer (1923a) and

 Kramers and Pauli, reported that he had recalculated the predicted frequencies using
 half-quanta and obtained good agreement.169

 Sommerfeld took note of these developments and adopted the new picture in the

 fourth (1924) edition of his Atombau. And in 1925, Marianus Czerny, another of the
 Berlin spectroscopists who had studied with Heinrich Rubens, clinched the case when

 in a difficult and innovative experiment he measured for the first time the pure rota-

 tional spectrum of HCl in the far infrared, and found a set of nearly evenly spaced
 rotational peaks that required half-quanta for their description.170 Thus by the mid-

 19208, the "old quantum theory," supplemented by the mysterious and controversial

 but increasingly necessary half-quanta, had given a fully adequate description of the
 rotational and rotation- vibration spectra of HCl.171 In particular, Bohr's frequency
 condition, an anharmonic potential, and the interaction between vibration and rotation

 accounted for the nonintegral harmonics and the spacings of the peaks. Half-quanta
 accounted for the gap in the center of the spectrum, for the transition between the

 /1 = 1 and n = 2 vibrational states, and even for the pure rotational spectrum in the
 far infrared. It was a remarkable achievement.172

 167 Kramers and Pauli (1923, p. 360). Kramers and Pauli knew that Kratzer had introduced half-quanta
 in electronic band spectra, but did not know that he had also adopted them for the infrared spectrum of
 HCl. They criticized his first attempt (Kratzer 1920) to explain the missing line, or gap, in the spectrum,
 commenting that it is "rather unsatisfactory," before outlining their own explanation. Kratzer (1923a) had

 arrived at the Annalen der Physik in December 1922. Kramers and Pauli (1923) had arrived at the Zeitschrift
 für Physik only a month later; it is not surprising that they did not know of Kratzer's change of heart.

 mechanical frequencies. In her otherwise admirable and path-breaking analysis, Assmus (1992b, pp. 10-

 7 Half-quanta and the specific heat of hydrogen

 Almost immediately, theorists applied half-quanta to the specific heat of hydrogen:
 if half-quanta succeeded in describing one rotating dumbbell, might they not also
 work for the other? Alas, they did not. The American physical chemist Richard Chace

 Tolman made the first attempt.173 He noted that "half quantum numbers have recently
 shown a surprising tendency to appear," and cited a 1922 article by Kratzer in sup-
 port. Tolman showed - the fourth time the idea had appeared independently - how
 half-quanta could account for the gap in the center of the hydrogen halide spectra.174

 With this encouragement, he went on to apply them to the specific heat of hydrogen.
 He counted degenerate states much as Reiche had done, and showed that the parti-

 tion function was given by Q = 2ne~(n~2) where n is an integer, and where
 the rotator energies are given in the exponent. He calculated the specific heat in the

 usual way. His curve runs too high at 200 K, and much too low at room temperatures.
 Nevertheless, Tolman was encouraged. With considerable satisfaction, he pointed out
 that:

 [It] should be noted how simply we have arrived at the conclusion that the a

 priori probabilities of the successive energy levels stand in the ratio 1, 2, 3, etc.,

 without resorting to any artificial rejection of the states of no rotation....175

 He also suggested, citing Kemble and Van Vleck's 1923 article, that vibrational con-
 tributions might raise the specific-heat curve at high temperatures, though he made

 no attempt to explore this possibility. He was particularly encouraged by his value for
 the moment of inertia, which was smaller than Reiche's and closer to a result from

 hydrogen band spectra cited by Sommerfeld.

 Erwin Schrödinger had long cast a skeptical eye on the specific heat of hydro-
 gen. In a 1917 review article in Die Naturwissenschaften, he had contented himself
 with a graph that showed only a smooth line running through the data points. He all

 but ignored the theories, observing only that the approaches of Nernst, Einstein and
 Stern, Ehrenfest, and Planck "all lead to a more or less good explanation" of the data.

 He discussed none of these theories, observing only that, "We will not go into these

 and 28). 1 think my analysis here shows just how central Bohr's frequency condition and the introduction
 of half-quanta were. In 1926, for example, Van Vleck (1926a, p. 230) stated emphatically that, although
 half-quantum numbers are "in many respects decidedly illogical," their use is "made plausible by the suc-
 cessful use of half-integers in interpreting frequencies in infra-red absorption bands." Kemble himself had
 immediately qualified his statement, and had said even more forcefully in a letter to Raymond Birge a
 year earlier that Bjerrum's theory was "early and erroneous" (Kemble to Birge, 25 February 1925, AHQP
 microfilm reel 50).

 173 Tolman (1923). See also the summary in Tolman (1927, Chapter 9). In 1927, Tolman worked primarily

 with the old quantum theory, though after summarizing his 1923 paper, he observed that "The final accept-
 able treatment of the quantum states of the dipole rotator and their a-priori probabilities will perhaps have
 to be based on the new dynamics" (p. 108).

 174 Tolman (1923) cited only Kratzer (1922b), in which Kratzer (as already noted) introduced half-quanta
 for visible bands (electronic transitions), but retained his 1920 explanation for the gap in the HCl spectrum.

 Moreover, Tolman's analysis leading to half-quanta was notably different from either Kratzer's or Reiche's.

 circumstances more closely, since they are still by no means resolved." He did point
 out, much as Nernst had done in 1911, that quantum theory had cleared up earlier
 problems with the specific heats of gases.176

 Schrödinger was no less skeptical in 1924, when in an article in the Zeitschrift für

 Physik , and at more length in a review of specific heats in the Handbuch der Phys-

 ik , he himself turned to the specific heat of hydrogen.177 Like Tolman, he adopted
 half-integral quantum numbers, noting that the "approach first introduced into band
 spectra by Kratzer not only made the absence of rotation-free states understand-
 able without special assumptions," but also explained the gap in the middle of the

 band. However, instead of finding the weights in the partition function by counting
 degenerate states or by calculating the size of phase-space cells, he simply noted
 that, "The claims of theory are on this point ... so uncertain, that one might do
 better to fit the weight ratios as well as possible to the observations."178 In this

 spirit, he wrote the partition function as ^gQ~s^kT , and gave two possible sets of
 weights,

 g' -82 • g3 = 1 : 2 : 4 (curve A) and g' : g2 : g3 = 4 : 7 : 17 (curve B) ,

 chosen to match the data as closely as possible without exceeding the equiparti-
 tion value at high temperatures. The results were reasonably good, and Curve В
 in particular was an improvement over Reiche's Curve V. Nevertheless, both over-

 shot the "fatal point" (as Schrödinger called it) at 200 K, and came in slightly low
 at room temperature. There, at least, he could call attention to new room tempera-
 ture measurements, "to which Herr Eucken kindly directed me," that promised better
 agreement.

 Like Tolman, Schrödinger appealed to the band spectra of hydrogen to justify half-

 quanta. He first noted that, "Without doubt, better agreement with the simple dumbbell

 model [whole quanta] would be achieved if one liberalized the choice of weights".179

 As he pointed out, however, the moments of inertia from his theory agreed more closely
 with those drawn from hydrogen band spectra as well as from measurements of the

 "entropy constant" - the constant in what is today usually called the Sackur-Tetrode
 equation for the entropy of an ideal gas.

 Thus, over a decade after Einstein and Stern had first taken up the problem, physi-

 cists had still not found a quantitatively accurate theory for the specific heat of hydro-
 gen. Even the introduction of the half-quanta, which had worked so well for molecular

 spectra, had not led to a more accurate theory, though they at least made the prohibition

 of rotation-free states seem less arbitrary. Schrödinger's resort to arbitrary weights, in

 an attempt, however empirical, to find a better fit to the experimental data, shows just

 how seriously he and his contemporaries took the failure to find a satisfactory theory
 for the specific heat of hydrogen.

 8 New data and a new quantum mechanics

 The year 1924 brought the first of several new measurements of the specific heat of

 hydrogen,180 the first to appear since those of Scheel and Heuse in 191 3. These exper-

 iments often employed new and innovative experimental techniques, and by 1925 led
 to occasional bickering among some experimentalists, eager to explain small discrep-
 ancies by criticizing their competitors' techniques and data reduction.

 In band spectra, 1924 also saw the discovery of a surprising new effect: rotational

 lines of alternating intensity in the electronic band spectra of diatomic molecules with

 identical nuclei. This phenomenon, first seen by the German spectroscopist Reinhard

 Mecke in singly ionized nitrogen,181 was followed by the discovery that in molecular

 helium and oxygen, every other rotational line was absent. One attempted explanation
 by Gerhard Dieke, at the time a student of Ehrenfest in Leiden, involved quarter-

 quanta, a suggestion that was roundly denounced by such figures as Heisenberg and
 Van Vleck.182 Dieke also attempted a treatment of the specific heat of hydrogen using
 quarter-quanta, with only limited success.183 However, the connection Dieke saw
 between the specific heat of hydrogen and the lines of alternating intensity figures

 prominently in the final stages of our story.

 The following years also saw the birth of modern quantum mechanics. Heisenberg's
 1925 "reinterpretation" paper led to the matrix mechanics of Born, Heisenberg, and
 Jordan. Schrödinger's papers on wave mechanics followed in 1926. Just as in the

 old quantum theory, the rotator was a central problem, straightforward to solve and
 essential to molecular physics. Heisenberg and Schrödinger both gave solutions for
 the rigid rotator.184 Others, including Reiche, David Dennison, and Isidor I. Rabi and
 Ralph de Laer Kronig, employed both matrix and wave mechanics to give more gen-
 eral solutions that included the symmetric as well as the rigid rotator. These results
 led to new theories of molecular spectra that were nearly identical to the generally

 successful efforts of the old quantum theory.185

 One prominent result was the justification of the mysterious half-quanta. As both

 Heisenberg and Schrödinger pointed out, the energy of a rigid rotator using half-quanta

 Cornish and Eastman (1928); see Figs. 8 and 1 1. Giacomini's data had been taken in Nernst's Berlin lab-
 oratory in 1922, but were not published until 1925. His data and Brinkworth's covered the region around
 200 К and showed a slightly higher specific heat than Eucken (1912) and Scheel and Heuse (1913) had
 measured. Cornish and Eastman's more comprehensive measurements in 1928 confirmed this result.

 183 Dieke (1925). See also the letter of Dieke to Van Vleck, 9 October 1925, AHQP microfilm reel 49, in
 which Dieke stated that Einstein had encouraged his efforts. He also said that he was not satisfied with his

 results, but that Ehrenfest had encouraged him to publish. Perhaps for that reason, his paper appeared in

 Physica, at that time ajournai published in Dutch.

 £ = {("' + 0 "Í}¿7 = ",<", + 1)¿7- <35>

 The term on the right-hand side is of course the modern value.

 John H. Van Vleck was among the first to apply the new quantum mechanics to

 the specific heat of hydrogen. In August 1926, he and his first Ph.D. student at the

 University of Minnesota, Elmer Hutchisson, published an impressive two-part review

 article in The Physical Review. This work had begun in 1924 as an attempt to extend
 Tolman's half-quanta model to high temperatures, but was quickly adapted to the new
 theory.186 Van Vleck gave an extensive theoretical discussion, while Hutchisson com-

 pared the various specific-heat theories with experiment. Van Vleck began by noting
 that "the quantum theory has been revolutionized by the new mechanics...." Much

 as Reiche had done in 1919, he systematically and thoroughly worked through the
 various possibilities - among them Reiche's "whole quanta," even though "it is very
 doubtful that they are allowable in the new quantum mechanics"; the "half quanta" of

 the new mechanics (he consistently preferred the language of the old quantum theory);
 different weights; and both rigid and elastic rotators.187

 As in 1923, Van Vleck was interested in the behavior of the specific heat far above

 room temperatures, at which vibrational degrees of freedom are excited. His most

 successful model used the elastic rotator that he and Kemble had developed in 1923.

 As he showed, their complex expression for energy was unchanged in the new quan-
 tum mechanics apart from the use of half-quanta. The weights were those of the new

 quantum mechanics; and like everyone since Ehrenfest, they used the energies and
 weights to calculate the partition function and the specific heat. The result was dis-
 couraging: "Unfortunately, an impossible specific heat curve is obtained ... from the

 simple theory of the rotator in the new mechanics...."188 That curve, he explained,

 was similar to Planck's, reaching a high, broad peak before eventually dropping to the
 equipartition value. With considerable insight, he said that:

 The failure of the simple theory is doubtless due to the non-polar character of

 the hydrogen molecule and is probably intimately connected with the alternating
 intensities found in the band spectra of certain non-polar molecules.189

 Significantly, Van Vleck fastened on the "non-polar character" of the hydrogen mole-

 cule, rather than its two identical nuclei. But he did not see how to apply this insight,
 even though, as he reported, Bohr, Kramers, Born, and Heisenberg had all suggested
 to him (correctly, it turned out) that:

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 167

 [It] appears likely that the alternating intensities are in some way connected with

 the extension of the Pauli exclusion principle which has recently been developed

 by Heisenberg in applying the new quantum mechanics to the spectrum of neutral
 helium....190

 Van Vleck was no novice in quantum theory, as both his insightful textbook and
 his own research clearly show. Other publications show how quickly he had absorbed

 the new theory.191 This episode serves to remind us of the strange and unexpected
 behavior of indistinguishable particles in quantum mechanics, and shows how diffi-
 cult it was even for someone as exceptional as Van Vleck to see the implications of
 these new ideas.

 Van Vleck was therefore reduced to the same sort of arbitrary artifices that Reiche

 had employed:

 We shall list below several specific ways of crawling out of the specific heat
 dilemma by assuming more or less empirically a different quantization than in

 the simple polar rotator. Most of the suggestions appear rather artificial and are

 frankly only conjectures.192

 Van Vleck's most successful attempt, like Reiche's, arbitrarily excluded the first term

 in his partition function, corresponding to the lowest rotational energy state. He
 pronounced the resulting curve "in quite satisfactory agreement with the observed
 data."193

 Hutchisson, whose paper compared the various theories with the data, was more

 restrained. Even with new data that showed somewhat higher specific heats around

 200 K, Hutchisson pointed out "a real discrepancy between experiment and theory
 in the slope of the specific heat curves between 120° and 220° K." He added that
 "it is necessary to consider not only the rotational energy . . . but also the vibrational

 energy and the increase of energy which is caused by the expansion of the molecules

 due to centrifugal forces."194 This step involved treating the (unknown) vibrational

 frequency in the ground state as a free parameter. Without it, Van Vleck's curve would
 have come in too low at room temperature. Van Vleck seems to have been of two
 minds about this curve; on the one hand, he said, along the lines of the passage quoted

 above, that: "It is hard to imagine any theoretical basis for the complete exclusion of

 the [lowest energy] state...."195 On the other hand,

 one must at the same time realize that observed specific heats furnish fairly def-

 inite evidence as to what a priori probabilities [weights] and ranges of quantum

 numbers are legitimate. For this reason, it does not appear altogether unlikely

 that the true specific heat curve is of the form . . . given below.196

 In short, Van Vleck had found a curve that, if not perfect, gave reasonable agreement

 with the data. The fit was noticeably better than Reiche's curve V - but like Reiche's,

 it came at the cost of an arbitrary and entirely mysterious assumption.197

 Van Vleck did not stop there. He went on to consider, and reject, models based

 on the symmetric (or gyroscopic) rotator, on the grounds that an electronic angular
 momentum would result in a paramagnetic molecule.198 Experimentally, however,
 hydrogen was diamagnetic. He refuted a suggestion made to him by Hendrik Kramers

 that Bose-Einstein statistics might somehow come into play. He devoted a long section

 to band spectra, and considered at length, in the context of both the specific heat and

 the band lines of alternating intensity, a theory of Ehrenfest and Tolman that argued for

 the exclusion of every other state in nonpolar molecules, and a related proposal by his
 friend John C. Slater.199 He considered and rejected Dieke's "unreasonable 'quarter
 quanta'."

 Van Vleck concluded with a section on the chemical (or entropy) constant. He
 pointed out that, in principle, this constant should shed light on both a priori proba-

 bilities and moments of inertia. Alas, the remainder of his discussion pointed out the

 inadequacies in both theory and experiment. He glumly concluded that "the correlation

 of experimental and theoretical chemical constants is at present in a decidedly chaotic

 state."200 Van Vleck later expressed considerable dissatisfaction with this paper.201 It

 was nevertheless a thorough and insightful survey of the state of theory and experiment
 towards the end of 1926. Even the advent of the new quantum mechanics did not at

 first point the way towards a solution of this long-standing dilemma.

 Despite these unpromising beginnings, a successful description of the specific heat

 of hydrogen emerged in the new quantum mechanics less than a year later. It is con-
 venient to identify four stages:

 • In June 1926, Werner Heisenberg discovered the unexpected behavior of identical

 particles in quantum mechanics and used this discovery to analyze the spectrum
 of helium (Sect. 9).

 196 Van Vleck (1926b, p. 986).

 197 Hutchisson's curve fell much closer to the new data at 200 К than did Reiche's Curve V. It is, however,

 difficult to determine exactly how Hutchisson did the calculations, which must have been horrendously
 complex. I cannot reproduce his results exactly from the equations and parameter values that he listed.
 His Ph.D. thesis consists of reprints of two publications, including this one, and so provides no additional
 insight into his calculations. It later turned out that vibrational degrees of freedom are not excited until well

 above room temperature and that the effect of centrifugal expansion on the specific heat is negligible.

 198 A promising gyroscopic model based on the old quantum theory, cited by both Van Vleck (1926b)
 and Hutchission (1926), had been developed by Hans Lessheim (1926), a student of Reiche's at Bres-

 lau. Both Lessheim and Reiche (1926, p. 455) rejected this model on a quite different basis: it implied
 a moment of inertia, 3 x 10-41 gmcm , that they thought was larger than was allowed from molecular
 spectra measurements (see Table 1). Ironically, this value turned out to be considerably too small.

 • In December 1926 and February 1927, Heisenberg and Friedrich Hund applied
 these ideas to molecular spectra, and Hund tried to extend them to the specific heat

 of hydrogen (Sects. 9, 10).

 • In 1926 and 1927, a breakthrough in experimental spectroscopy led to the first

 accurate spectroscopic measurement of the moment inertia of molecular hydrogen
 (Sect. 11).

 • In May 1 927, the American theorist David Dennison took advantage of all of these

 developments to construct the modern quantum-mechanical theory of the specific

 heat of hydrogen (Sect. 12).

 9 Werner Heisenberg, indistinguishable particles, and the spectrum of helium

 The spectrum of helium presented another unsolved problem in the old quantum
 theory.202 Energy levels, particularly that of the ground state, had proven impossi-
 ble to calculate accurately. Moreover, the spectrum of helium (similar to that of the
 alkaline earths) was divided into two noncombining term series, named parahelium
 and orthohelium. The first consisted of singlets; the second were thought to consist
 of doublets until 1926, when their triplet structure was predicted by Heisenberg and

 confirmed by experiment.203

 Matrix mechanics did not originally encompass many-body problems. Thus it was

 a considerable triumph for the new theory when Heisenberg, in a series of three papers

 in late 1926 and early 1927, uncovered the surprising behavior of identical particles in
 the new quantum mechanics, explained the noncombining para and ortho term series
 in helium, and made a start at the calculation of energy levels.204 Heisenberg recalled,

 years later, that "this paper was also full of excitement for me because so many new

 things came up."205

 Heisenberg began his first paper by criticizing Schrödinger's conceptual picture of
 wave mechanics, even as he was showing how useful its formalism could be - and

 indeed, he would find Schrödinger's wave mechanics essential. Then, in what resem-

 bled an undergraduate classical-mechanics lecture, he reviewed the familiar textbook
 problem of two coupled harmonic oscillators,206 arguing that it was the "simplest
 conceivable many-body problem" and at the same time "possesses all characteristic

 properties of the quantum-mechanical . . . problem." He wrote the standard Hamilto-
 nian for two coupled harmonic oscillators,

 identical particles at about the same time, and better understood the connection to gas statistics, but did not
 treat helium. Fermi (1926) likewise worked in the context of ideal gas theory. See Jammer (1966-1989,

 for which, of course, the two masses oscillate either in phase or 180° out of phase,
 with different frequencies.

 Heisenberg used Eq. (37) to write Eq. (36) in terms of the normal modes, and

 quantized the resulting Hamiltonian to obtain

 ( / 1' / / 1'

 thus describing two independent normal-mode oscillators with quantum numbers n '
 and n!v He then supposed the masses to be charged, and investigated both dipole and

 higher-order transitions between quantum states labeled by (n',,^), using an argu-
 ment apparently drawn from the correspondence principle and not depending on the
 new quantum mechanics.

 Figure 7 shows the remarkable result: the states separate into what Heisenberg
 called + and • states. Like states could combine with one another, but combinations

 between + and • states were absolutely forbidden. He noted a "characteristic uncer-

 tainty": are both term systems present in nature, or only one? Heisenberg argued that

 this "characteristic resonance" (as he called it) between coupled systems could apply
 not only to harmonic oscillators in classical physics, but also to more general sys-
 tems in quantum mechanics: "I would like to show that coupled systems in quantum
 mechanics always behave similarly to the above-explained example."207

 Heisenberg began with two identical unperturbed systems coupled by an interaction
 Hamiltonian that he treated as a perturbation. Since the two systems have identical
 energy levels, the combined system is degenerate; hence he used degenerate first-

 order perturbation theory in matrix mechanics to calculate the perturbed energy levels
 that lifted the degeneracies. Again he found noncombining + and • term systems
 whose energies were shifted by the perturbation. He then turned to Schrödinger's
 wave mechanics, and found that the corresponding wave functions must be either
 even or odd under exchange.208

 Heisenberg turned next to the problem of two identical electrons in a helium atom,
 for which the perturbation was the Coulomb interaction between the two electrons.

 207 Heisenberg (1926a, p. 416).

 208 Heisenberg^ physical picture, "resonance," envisioned the two identical systems exchanging energy,
 in analogy to the normal modes of his coupled oscillators. In the case of the helium atom, he even raised

 tentatively the possibility of the two electrons constantly changing positions. See Carson (1996).

 The • and + states corresponded to parahelium and orthohelium respectively; inter-
 combinations were "for the time being" completely prohibited. He then introduced
 spin, and noted (in what has become a standard textbook result) that for the two-elec-

 tron system, there should be one antisymmetric and three symmetric spin states - the

 latter thus had a greater statistical weight. The resulting spin-orbit interaction, as it is
 called today, relaxed the prohibition and permitted weak intercombinations between
 para- and orthohelium.

 However, because spatial and spin states must combine to give the total symme-
 try of the system, Heisenberg was now faced with the prospect of two complete and
 independent para and ortho systems:

 The one system describes a term spectrum for which orthohelium is a triplet sys-

 tem, parahelium a singlet, the other a term spectrum for which orthohelium is a
 singlet system and parahelium a triplet. Intercombinations between parahelium

 and orthohelium are allowed . . . owing to the strength of the interaction between
 orbit and electron magnet. In contrast there are no intercombinations between
 the + and • systems.209

 Only one of these systems exists in nature; but which one? Heisenberg argued that the

 significance of Bose-Einstein counting was to reduce the n ! possibilities in classical
 theory to one; and the Pauli exclusion principle - the "ban of equivalent orbits" as
 Heisenberg called it - is "automatically satisfied" if the • system (corresponding to
 an antisymmetric total wave function) is chosen. In this way, he argued, both Bose-

 Einstein counting and the Pauli principle found a natural home in quantum mechanics.

 Heisenberg returned to this theme in his third paper of this series, dated Decem-

 ber 1926. But now the identical particles were nuclei in diatomic molecules. And the

 physical problem was the recently discovered presence of lines of alternating intensity

 in the electronic spectra of such diatomic molecules. He observed that no satisfactory

 solution had emerged in the old quantum theory, referring at one point to the "notorious

 quarter-quanta" that Gerhard Dieke had brought to bear on both alternating intensities

 and the specific heat of hydrogen.210

 Heisenberg's solution was to connect "the intensity alterations with a resonance in

 the nuclei."211 By introducing nuclear spin, he could create para and ortho systems
 analogous to those he had found for helium. Here, however, the critical feature was the

 different weights associated with symmetric and antisymmetric nuclear spin states.

 Those different weights would result in different transition probabilities among para

 and ortho nuclear spin states, and hence to the experimentally observed alternating
 intensities observed in molecular band spectra.

 Heisenberg proceeded much as he had done for helium. Using Schrödinger's wave-

 function language freely, he noted that the total molecular eigenfunction was the
 product of eigenfunctions for center-of-mass motion, nuclear oscillation, electronic

 motion, and nuclear rotation - he added nuclear spin later. The first two are always
 symmetric in the nuclear coordinates. The rotational wave function is symmetric for
 even rotational quantum numbers, antisymmetric for odd. Finally, the electronic wave

 function is either symmetric or antisymmetric under the exchange of nuclei, a result he

 credited to a work in press by his friend and colleague Friedrich Hund. Both physicists

 were at Bohr's Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen late in 1926 and early
 in 1927, and judging by their papers and later recollections, they were talking about
 this problem extensively.212

 Heisenberg first assumed that the two nuclei are "spherically symmetric" (that is,

 had no nuclear spin). Under these circumstances, for a given electronic state, either
 the odd or the even rotational states should be missing, since both the total and elec-

 tronic wave functions must be either odd or even. And indeed, as he pointed out,
 spectroscopists had seen such missing lines in the spectra of molecular helium and
 oxygen.

 Heisenberg then completed the analogy to helium by introducing nuclear spin. With

 this step, there were again two systems that could not combine, analogous to his earlier

 2,0 Heisenberg did not mention Dieke by name. See Van Vleck ( 1 926b), and Birge ( 1 926) for bibliography

 + and • states. As before, each one had weakly interacting para and ortho terms. He ten-

 tatively assumed spin- 1/2 nuclei and a totally antisymmetric wave function (analogous

 to •), "in order to make the analogy of the statistics of protons to electrons complete,"
 though he immediately added that "one cannot be certain which system is selected."
 Given his choice, transitions between ortho terms (odd rotational quantum number
 in the ground state), weighted more heavily by the nuclear-spin triplets, should be

 brighter than transitions between para states. As we have seen, such alternating inten-
 sities had already been observed for NÍ, and, Heisenberg added, "perhaps also with
 H2."213

 10 Friedrich Hund and the specific heat of hydrogen

 Friedrich Hund submitted his paper for publication in February 1927, only 2 months

 after Heisenberg^.214 Hund's paper was the third in a series of groundbreaking papers

 on molecular spectra, in which he combined the new quantum mechanics with a series

 of vector models for angular momentum and the beginnings of what became known
 as molecular orbital theory. Hund also investigated the symmetries that characterize
 diatomic molecules with both identical and dissimilar nuclei.215 His contributions in

 these papers remain staples of the textbook literature. It is thus ironic that, like so

 many others, he came to grief over the specific heat of hydrogen.

 After treating the properties of the electronic states of diatomic molecules with
 identical nuclei, Hund turned to the lines of alternating intensity that Heisenberg
 had previously discussed. Hund adopted an almost identical theoretical picture, not-

 ing for example that: " The intensity alterations signify that systems symmetric and
 also antisymmetric in the nuclei both appear, but with different statistical weights "

 [Hund's emphasis].216 Hund noted that by assuming "a new property of the nucleus"

 (unlike Heisenberg, he never spoke explicitly of nuclear spin), a particular total wave-

 function symmetry could be chosen. (In other words, the total wave function for the

 molecule, ^totai = ^electronic ^rotational ^nuclear, could be either odd or even under the

 exchange of nuclei.) Hund had already shown that for the ground state, ^electronic
 was even. Thus, just as Heisenberg had argued, odd and even rotational states were
 associated with odd and even nuclear wave functions, resulting in weakly combining

 para and ortho states whose different statistical weights, stemming from the different
 weights of the nuclear wave function, could explain the alternating intensities. But
 these different weights also had implications for the specific heat of hydrogen.

 213 Heisenberg (1927, pp. 264-265).

 214 Hund (1927).

 215 My brief summary here does not do justice to an exceedingly complex topic. The historical literature
 describing both the experimental and theoretical description of molecular spectra as it had developed in
 the mid- 1920s, including Hund's work, is comparatively sparse. But see Gavroglu and Simões (1994),
 Kutzelnigg (1996), Cassidy (2007), Mehra and Rechenberg (1982-2000, Vol. 6, Chapter 3), and Brand
 (1995, Chapters 1 1 and 12). For contemporary accounts, see Kemble et al. (1926), and Ruark and Urey

 Hund observed that although the lines of alternating intensity in singly ionized

 nitrogen had been seen, a nitrogen nucleus must be "a rather intricate structure," and

 that the investigation of the simpler hydrogen nucleus might be revealing:

 A determination of the properties of the hydrogen nucleus would be very inter-

 esting. An intensity alteration is perhaps present in the bands of the H2 molecule;

 but it is not wholly certain. But we have yet another criterion, the behavior of

 the specific heat of hydrogen at low temperatures. ...

 We will show in the following section that the empirical behavior of the specific
 heat of hydrogen can be explained if one assumes that the even rotation states

 of the ground term have an approximately doubled statistical weight....217

 Hund had thus shown, for the first time, how nuclear spin could affect the specific heat

 of hydrogen by forcing different weights for odd and even rotational states in the parti-

 tion function. But his assumption that the weights of the even rotational states were dou-

 ble those of the odd ones led him to conclude, in sharp contrast to Heisenberg^ tentative

 assumption, that the total wave function for the hydrogen molecule must be symmetric:

 Thus, if one wants to express the properties of hydrogen nuclei so that only one of

 the two symmetry systems appears, then one must assume a new property of the

 nucleus and further assume that only term systems symmetric in the nuclei [my
 emphasis] appear. It therefore shows a different behavior from two electrons.218

 This choice was entirely empirical. Hund's partition function took the form:

 Q = ß( (2m + l)e-Em/kT' + ^ (2 m + l)e~Em/kT, (39)

 'm even / m odd

 where ß is the ratio of even-to-odd rotational states. He calculated the specific heat
 in the usual way. Note his implicit assumption: weak intercombinations between odd

 and even rotational states maintained thermal equilibrium as the temperature changed.

 In what must have been tedious arithmetic calculations, he plotted the specific heat
 for at least nine values of ß ranging from zero to infinity, and found that:

 [The] theoretical curve with ß = 2 satisfactorily describes the empirical results.

 Naturally we can not infer exactly ß = 2 from the curves; thus for example the
 departure is also not very large with ß = 3.219

 As he did not point out but surely knew, these values of ß are the appropriate choices

 for a symmetric total wave function and nuclear spin 1 and 1/2, respectively.220 This

 22^ In general, ß > 1 implies symmetric total wave functions, ß < 1 anti-symmetric ones. Heisenberg,
 for example, had found that for two spin one-half particles, there would be one antisymmetric and three
 symmetric spin states. But for a totally antisymmetric wave function, symmetric (even) rotational states
 are combined with antisymmetric (odd) nuclear spin states, and vice versa; so in Heisenberg^ version,

 of a symmetric total wave function. Finally, his value for the moment of inertia of the

 with odd, to give a symmetric total wave function. Both Hund and Heisenberg understood these points;
 they did not yet know the connection between spin and statistics, and did not know which symmetry was
 obeyed by the hydrogen molecule.

 22 * Note, however, that Hund's curve (Fig. 8) has a large positive slope at room temperature. Had Hund

 plotted his theoretical curve at higher temperatures, he would have discovered that it continued to rise to a
 peak about 20% above the equipartition value around 450 К before converging to the equipartition value
 at still higher temperatures. As far as I know, no one noticed this behavior at the time. Hund's curve was
 rejected for other reasons; see below.

 Nevertheless, Hund knew of one potential cloud on the horizon. After his detailed

 discussion of alternating intensities and just before he presented his specific-heat cal-

 culations, we find the following enigmatic remark:

 The term systems of the H2 molecule given by Dieke and Hopfield, together with

 an analysis of the band structure that Hori has carried out with the bands of Wer-

 ner and Witmer, have not yet been brought into agreement with the theoretical
 statements made here.222

 11 Experimental molecular spectroscopy and the moment of inertia of hydrogen

 To understand Hund's observation, we must turn to electronic transitions in molecular

 spectra and their relation to moments of inertia. The moment of inertia is a free param-

 eter in models of the specific heat of hydrogen. We have seen how theorists, beginning
 with Einstein and Ehrenfest, chose values that brought theory and observations into
 agreement at the lowest temperatures. But molecular moments of inertia could also
 be measured directly, in the combined electronic, vibrational, and rotational transi-
 tions in molecular spectra of diatomic molecules. Such transitions are seen even in

 diatomic molecules like hydrogen, which do not show vibration-rotation spectra since
 they have no electric dipole moment.223 Such measurements thus offered a second and

 independent route to the moment of inertia of the hydrogen molecule. Both Tolman and

 Schrödinger compared their own estimates with ones drawn from molecular spectra.

 Throughout the early and mid- 1920s, as Table 1 shows, values drawn from specific

 heat models and molecular spectra were at least roughly consistent. That apparent
 agreement, however, did not last. To understand why, and to see how a new value

 emerged, we must understand in more detail the difficulties in interpreting the spec-
 trum of molecular hydrogen.

 The study of molecular band spectra, particularly in the visible and ultraviolet,
 predates quantum theory. By 1920, it was understood that "bands" - diffuse and

 apparently continuous structures with a sharp "head" at one end - corresponded to

 electronic transitions (Fig. 9a). It had also become widely accepted that energy differ-
 ences between electronic states were larger than those separating vibrational states,
 and that those differences were in turn larger than those separating rotational states.224

 A particular band represents a transition between different vibrational levels in

 different electronic states. Sophisticated measurements and techniques of data anal-
 ysis allowed spectroscopists to identify "progressions" and "sequences" of bands
 corresponding to transitions between different vibrational levels of the same pair of

 electronic states. Moreover, under higher resolution, the seemingly continuous bands

 turn out to consist of closely spaced sharp lines - transitions involving different rota-

 tional states (Fig. 9b). Just as in the case of the infrared vibration-rotation spectra

 222 Hund (1927, p. 117).

 223 Moments of inertia can be inferred from the vibration-rotation spectra discussed in Sect. 6. However,

 these vibration-rotation spectra, which do not involve electronic transitions, are seen only in molecules that,
 like HCl, have nonzero electric-dipole moments.

 Fig. 9 a Top is a portion of the band spectrum of molecular nitrogen, from Foote and Möhler (1922,
 p. 1 92 A), b Bottom is a graph of the rotational structure of a band, called a Fortrat diagram, from Sommerfeld
 (1922, ch. 7, Sect. 3). Note how the lines of one branch not only become more closely spaced, as in Fig. 5,

 but reach a sharp head (shown in Fig. 9a) and then reverse direction

 discussed in Sect. 6 (which do not involve electronic transitions), the spacing of these
 lines allowed the calculation of moments of inertia.

 The differences between moments of inertia in different electronic states are, how-

 ever, much larger than those that accompany the variable spacing of lines in vibra-
 tion-rotation spectra. As a result, the frequencies of one "branch" - the frequencies of
 rotational lines on one side or the other of the central vibrational state - typically reach

 a sharp "head" at a particular frequency and then reverse direction (Fig. 9b). The data

 analysis was correspondingly difficult - spectroscopists had to determine which lines
 corresponded to which branches, taking into account the possibility of overlapping
 and missing lines.225

 These difficulties pale in comparison to those involved in the measurement and inter-

 pretation of "the many-lined spectrum of hydrogen." In addition to the better-known

 and comparatively simple spectrum of atomic hydrogen, experiments on hydrogen

 show thousands of lines in the visible and ultraviolet. These lines are widely spaced
 and do not show diffuse bands or band heads, but were nevertheless associated with

 molecular hydrogen.226 By 1913, the American spectroscopist Gordon Fulcher had

 found two groups of lines that suggested the regularities found in band spectra.227 But

 detailed interpretation proved difficult and controversial. By early 1926, a dizzying
 array of competing and mutually exclusive approaches attempted to explain both these
 "Fulcher bands" and more recently measured lines.

 Not surprisingly, the resulting estimates of the moment of inertia for hydrogen,

 some of which are given in Table 1, were uncertain - in retrospect, it is surprising

 that they were compared so widely to values inferred from specific-heat models. One

 early and indirect estimate was based on the ratio of line spacings in cyanogen and the
 Fulcher bands.228 Other, more direct estimates followed, but by 1926 the consensus

 suggested by Table 1 was breaking down, with some analyses suggesting moments of

 inertia for hydrogen up to an order of magnitude larger.229

 To make matters worse, none of these lines had been seen in absorption. As a

 result, nothing was known of the moment of inertia of hydrogen in the ground state,
 so that as Schrödinger and others had pointed out, spectroscopic values could not be

 compared directly to those inferred from models for the specific heat of hydrogen.

 Indeed, hydrogen was notorious for its lack of an absorption spectrum in the far ultra-

 violet, the region in which both atomic and molecular transitions to the ground state
 were anticipated. Theodore Lyman, who had pioneered the study of far-ultraviolet

 spectroscopy, observed in 1914 that: "the transparency of hydrogen [is] uncommonly

 great. Upon this observation is based the procedure of washing vacuum spectroscopic
 apparatus with this gas."230 His observation reminds us that air absorbs strongly in

 the ultraviolet, so that spectroscopy must be done under a vacuum; as Lyman ruefully
 noted in 1922:

 The spectroscopy of the extreme ultra-violet combines all the difficulties inherent

 in the nice adjustment of delicate optical apparatus with those which accompany
 the production and maintenance of high vacua in metallic containers of large
 volume.231

 If anything, Lyman understated the difficulties. The preparation of photographic
 plates was an art. The source could not be separated from the spectrometer - even

 quartz and fluorite windows were far too absorptive at the shortest wavelengths. It was

 difficult to find sources that emitted a uniform, continuous spectrum for absorption

 spectroscopy. And so on. Given this experimental complexity, ultraviolet spectroscopy

 developed slowly. Lyman reported the first two lines of his series in atomic hydrogen

 only in his 1914 book, and the third a year later. He did not see them in absorption
 until 1926.232

 The spectrum of molecular hydrogen in the ultraviolet presented similar challenges.

 Lyman observed in 1914 that, "Hydrogen surpasses all other gases in the wealth and

 strength of [emission] lines" in the ultraviolet, and immediately added that this spec-

 trum "has defied analysis up to the present time."233 A few pages later, he reported
 that measurements in which traces of hydrogen were mixed with argon produced a

 much less complex spectrum, in which he identified five band-like groups of lines.234

 But neither he nor anyone else attempted an analysis.

 Thus, although some physicists tried to justify specific-heat models for hydrogen

 by comparing them to moments of inertia drawn from molecular spectra, others were
 less sanguine. Van Vleck, for example, after a careful and knowledgeable discussion
 unsurprising for a student of Kemble, concluded glumly that:

 At any rate the hydrogen secondary spectrum is so complicated and difficult to

 interpret that it does not as yet appear to furnish any conclusive evidence against
 any of the various specific heat curves ...,235

 although he added enigmatically that:

 It is quite probable, however, that spectroscopists of the ultra-violet will soon be

 able to supply the moment of inertia of the normal state of the hydrogen mole-
 cule and so definitely determine the correct value for use in calculating specific
 heats.236

 The American spectroscopist Raymond Birge also gave a careful summary in the 1926
 National Research Council review of molecular spectra, and was if anything even more

 pessimistic:

 A number of investigators are now working on the hydrogen spectrum, and many

 papers on the subject have appeared during the past few years; but as the con-
 clusions of various investigators are very conflicting, even in regard to the most

 fundamental points, we shall merely summarize as briefly as possible the main
 points at issue....237

 It was thus a very big deal indeed when in August, 1926, John Joseph Hopfield

 and Gerhard Dieke, at the University of California in Berkeley, measured numerous

 bands of molecular hydrogen in both emission and absorption. They sent a preliminary

 report to Nature within 24 h, as Raymond Birge excitedly reported to Kemble later

 that month. Other, more detailed reports followed shortly.238

 As an undergraduate, Hopfield had met Birge at Syracuse University, and had

 followed him to California. He completed his Ph.D. degree in 1923 in ultraviolet
 spectroscopy under the direction of E. Percival Lewis, but with the close cooperation
 of Birge, and went on to join the Berkeley faculty. Birge was enthusiastic in his sup-

 port. In a 1929 letter to Van Vleck, he exclaimed that Hopfield "is doing probably the

 best vacuum spectroscopy of anyone in the world."239

 Dieke had been a student of Ehrenfest in Leiden, where he had earned a master's

 degree ( Doctorandus ). He had already published several widely read theoretical papers

 on molecular spectroscopy and one on the specific heat of hydrogen. He had come to

 California in 1925 intending to study the ultraviolet bands of hydrogen, as he related
 to Kemble in a May 1926 letter.240 His work with Hopfield was also the subject of
 his Ph.D. dissertation. Their collaboration was not always smooth; Birge tells us that
 "anyone who knew these two personally could guess that such a joint effort would
 not last very long." In fact, Birge became Dieke's advisor, and must have managed
 somehow to smooth over troubled waters.241

 Exactly what factors that led to their success is unclear. Among the possibilities

 were the use of Lyman's new method of generating a continuous ultraviolet source for
 absorption measurements; the use of two separate vacuum systems, so that the dis-

 charge tube and the spectrometer could be maintained at different pressures; Hopfield's

 new methods of preparing films; and observations over a wide range of pressures, as
 well as the use of the simpler spectrum Lyman had found using a trace of hydro-
 gen in an argon atmosphere to guide the interpretation of more complex spectra in
 increasingly pure hydrogen.

 In his May letter to Kemble, Dieke had said that although he had not yet succeeded

 in developing a suitable continuous source for absorption measurements, he had seen
 numerous bands in emission. By August, the experimental obstacles had been over-

 come. Dieke and Hopfield's results were stunning. They identified roughly 50 separate
 bands, organized into a ground state (called A) and two excited electronic states ( В and
 C). Each electronic state contained numerous vibrational states; and each vibrational

 state contained numerous rotational states. Some dozen bands, involving transitions

 from either В or С to A , were measured in both absorption and emission. They identi-

 Birge also asked Kemble, perhaps a bit apprehensively, if Lyman had also seen absorption bands. Birge
 added a note in proof to Birge (1926, pp. 214-215) reporting these developments.

 fied the bands Lyman had found in 1914 as transitions from the n = 3 vibrational state

 of В to the ground state A. They summarized all of this information in an energy-level

 diagram (shown in Fig. 10). They did not, however, analyze the rotational structure of
 these bands, saying only that "a discussion ... is reserved for another paper."

 Earlier in 1926, Enos Witmer, who was working for Kemble as a National Research

 Council fellow after completing his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1924,
 reported seven additional bands that Lyman had measured in emission in 1925 but
 had not published.242 Witmer showed that these bands (also a subset, it transpired, of
 Dieke and Hopfield's Z?-to-A transitions) all began on the same vibrational state; and

 he strongly suspected that they ended on the ground state (or "normal" state, as it was

 often called). He gave a preliminary analysis of the rotational structure, but made no

 attempt to calculate a moment of inertia. Witmer abandoned plans for further work
 on these bands after learning of Dieke and Hopfield's more comprehensive results,
 according to a letter from Kemble to Dieke in June, 1926.243

 Yet another experiment appeared on the scene that summer. In August 1926, Sven

 Werner, a spectroscopist working at Niels Bohr's institute in Copenhagen, reported

 242 Witmer (1926a,b). Witmer spent most of his subsequent career in the Physics Department at the Uni-

 versity of Pennsylvania. In 1928, he was a coauthor with Eugene Wigner of an important paper on molecular
 symmetries and molecular spectra, Wigner and Witmer (1928).

 243 Kemble to Dieke, 14 June 1926, AHQP microfilm reel 51. Kemble noted that he had been hoping

 to analyze the Lyman bands for some time, but that there had been no opportunity to do so until Witmer
 appeared on the scene. Dieke had previously told Kemble that he had not known of the Lyman bands until
 he saw Witmer's first paper, well after his own work was underway (footnote 240).

 finding a number of new emission bands in the far ultraviolet that turned out to cor-
 respond to Dieke and Hopfield's C-to-A transitions.244 Werner by his account had
 stumbled across these lines in a study of the ultraviolet spectra of lithium and other

 elements, in which the hydrogen lines at first "proved to be a very distracting impu-
 rity...." His analysis was at best preliminary; at one point he said flatly that, "No
 satisfactory explanation of the bands has yet been found." He nevertheless undertook

 a provisional rotational analysis, and without giving much detail, reported a value for

 the moment of inertia in the ground state in the range of 2 to 3 x 10~41 gm cm2. This
 value did not, however, hold up.

 Werner's paper serves to remind us that that in spite of its name, Bohr's Institute for

 Theoretical Physics had from its earliest days supported an active and well-equipped

 spectroscopy laboratory.245 It is therefore no surprise to find Takeo Hori, a young Jap-

 anese spectroscopist visiting Europe on a grant from the Japanese government, writing

 to Bohr from Berlin, in May 1926, giving an account of himself, and asking to visit

 the Copenhagen laboratory. To Hori's delight, Bohr invited him to come the following
 September, since the laboratory would be closed over the summer for reconstruction.

 Hori promptly accepted: "Now that my destination is settled, I can freely enjoy the
 coming three months. ... I shall be in Copenhagen by the end of August."246

 At Bohr's suggestion, Hori took on the task of remeasuring and reanalyzing the

 Werner bands. He also reanalyzed the new Lyman bands recently published by Wit-

 mer. And he did so in the context of the path-breaking paper of Dieke and Hopfield,
 which appeared while Hori's own work was in progress. Hori's work took nearly a
 year; his paper was submitted to the Zeitschrift für Physik in July 1927.247 Hori's
 acknowledgments, not only of Bohr, but also of Hund, David Dennison, Erwin Fues,

 and Yoshio Nishina (all of whom were then in Copenhagen), suggest that these devel-
 opments were widely discussed at Bohr's Institute.

 Hori carefully described his extensive reanalysis of both the Lyman and Werner

 bands, and in the process gave the first detailed analysis of the rotational structure of

 the H2 ultraviolet bands. The resulting value for the moment of inertia of a hydrogen

 molecule in the ground state, 4.67 x 10~41 gm cm2, was more than triple Hund's value.

 Hori also saw rotational lines of alternating intensity in the Werner bands (though not
 in the Lyman bands),248 and, as he pointed out in a long footnote, his observations
 directly contradicted Hund's assumptions:

 [Hund] obtains ß = 2, that is, the . . . [even] rotational states of the ground term
 have approximately twice the statistical weight as the . . . [odd] rotational states.

 This does not agree with the result obtained from the analysis of the bands, which
 makes it necessary to adopt a value ß < 1.

 245 See for example Bohr's speech at the dedication of his Institute on 3 March 1921 , in Bohr (1972-1996,
 Vol. 3, 293-301, esp. p. 296); see also Robertson (1979, esp. pp. 41-47). A photograph of Takeo Hori is on

 In other words, Hunďs choice ( ß = 2, symmetric total wave function) implied that
 transitions between symmetric rotational states should be brighter; Hori's observa-
 tions showed just the opposite: transitions between antisymmetric rotational states are

 brighter, implying ß < 1 and an antisymmetric total wave function.

 As the quotation at the end of Sect. 10 shows, Hund was puzzled by Hori's results. I

 do not know how complete those results were in February 1927, when Hund submitted

 his paper, but Dennison may have known the previous December that a reanalysis of

 the Werner bands was yielding a considerably larger moment of inertia than Werner

 originally had reported. Whatever the case, Hund's failure to discuss Hori's results at

 more length remains a mystery.

 The reception of Hori's remarkable experimental work owed something to its

 location in Copenhagen, where it was immediately relevant to Heisenberg 's and Hund's

 theoretical work on identical particles and the hydrogen problem. The importance of

 this connection may be seen in the reception (or lack thereof) of a parallel analysis
 by the British physicist Owen W. Richardson. Richardson, who would win the Nobel
 Prize in 1928 for his work on thermionic emission, published in 1924 the first in a

 long series of papers on the many-lined spectrum of hydrogen, primarily in the visible.

 His work eventually led to a more complete understanding and integration of the vis-

 ible and ultraviolet spectrum of molecular hydrogen, summarized in his 1934 book,
 Molecular Hydrogen and Its Spectrum.

 In 1926 and 1927, drawing on his own work in the visible, and on that of Werner,

 Witmer, and Dieke and Hopfield, Richardson used an indirect method to estimate the

 moment of inertia of a hydrogen molecule in the ground state, and found a value about
 the same as Hori's. Nevertheless, Hori's result was (and still is) almost exclusively

 cited. Richardson seemed a little put out. In his book, he spent several pages describing
 his own results, and concluded dryly that: "Hori's value..., got from his analysis of

 the Werner and Lyman bands, was also published about the same time."249

 12 David Dennison and the specific heat of hydrogen

 In 1924, David Dennison completed his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan under the
 direction of Walter Colby and Oskar Klein, the latter newly arrived from Niels Bohr's

 institute in Copenhagen. From Klein, Dennison learned the latest developments in
 quantum theory at firsthand. Harrison Randall, whom we met earlier as Elmer Imes's
 dissertation supervisor, was continuing to build the program in molecular spectroscopy

 at Michigan. Dennison's thesis on the structure and infrared spectrum of methane con-

 tinued that tradition. Perhaps more surprising, his was the first theoretical dissertation
 at the University of Michigan. Dennison later said that Randall was "very uneasy"

 about this prospect, but that "there was no putting me off."250

 Bohr visited Michigan late in 1923, during his first visit to the United States. That

 visit resulted in an invitation for Dennison to come to Copenhagen. Dennison jumped
 at the chance:

 184 С. A. Gearhart

 At this time it was decided I would go to Copenhagen. Just how I was to go, this

 was another question. But I was absolutely positive I was going. There was just
 no question.251

 Dennison set out for Copenhagen in the fall of 1924 and stayed through the spring of
 1926; he thus saw the birth of matrix mechanics at firsthand. He continued to work on

 molecular spectroscopy; one paper that combined these themes, suggested to him by

 Hendrik Kramers, gave a detailed treatment of both the rigid and gyroscopic rotator

 in matrix mechanics. In later years, he proudly recalled that it was the first paper on
 matrix mechanics published in the Physical Review .252 At some point, he became
 interested in the specific heat of hydrogen. Heisenberg later recalled talking to him
 about it,253 and Dennison himself recalled that:

 Oh yes, I certainly had thought about the specific heat much earlier, and how it

 would be related to the spectra and to the moment of inertia.

 [It] was a problem I was thinking about . . . some [problems] came out and some

 didn't, and this was one that hadn't come through.254

 Dennison returned to the United States in the summer of 1926, but that fall set sail

 again for Europe, this time to work with Erwin Schrödinger in Zurich. Just as his visit
 was ending in December, he submitted a two-page letter to Nature on the rotation

 of homopolar (identical nuclei) molecules, which appeared at the end of February
 1927.255 Dennison later described this article as "showing my state of confusion more
 than anything else."256 His assessment was far too harsh. The article showed him

 puzzling over both the specific heat of hydrogen and the lines of alternating intensity,

 and embarking on an insightful if as yet incomplete train of reasoning that bore fruit
 only a few months later.

 Dennison began by recalling John C. Slater's argument, about a year earlier, that if

 one used Sommerfeld's quantum condition, Eq. (24), to quantize the angular momen-
 tum of homopolar molecules, the angular period should be only 1 80° instead of a full
 360°, since the molecule "returns after half a revolution to a state which cannot be

 told from its initial state. ..." Slater's condition implied that every other rotational line

 should be missing, as was suspected to be the case for molecular helium. He speculated

 that a "continuous kind of transition to the case of the non-symmetrical rotator" might

 account for the lines of alternating intensities seen in molecular nitrogen. A detailed

 theory along these lines might well have emerged in the old quantum theory, had not
 modern quantum mechanics intervened.257

 Dennison took up Slater's suggestion in the language of Schrödinger's new wave
 mechanics, in which he was by now fluent. The wave functions for the rigid rotator

 are the spherical harmonics, which are either odd or even depending on whether the
 rotational quantum number is odd or even, when a molecule undergoes a rotation of
 180° - equivalent, of course, to an exchange of nuclei. Dennison pointed out that if
 the wave function was single- valued (or even, as we would say today) under a 180°

 rotation, then only even rotational quantum numbers would be allowed. But as he also

 pointed out, such a conclusion appeared inconsistent with the spectrum of molecular
 helium. Just as bad, the specific heat of hydrogen calculated with only even rotational

 quantum numbers showed the peak that had puzzled theorists for years.

 Dennison suggested as an alternative the requirement that the absolute square of the

 wave function be single-valued, arguing that such an assumption is: "more nearly in

 accord with the spirit of the new mechanics, since the function х/гф seems to represent

 the electrical density, whereas the function '¡/ alone has no such physical meaning."258

 Under this assumption either odd or even solutions would be admissible. However, as
 he went on to state without proof, the solutions for odd and even rotational quantum

 numbers were: "each complete in themselves and admit of no intercombination, [and]
 seem to correspond respectively to the symmetrical and antisymmetrical solutions
 found by Dirac and Heisenberg. . .." In short, Dennison had followed a path similar to

 Heisenberg. But without the latter's assumption of a nuclear spin that allowed weakly

 combining odd and even rotational states, he concluded that only one set might actually
 exist. Dennison thus seems to have come across a special case of what would become

 a much more general argument: the invariance of x/sý under exchange of indistin-

 guishable particles implies that тД itself must be either symmetric or antisymmetric, a
 derivation now found routinely in textbooks, but as far as I know, still unknown late
 in 1926.259

 Dennison stated without giving any detail that odd rotational quantum numbers

 were consistent with the helium bands.260 He also calculated the specific heat of

 257 Slater (1926, p. 555); see also Ehrenfest and Tolman (1924) and Birge (1926, pp. 204-209). Kemble,
 with whom Slater had studied at Harvard, praised Slater's approach in letters to Van Vleck, 15 November

 1925, and to Raymond Birge, 26 March 1926, AHQP microfilm reel 50.

 258 jsjote Dennison was following Schrödinger's interpretation of ''//' . If he knew of Max Born's

 probabilistic interpretation that had appeared in the summer of 1926, he said nothing about it.

 Dennison's later accounts do not do justice to this argument. His discussion of this paper in his AHQP

 interview (footnote 250), session 3 (30 January 1964), pp. 10-1 1, is not very detailed, and his recollections

 of it did not seem to be sharp. He went into more detail in both an unpublished talk at the University of
 Michigan in the late 1960s (Bentley Library, University of Michigan, Dennison Archive, Box 2) and in
 Dennison (1974); but there his discussion centered on a later section of the paper that outlined a solution of

 Schrödinger's equation for a rigid rotator involving half-quantum numbers. That section is, as far as I can
 tell, unrelated to the argument outlined above.

 The situation is in fact more complex. Hund (1927) made a start, but a full theory of the alternating

 intensity bands required a better understanding of molecular symmetries that developed over the next few
 years. See Mulliken (1931, pp. 146-155).

 hydrogen using only odd states, and found that the specific heat showed a steady
 rise, with no peak. His value for the moment of inertia using only odd states was

 6.7 X 10~41 . By way of confirmation, he referred to Sven Werner's discovery of new

 bands in the far ultraviolet, for which he quoted a moment of inertia in the ground

 state of 6 X 10~41 - much larger than the value that Werner had reported and larger
 even than Hori's still-unpublished value. Perhaps Dennison had been in touch with
 the spectroscopists in Copenhagen, and knew that Werner's published estimate was
 being superseded by Hori's.

 Thus, motivated by his discovery that odd and even rotational states might be inde-

 pendent and noncombining, Dennison had for the first time calculated the specific-heat

 curve for odd and even rotational states separately and had seen their very different

 behavior. He stated - incorrectly - that the specific heat calculated with only the odd

 states gave a reasonable fit to the data, and closed by promising "a more detailed paper
 covering the calculations."261

 Dennison's short letter received mixed reviews. He had sent the manuscript to

 Bohr in Copenhagen, and in January 1927 got in return two letters from Oskar Klein.

 Klein said that he and Bohr had forwarded the paper to Nature , even though they
 had reservations about his assumption regarding 'fr'¡r. Klein also told Dennison about

 Heisenberg's December 1926 paper, which Klein held out as "the only solution ...
 which is rational from the point of view of quantum mechanics."262 He promised to
 send a copy as soon as proofs became available, and suggested that Dennison might
 want to make changes in proof to his own paper.

 Given this discouraging reaction, Dennison must have been pleased to receive a

 short letter from Ralph H. Fowler, whom he had come to know in Copenhagen, writ-
 ten almost immediately after Dennison's note had appeared. Fowler expressed his
 delight with the paper, agreed strongly with Dennison's suggestion that x/rý should

 be single-valued, and concluded by urging him to visit Cambridge before he returned
 home.263

 The spring of 1927 found Dennison in Cambridge, after a visit to Munich and
 a second stay in Copenhagen where, as he later recalled, he learned the details of

 Hori's experiments and analysis. In Cambridge, he turned again to the specific heat of
 hydrogen, and this time, he succeeded. As he later explained:

 261 In his February paper, Hund (1927) had also plotted the contribution to the specific heat from only the
 odd states, perhaps inspired by Dennison's Nature paper (1927a), which he cited in another connection. He
 found a value for the moment of inertia about the same as Dennison's, but also showed that the odd states

 alone did not adequately describe the data. Under these circumstances, it seems hard to imagine that Hund
 did not have an inkling of Hori's higher value for the moment of inertia - it makes his cryptic reference,
 quoted at the end of Section 1 0, seem all the more mysterious.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 1 87

 Fowler asked me to give three lectures to his graduate class. ... I could see that I

 was running out of material for the third lecture . . . and it occurred to me to take

 another crack at the problem of the specific heat of hydrogen.264

 By this time, Dennison had seen both Heisenberg^ and Hund's papers from the pre-
 vious December and February. He knew, therefore, that the introduction of nuclear
 spin allowed weakly combining odd and even states, contrary to his assumption in
 his Nature paper. He also had seen Hori's as yet unpublished results, including the
 new moment of inertia, and the observation of rotational lines of alternating intensity

 implying ß < 1 , in contrast to Hund's assumption of a symmetric total wave function
 and hence a ß > 1 .

 Dennison pointed out that Hori's results ruled out Hund's ß = 2 and his much
 smaller moment of inertia. Dennison added that if ß = 1 /3, Hund's theory led to

 an impossible curve, with a sharp peak rising well above the equipartition value. In
 other words, he knew that no value of Hund's ß would work as long as the ortho and

 para terms could combine, however weakly. Dennison 's conclusion appeared almost
 inevitable:

 [The] difficulties . . . may lie in the assumption that the symmetrical and anti-

 symmetrical terms can combine. ...

 Let us make the assumption that the time of transition between a state symmet-

 rical in the rotation, and an antisymmetrical state is very long compared with the

 time in which the observations of the specific heat are made.265

 Under these circumstances, one must treat hydrogen as a mixture of parahydrogen

 and orthohydrogen in the fixed, room-temperature ratio. Dennison said that Hori's
 alternating intensity measurements implied the ratio ß % 1/3, that is, three parts

 orthohydrogen (odd rotational states) to one part parahydrogen (even rotational states).

 (Hori had not given a specific value, noting only that ß must be less than one.266)

 As additional evidence, Dennison pointed out that only the even rotational states led

 to a peak, and therefore one would expect the odd states to contribute more strongly,
 in agreement with Hori's observations. He did not publish a graph (see Fig. II),267
 but a table showed that a ratio of 3 parts ortho to one part para led to "a specific heat
 curve which follows the observed curve to within the errors of observation, and that

 moreover the constants ... are in good agreement with the values . . . found in the band

 spectrum of H2."

 264 Dennison (1974, p. 1054). This story sounds too good to be true; but it is confirmed in a contemporary
 letter, Dennison to Bohr, 2 June 1927, AHQP, Bohr Scientific Correspondence, microfilm reel 9, in which
 Dennison told Bohr about his new result.

 265 Dennison (1927b, p. 484).

 266 Tomonaga (1997, p. 73), says that Hori had told Dennison that the intensity ratio was about 3:1, but

 gives no source. I have not seen this account elsewhere; but Tomonaga's book is historically sensitive, and,
 as it turns out, Hori was Tomonaga's brother-in-law!

 267 Dennison did make a careful graph, which, as he reported in the late 1960s, appeared nearly unchanged
 in Fowler's statistical mechanics textbook; see Fowler (1929, p. 54; 1936, p. 83). See Dennison's unpub-

 lished notes for a talk given circa 1968 at the University of Michigan (Bentley Library, University of
 Michigan, Dennison Archive, Box 2, p. 15).

 shown the data of Cornish and Eastman (1928), which did not appear until a year later

 Up to this point, Dennison had not explicitly mentioned the implications for spin

 and total wave-function symmetry, though he surely understood them; he could have

 arrived at his 3: 1 ratio in no other way. But in response to a suggestion from Bohr,268 to

 whom he had sent a draft, he added the comment that "the ratio of 3 to 1 of the antisym-

 metrical and symmetrical modifications of hydrogen ... is just what is to be expected

 if the nuclear spin is taken equal to that of the electron, and only the complete anti-

 symmetrical solution of the Schrödinger wave equation allowed." Many years later,
 he said that, "Somehow this point had seemed so obvious to me that it had not seemed

 worth belaboring."269

 In his letter to Dennison, Bohr expressed his delight that a solution to this longstand-

 ing problem had finally been found. Hori, writing to Bohr from Tübingen, was equally

 pleased to hear that his experimental results and analysis had found such striking con-
 firmation.270 As we have seen, Heisenberg, Hund, and Dennison, as well as Hori and
 the Copenhagen spectroscopists, had all been in Bohr's institute during these years,
 talking to one another and setting the stage for Dennison's discovery. We should not
 forget that Van Vleck, following developments at a distance in Minneapolis, had not
 seen the significance of Heisenberg^ first helium paper. And Richardson's 1926-1 927

 estimate of the moment of inertia of hydrogen drew almost no notice - even today, it

 is hardly ever cited. Mara Beller has argued that the dialogue among the leading actors
 was central to the discovery and interpretation of modern quantum mechanics.271 It

 was equally important in the story of the specific heat of hydrogen.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 1 89

 13 The experimentalists have the last word

 From the outset, Dennison's theory seemed enormously plausible. But were there in

 fact two varieties of molecular hydrogen? The existence of orthohelium and paraheli-
 um were supported by well-established spectroscopic measurements of the noncom-

 bining singlet and triplet term series. But in view of the difficulties in measuring the
 "many-lined spectrum" of hydrogen, some years were to pass before molecular spec-

 troscopists could confidently assert the existence of similar singlet and triplet term
 series in hydrogen.272 Nevertheless, Dennison's solution to a prominent and long-
 standing puzzle in quantum theory gave rise to an outburst of experimental activity.

 In contrast to helium, the thermal properties of orthohydrogen and parahydro-
 gen should be noticeably different, as Dennison's discovery of different specific-heat

 curves for odd and even rotational states might suggest. Experimentalists immediately

 set out to measure those properties. Kemble, for example, hoped to have a student main-
 tain a sample of hydrogen gas at liquid-air temperatures for a week or so, and see if

 the specific heat changed.273 Edward U. Condon made a similar suggestion to exper-
 imentalists at the University of California, only to discover, as William F. Giauque
 and Herrick L. Johnston reported, that the apparatus used by Robert E. Cornish and
 Ermon D. Eastman had already been "completely dismantled"; and measurements of
 the triple point after keeping hydrogen at the temperature of liquid air for over six
 months proved inconclusive.274

 A group of German physical chemists centered on Fritz Haber's Kaiser Wilhelm
 Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin was more successful. This group very much
 included Arnold Eucken, since 1919 a professor at the Technical University [Tech-
 nische Hochschule ] in Breslau, whose interest in the specific heat of hydrogen had

 never waned since his publication of the first measurements in 19 1 2.275 Reports of the

 first successful measurements appeared in two brief articles on the same page of the
 15 March 1929 issue of Die Naturwissenschaften. In the first, Karl-Friedrich Bonho-

 effer and Paul Harteck, two young physical chemists at Haber's institute, announced a

 new and innovative technique. Instead of the heat capacity, they measured the thermal

 conductivity of the gas by recording the temperature of a platinum wire in a container

 filled with hydrogen. The thermal conductivity is directly proportional to the specific
 heat, but thermal conductivity measurements can be made more quickly and conve-
 niently. Thus a higher thermal conductivity corresponded to the larger specific heat

 expected at most temperatures for parahydrogen.276

 Bonhoeffer and Harteck made their initial experiments at the temperature of liquid

 air. They found that at low pressures, hydrogen transformed very slowly to the new

 ortho-para ratio expected at this lower temperature (about 1:1). At higher pressures
 (several hundred atmospheres), however, the transformation (presumably accelerated

 through collisions) proceeded much more rapidly, achieving within a week the new

 equilibrium concentration. Equally important, they discovered that the presence of

 catalysts strongly accelerated the transformation. In perhaps their most striking result,

 they found that hydrogen adsorbed on activated charcoal at liquid-hydrogen temper-

 atures and then pumped off was transformed in a matter of minutes to the nearly pure

 parahydrogen expected at this low temperature. If stored carefully without impurities

 in a glass container, it remained stable for some weeks even at room temperatures.
 In the second article, Arnold Eucken took a more direct approach. Using an

 improved version of his 191 2 calorimeter, he and his assistant Kurt Hiller stored
 hydrogen under high pressure (about 50 atmospheres) for several weeks, periodically
 measuring its specific heat over the range 90-150 K. After about 2 weeks, their data

 matched the theoretical equilibrium concentration of 36% parahydrogen, a substantial
 increase over the 25% found in "ordinary" hydrogen. The crowning touch came in an

 experiment by Hiller and Klaus Clusius, another student of Eucken who went on to a

 distinguished career. They prepared a sample of 95% parahydrogen using Bonhoeffer
 and Harteck's activated charcoal technique and measured its specific heat up to about
 160 K, where the rotational specific heat was roughly 40% higher than the equipar-
 tition value seen at room temperature. In other words, their experiment had finally
 seen the peak in the specific heat of hydrogen that had haunted the imaginations of
 physicists and physical chemists since Paul Ehrenfest first came across it in 191 3.277

 In 1 932, the discovery of heavy hydrogen (now called deuterium) by Harold C. Urey

 and his associates led to additional and unexpected evidence for the new quantum-

 mechanical picture. Urey's discovery led to an outburst of experiments on the physical
 and chemical properties of this new isotope.278 In short order, measurements of the

 lines of alternating intensity in the molecular spectrum of heavy hydrogen showed
 that its nucleus obeyed Bose-Einstein statistics, and most likely had spin 1 . In con-
 sequence, in the ground state the ratio of even-to-odd rotational states should be 2:1,

 instead of the 1:3 ratio in ordinary hydrogen.

 Moreover, heavy hydrogen turned out to have an even smaller magnetic moment

 than ordinary hydrogen, so that transitions between odd and even rotational states

 should be even less frequent. As Dennison had first discovered, only transitions
 between even rotational states result in a peak in the specific heat. Hence this new

 even-to-odd ratio predicted a peak in the specific heat of D2. The possibility of an HD
 hydrogen molecule, in which the nuclei are not identical, also became apparent. Its
 rotational partition function is much the same as in the old quantum theory, with the
 same prediction of a peak in the specific heat.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 191

 The German physical chemists once again took the lead. Paul Harteck, along

 with two former students of Bonhoeffer, Adalbert and Ladislas Farkas, used the

 same thermal-conductivity techniques that Bonhoeffer and Harteck had pioneered, but

 adapted so that much smaller samples were needed.279 Their experiments confirmed
 the expected para-ortho conversion at various temperatures, and provided additional
 evidence that heavy hydrogen obeyed Bose-Einstein statistics and had spin 1 . They
 also investigated the reaction H2 + D2 ^ 2HD, confirming earlier estimates of the

 equilibrium constant for the reaction. These experiments were done at the University

 of Cambridge in England. The Farkas brothers were Hungarian Jews who had to leave

 Germany in 1933. They later went on to careers in Israel and the United States. But
 in 1934, they were at Cambridge, where they were joined by Harteck, who spent a
 year working with Ernest Rutherford learning nuclear physics. Rutherford assigned

 Harteck the task of preparing a sample of heavy hydrogen for the laboratory. Ironi-

 cally, Harteck would use his knowledge of heavy water and isotope separation in the
 German nuclear program in World War II.280

 Arnold Eucken was once more involved in the measurements of the specific heat

 of HD and D2, though this time indirectly. Eucken was by now the head of an insti-

 tute at the University of Göttingen. The experiments there were done by his former

 student Klaus Clusius and by Ernst Bartholomé, who had completed his Ph.D. degree
 at Eucken's new institute in 1931. Clusius and Bartholomé employed much the same

 technique that Eucken had pioneered in 1912, and acknowledged Eucken's support.
 It turns out to be impossible to obtain samples of pure HD; instead, they worked with
 two mixtures, one almost entirely D2 and HD, the other almost entirely H2 and HD.

 Since they could calculate the percentages of HD in each mixture from the equilibrium
 constant of the H2 + D2 ^ 2HD reaction, they could find the specific heats of D2 and

 HD separately. Their measurements confirmed the expected peaks in both.281

 14 "Astonishing Successes" and "Bitter Disappointment"

 Fritz Reiche had followed the quantum theory of rotating dumbbells from the begin-

 ning after receiving his Ph.D. in 1907. He contributed extensively to quantum theory
 himself, and wrote one of the earliest quantum textbooks. He had watched as (among

 others) Einstein, Ehrenfest, and Planck, his Ph.D. supervisor, had tackled the specific

 heat of hydrogen. His own encyclopedic 1919 paper left little enough for others to do in

 the old quantum theory; later attempts consisted in large part of applying half-quanta
 to the theory that Reiche had laid out.282 Physicists remained faced with a blatant

 discrepancy between theory and experiment. They never lost sight of the problem and

 earlier; but I doubt that anyone besides Van Vleck knew the full scope of what Kemble had accomplished.

 talked about it extensively; but, as Schrödinger's 1924 contribution might suggest,

 they had little idea what to try next. The rotator, at bottom, remained a straightfor-

 ward textbook problem that offered little scope for innovation. Perhaps for that reason,

 the founders of modern quantum mechanics, centered on Göttingen and Copenhagen,

 never took up the problem in the old quantum theory. Recall, for example, how Born,

 in his 1 925 textbook, analyzed most of the pressing problems in quantum theory in

 great detail, but nevertheless dismissed the specific heat of hydrogen with a few sum-
 mary paragraphs and a reference to Reiche's 1919 paper.283 Problems such as the
 helium atom, the Zeeman effect, and dispersion offered more scope for theoretical
 speculation. That state of affairs changed only with the advent of modern quantum
 mechanics in 1925.

 Reiche never lost interest in the specific heat of hydrogen. His undated Breslau

 lecture notes, probably from 1928, contain calculations based on Dennison's paper
 and a careful graph.284 A year or so earlier, in February 1927, Reiche had written
 John Van Vleck to acknowledge receipt of copies of Van Vleck's and Hutchisson's

 papers.285 In that letter, Reiche ruefully observed that neither the gyroscopic model of

 his student Hans Lessheim, nor Van Vleck's model discarding the lowest energy state

 seemed likely solutions. But he had little else to offer, apart from a passing reference
 to Hund's paper - if he saw the promise of Heisenberg's and Hund's new quantum-
 mechanical treatment of identical particles, he nevertheless said nothing about it. And

 Van Vleck himself had made no more than a passing reference to Heisenberg's first
 helium paper.

 These reactions help us see why the problem of the specific heat of hydrogen defied

 solution for so long, despite enormous and wide-ranging theoretical and experimental

 efforts. Very often the old quantum theory pointed the way, however obscurely, to

 its successor. For example, the half-quantum numbers first introduced by Heisenberg
 and Kratzer, and independently by Reiche and Einstein, seemed incomprehensible at

 first. But they worked, and eventually found a natural explanation in modern quantum

 mechanics. Such examples as Pauli 's "ban of equivalent orbits," the attempts to under-
 stand the statistical mechanics of ideal gases, and approaches such as Slater's show
 the increased interest in identical particles that emerged during the early and mid-
 19208. Slater's theory might eventually have led to a successful explanation of both
 alternating intensities and the specific heat of hydrogen, though it surely would have

 had the same empirical and mysterious flavor as half-quanta. All the same, nothing
 like Heisenberg's and Dirac's new theory of identical particles ever appeared in the
 old quantum theory; the initial failure of such capable theorists as Reiche and Van

 Vleck to recognize its central importance shows us just how novel and unexpected
 it was. Hund and Dennison, by contrast, who witnessed the development of the new
 quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's theory of identical particles in intimate detail,
 saw immediately their relevance to the hydrogen problem.

 "Astonishing successes" and "bitter disappointment" 193

 This long and complex story, which began with Walther Nernst in 1911 and con-

 tinued for more than 20 years, gives us a new and complementary perspective on the

 successes and failures of the old quantum theory and its eventual replacement by mod-

 ern quantum mechanics. The rotating dumbbell, applied to both molecular hydrogen

 and molecular spectra, provided much of the early evidence for quantum theory. It also
 led to a stream of theoretical and experimental discoveries in molecular physics that
 showed both the possibilities and the limitations of the old quantum theory; and, by

 showing how the quantum statistics of indistinguishable particles led to the solution of

 a long-standing problem, it lent additional insight into the nature of today's quantum

 mechanics. The story reminds us that the history of early quantum theory extends far

 beyond its better known applications to atomic physics.
