 Abstract The widely accepted supposition that Newton's De gravitatione was writ-
 ten in 1684/5 just before composing the Principia is examined. The basis for this
 determination has serious difficulties starting with the failure to examine the numer-
 ical estimates for the resistance of aether. The estimated range is not nearly nil as
 claimed but comparable with air at or near the earth's surface. Moreover, the evidence

 provided most likely stems from experiments by Boyle, Hooke, and others in the 1660s
 and does not use evidence available in the late 1684. The document supports Newton's

 contention that the aether medium incorporates very large voids thereby proving that
 body and space differ but does by no means completely reject its corporeal nature
 or eliminate its resistance. Newton's use of the term inertia provides no conclusive
 evidence for a late date as often claimed and his definition of gravitas is difficult to
 reconcile with a late one.

 1 Introduction

 Henry (201 1) has brought the debate about the date of Newton's untitled manuscript

 familiarly known as De gravitatione full circle. Its date for a long time was believed
 by most scholars to be the late 1660s or the early 1670s. Works since the 1980s cul-
 minating in Dobbs (1991) built a case for its date to be from around January 1684/5
 during the early stages of formulating the Principia. Many scholars follow her lead,
 placing its date more vaguely around the early or mid- 1680s, although presumably
 still in association with Newton's masterpiece. Henry shows such circumstances to be

 unlikely, favoring a date around 1668 as originally offered by Hall and Hall (1962).
 This study supports no particular date but strengthens the case for a date prior to
 Halley's epoch-making visit of August 1684. Some background is needed.

 The opening sentence states De Gravitatione et aequipondiofluidorum etsolidorum

 in fluidis scientiam duplici methodo tradere convertit (It is appropriate to relate the

 knowledge of the heaviness and equilibrium of fluids and of solid bodies in fluids by
 a twofold method). The document starts and ends as an unfinished tract on hydrostat-

 ics.1 After an introduction and four definitions, on page 2 Newton launches a 29-page

 anti-Cartesian metaphysical digression before returning inconclusively to the topic for

 10 more pages. Gravitation, in accordance with the subsequent definition of gravitas,

 is used in the sense of weight or endeavor to press down by a body's "imparted" force
 (vis corpori indita). The vis indita of a fluid presses in any direction not just down
 toward the center of the earth. The document provides the first known uses of the
 term inertia to denote the natural endeavor of a body to maintain its state of motion

 or rest as well as the term quantitates materiae in relation to density. The twofold
 method frames abstract propositions said to be sufficiently well known to the student

 with freer discussion of natural phenomena and experiments so that their usefulness

 may be made apparent. The promised Scholia with abundant illustrative experiments
 to confirm the propositions are not realized. It does, however, include a key section at

 the end of the digression that alludes to various conditions and experiments which I
 dub the "resistance Scholium."

 Hall and Hall (1962, p. 90) note the striking connections with the Principia (1687)

 and later documents but date it in the 1660s or 1672 at the latest based on immaturity

 of some thoughts, the tightness of the handwriting, and other features.2 Koyré (1965,
 p. 83), Herivel (1965, pp. 92-93), and Whiteside (1970, p. 12) also cite the handwrit-

 ing, the immaturity of some thought, or other evidence of youth in dating it between

 1668 and 1673. Westfall (1971b, p. 403, n. 26) agrees with the handwriting assessment

 and later ( 1 975, pp. 2 1 7-2 1 8) argues that the emphasis on active principles within pas-
 sive matter and the corresponding treatment of forces matches other work in the late
 1660s, which was laid aside until the De motu tracts of late 1684. The Halls consider

 the unfinished treatment of hydrostatics worthless but Shapiro (1974, pp. 241-242)

 1 Cambridge University Library (CUL) Ms. Add. 4003. The document was first published with translation
 and commentary by Hall and Hall (1962) followed by extracts and further comments from Herivel (Newton
 1965a). A partial revision of the Hall translation lacking the final section on non-elastic fluids has been

 published by Janiak (2004). A facsimile of the manuscript with German translation has been published by
 Böhme (1988). The Latin text posted on line by the Newton Project (THEM00093) includes both "dip-
 lomatic" style with all of Newton's deletions and other changes and its final "normalized" state. Biarnais
 (1985) provides a French translation and commentary.

 Hall and Hall also note Newton's habit of using notebooks for his early work and loose sheets for later
 work. Given the jumble of heavily overwritten loose sheets associated with other work in the winter of

 1684/5, it is difficult to imagine him sitting down to draft, or better to compile, a tract in a notebook with-

 out the assistance of Humphrey Newton, his amanuensis from about 1684 to 1689. Nevertheless, many of
 those loose sheets are from what might be termed Newton's "waste basket" because they represent work
 in progress that contain errors or need further development while notebooks generally contain work to be
 preserved. A theological notebook (Newton Project THEM00002) with scattered entries by Humphrey that
 may begin in 1684 and certainly before 1689 blunts the above argument. Stronger evidence from the text is
 needed.

 finds it being unsurpassed for at least the next 50 years. While he accepts a date around
 1668, Shapiro considers the treatment in the Principia to be simply a reworking of
 De gravitatione. Shapiro argues that the key hydrostatic concepts took shape before

 1672 converging with Newton's work on optics. Gabbey (1971, pp. 1 1, 33, n. 94) in a
 review of seventeenth-century concepts of force and inertia accepts without comment

 a date of about 1669.3 Pride of place, however, is given by most scholars to the long
 metaphysical digression and its discussion of the relationship between God, space,
 body, and motion against the contrary views of Descartes. Stein (1967, pp. 185-186;
 1970, pp. 274-276) considers this treatment to be of the highest order and the analysis

 "deep and trenchant." While considering an early date as plausible, he hints at reasons

 to consider a rather late date. Palter (1987, p. 387) questions the early date in the light

 of the maturity of the metaphysical concepts and how closely they resemble treatments

 in the Principia and later, but accepts a date in the late 1660s or the early 1670s for at
 least some of the ideas.

 On the contrary, Biarnais (1985, p. 182) extols De gravitatione not so much for
 its metaphysics as for its foundational concepts which despite their immaturity pro-
 vide the basis for measurement and experimentation developed much more fully in
 Principia (1687). According to Biarnais (1985, pp. 1 1-13), De gravitatione must be
 dated between 1662 and 1665 because of the close connections found in Newton's

 student notebooks, coupled with the lack of ideas developed in 1666 when Newton
 was able to relate the weight of terrestrial bodies to the force that retains the moon

 in its orbit about the earth.4 A large part of the subsequent analysis (Biarnais, 1985,

 pp. 87-1 81) concerns differences between key definitions in De gravitatione and Prin-
 cipia (1687). Similar ideas are found in Steinle (1991, pp. 124-125) who also favors
 an early date and suggests that a long ripening process of mechanical philosophy was
 required between De gravitatione and documents in 1684, especially in relation to
 the third law of motion, the concept of conatus, and the intension and extension of

 quantities.5

 Despite occasional expressions of doubt or caution, a composition date of 1668-
 1673 was widely accepted, often without comment, until the work of Dobbs in the
 1680s. Dobbs (1982, p. 552, n. 43) argues that Newton's proof in De gravitatione that
 vacuous spaces exist in aether is contrary to the plenist views of his youth and must
 have been dated from the 1680s. Finally, Dobbs (1988; 1991, pp. 139-145) summa-
 rizes the close relations with the Principia noted by other scholars and claims that

 when they are combined with internal empirical evidence (found in the "resistance
 Scholium"), they support a date of late 1 684 or early 1 684/5 just before composing the
 Principia. She finds the handwriting indistinguishable from other documents known

 3 At this stage, Gabbey as well as Dobbs (1991, p. 144) follow Herivel's misreading of indita as insita,
 the significance of which is shown later.

 H While a date before 1 666 might apply to some parts, perhaps in the dehnitions, it cannot be true tor
 the entire text. The digression, before returning to the definitions, ends with a reference to a letter found
 in Descartes (1668). The source of the Descartes reference is mentioned in Whiteside (1970, p. 12) and
 Shapiro (1974, p. 267, n. 70) but stated most clearly in Cohen (1980, pp. 189, 332-333, n. 21).

 5 I owe the reference to Henry (201 1).

 to be written in that period.6 Her argument has acquired considerable traction since
 1991.

 244 J. A. Ruffner

 Cohen (Newton, 1999, 58, 94 passim.) supports Dobbs' analysis and goes on to
 extol Newton's introduction of the term inertia just then on the eve of the Principia
 and not decades earlier, leaving a 15-year gap in its use. This point is reinforced by

 Feingold (2004, pp. 25-26) who thinks that the document originated in 1671 in asso-
 ciation with a previously unknown course of lectures delivered by Newton against
 Descartes' mechanics and Henry More's hydrostatics but took on its present form

 only after the invocation of the term inertia in the mid- 1680s. McGuire (2000, p. 217)
 after a long time accepting a date not later than 1673 also finds Dobbs' claim to be
 persuasive and proceeds to strengthen it by illustrating an unbroken development of
 Newton's theological world system from the first rough drafts of Theologiae gentilis

 origines philosophicae (Philosophical origins of gentile theology) in the early 1683/47
 on through De gravitatione, Principia (1687), documents in the 1690s including abor-
 tive attempts to prepare a revised edition, and the General Scholium of the second
 edition as realized in 1713. A process that stretched over 30 years, however, could just

 as well have begun 15 years earlier.

 The Cambridge Companion to Newton includes a matter-of-fact acceptance by

 Gabbey (2002, p. 33 1 ) of a date in the mid- 1 680s shortly before the Principia , revising
 his position above.8 In a companion essay Stein (2002, pp. 302-303, n. 39) continues
 to express well-founded caution. He thinks that the evidence for an early date is plau-
 sible but inconclusive and decides that after all evidence based on handwriting may
 be conclusive. Hall (2002, pp. 409, 417) cautions the use of handwriting. Acknowl-
 edging that we do not know when it was composed, Hall offers continued support for

 a date before 1672. The Newton Project accepts, without comment, a date of the mid-

 1680s.9 More recently, Henry (201 1, pp. 25-26) finds Dobbs' date to be in the winter

 of 1684/5 after the first set of De motu documents virtually turned to be untenable
 because ideas developed around 1679 are missing, while ideas outmoded by then are
 included. Henry favors the original date of about 1668 given by the Halls. Somewhat

 similar ideas are advanced by Kollerstrom (1999) who also finds Newton's concept of
 gravitas in the document to be incompatible with any date after the mid- 1670s.

 This study adds strong proof that De gravitatione was composed before Halley's
 visit in August 1684 and was not part of the process in the winter of 1684/5 leading

 to the Principia . Less robust considerations rule out any date in 1684. The slim possi-
 bility for a date around winter of 1683/4 is not necessarily ruled out. This conclusion

 follows the same path adopted by Dobbs and Henry, but calls for a different reading

 6 The script in De gravitatione is slightly tighter than in documents known to be from the 1680s but vari-

 ation in quill points, pace of writing, and other factors make it a close call. Similar concerns about dating
 by handwriting are raised by McGuire and Tamny (1983, p. 8) and Hall (2002).

 8 In a forthcoming paper on Newton and materia, , Gabbey chooses the secure ground of a date of 1668
 or later based on Newton's reference to a "letter 96" from Descartes to Mersenne originally found under
 that designation only in Descartes (1668).

 9 Rob Iliffe (2007, p. 64), director of the Newton project, offers a date to be in the late 1670s or more likely
 the early 1680s but cites no particular evidence.

 of the "resistance Scholium," a proper accounting of the "new" pendulum experiment,
 Newton's definition of gravitas , and his use of the concepts of inertia and quantity
 of material.

 2 Dating the empirical content

 The fate of a late date hinges on how well the definitions and empirical claims in De

 gravitatione advance or conflict with comparable material in the series of documents

 under the general title of De motu - On motion). These documents date from Novem-
 ber 1684 and stem from a meeting with Halley's meeting with Newton at Cambridge

 in August 1684. Dobbs argues De gravitatione follows the "new" pendulum experi-
 ment and belongs precisely to a brief period between two specific documents around

 January 1684/5.

 The story is well known (Westfall, 1980, pp. 402-406). Hooke for some time had

 claimed that he was able to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion by supposing an
 attraction to the sun followed an inverse-square relation but could not or would not

 produce adequate proof. Despite an inducement in January with a significant prize and

 subsequent fame, he still meant to keep it secret until others had tried and failed. When
 Halley put the same question to Newton seven months later, Newton is said to have
 responded immediately that the orbit would be an ellipse as he had found subsequent
 to his correspondence with Hooke during 1679/80. Not finding the proof among his

 papers, Newton promised to renew it and send it to Halley.

 On the contrary, Kollerstrom (1999, p. 332) accepts the contention of Lohne (1960,

 p. 35) that Newton developed the orbital proofs from scratch in 1684. Kollerstrom
 (p. 345) suggests "the problem of elliptical orbits caught Newton's interest once he
 realized that a comet trajectory could have this form." He also suggests (p. 354) "the
 truth of the theory of gravity ... may have dawned silently as [Newton] pondered
 over the path of "Halley's comet" of 1682 .... The parabola of its trajectory passed
 close to the ecliptic, but in the reverse direction to the planetary orbits." 10 This "new
 testimony of the heavens" negated the idea of aether resistance and led Newton to
 abandon the vortex theory of gravitation, thereby tacitly eliminating a late date for De
 gravitatione. Kollerstrom (p. 333) dates De gravitatione to be around 1668 because
 a "rather Aristotelian downward impulsion is compared with the conatus recedendi a
 centro of the (Cartesian) solar vortex." This last point is treated in Sect. 6.

 Newton made four relatively crude observations of the comet of 1682 (Correspon-

 dence, 2, pp. 380-381). The apparent motion of the comet was direct according to the
 order of the zodiacal signs and the motion of planets. Some analysis was needed to
 determine the true motion. There is no record to show that Newton reduced his obser-

 vations to standard coordinates, let alone determined a retrograde parabolic path. The

 task was left to Halley working with Flamsteed's observations (Ruffner 2010, p. 445;
 Newton 1999, pp. 934-935). Nevertheless, Newton might have realized quite early that

 10 Kollerstrom notes that the parameters of its orbit were radically different from the comet of 1680 (as

 if Newton had any notion of these parameters in 1684, those cited by Kollerstrom were determined much
 later by Newton or Halley).

 the motion was actually retrograde. Approximate positions noted on a celestial globe

 (with allowance for precession) if transferred to a Copernican plot would have revealed

 the motion among the planets to have been retrograde under almost any hypothesis.11

 Better observations were not available to Newton until 1685. In any case, the comet

 of 1682 was not the first retrograde comet known to him. Newton's work in 1680/1

 revealed the comet of 1664 to be retrograde and Newton knew of other examples from
 sources such as Hevelius (1668). The realization that such motion had implications
 for the properties of space and a theory of gravity, of course, might have occurred to

 Newton only after the appearances of 1682, as a trigger. Yet, Kollerstrom, claiming to

 adhere to the historical record, cites no documents in support. There are documents

 that suggest another course of development in which comets played a significant role.

 Comets very likely were a matter of discussion at the August meeting.12 The issue

 of comets had been revived earlier in 1684 as Newton pondered over the degradation

 of knowledge in antiquity when working on early drafts of "Philosophical Origins."13

 Among the lost ancient truths that needed to be demonstrated anew were the principles
 of planetary motion and the ancient concept that comets are a kind of planet which

 require the heavens to be fluid, and that more generally celestial motions take place in
 "very free spaces" ( spatijs liberrimis) Ruffner (2010, pp. 27-28). The heavens were

 certainly free of solid spheres, but beyond that discovery further proof was needed.

 Nothing was heard for about four months until November when Edward Paget

 delivered a nine-page tract to Halley with the title De motu corporum in gyrum. A

 transcription and translation of the original copy retained at Cambridge is available
 in Newton (1965b) and (Math. Papers, 6, pp. 30-70). The copy delivered to Halley
 is lost, although it provided the basis for the copy deposited at the Royal Society
 (Ball 1893, pp. 35-51). The requested proof is in inverted form showing the inverse-
 square relationship can be derived from an ellipse using a series of definitions and

 hypotheses, then generalized to other conics to eliminate other possibilities. Restoring

 the proof had not been easy, involving false starts and some difficulty in casting the

 definitions and hypotheses from which the proof followed. Such details may support

 Kollerstrom's thesis about the origins of the Kepler-motion proofs but not the trigger-

 1 1 Newton's study of comets during 1680/1 included work using celestial globes (CUL Ms Add. 4004: f.
 lOlr.) Later, in the late summer or the early fall in 1685, Newton devised a method to demonstrate that the
 time between the estimated date the comet of 1 680 entered the earth's orbit to the estimated date of its exits

 was consistent with a parabolic orbit that passed very close to the Sun (Math. Papers, 6; pp. 481-487). This
 account by Whiteside omits the cruder (and seriously flawed) method that Newton applied to four other
 comets, using coordinates obtained from Hevelius and others (Newton, 1960, pp. 618-619). Three of these
 comets, including the comet of 1682, were retrograde. Newton made no comment on this fact, although by
 then, a retrograde orbit was no longer an issue.

 12 A note added to Newton's compilation of data for the comet of 1680 includes information given to him
 by Halley about an observation on December 8, 1680 while traveling to Paris. CUL Ms. Add. 4004, f. lOlr.
 Additional information is squeezed in at f. 99r. Newton had wanted this information in April 1681 and
 likely took the first opportunity to press Halley for details. See Correspondence , 2, p. 361. The note also
 includes an unrelated item on Jean Richer's pendulum experiments at Cayenne, which reveal an interest in
 gravitation. There is no evidence for a prior meeting in 1682 as Westfall and others suppose.

 ing role of the comet of 1682. 14 Newton's proofs specifically invoke zero resistance

 as an assumption. Still assuming zero resistance Newton outlines a method to deter-

 mine whether a comet returns again and again in the same orbit thereby resolving an

 age old question freshly revived in the Philosophical Origins documents. The final
 section, added as an afterthought, treats bodies moved by their vis insita or inherent

 force alone or in conjunction with the force of gravitas through a uniformly resisting

 medium which would also include an all-pervasive aether.15 Resistance is to be deter-

 mined experimentally using small spheres and scaled up by assuming (in a medium of

 the same density) it is proportional jointly to speed and the surface area of the sphere.
 Unlike De gravitatione , the proposed determination continues the assumption the
 resistance of aether is zero because no allowance is made for the additional resistance

 due to the vastly increased surface area as it passes through the internal pore spaces.

 The subsequent version adds the necessary proof.

 An augmented version De motu sphaericorum corporum in fluidis (Newton, 1962e,

 Math Papers, 6, pp. 74-8 1 , excerpts) provides sections on orbital perturbations and

 proof that the resistance of celestial aether is nil or too small to be detected based on
 comets, both direct and retrograde, and the age-long constancy of planetary orbital

 periods. There is no mention of any specific retrograde comet. The text, predomi-
 nately in the hand of his amanuensis, has insertions in Newton's hand, which include

 changing the term hypothesis to law. This version can be dated around December 1684
 (Westfall 1971a, pp. 195-196, n. 21).

 There is another evidence that comets were under active consideration in fall 1684

 alongside the work on planetary orbits. Newton had not completed the task of extract-

 ing data from his micrometer measurements needed to reduce his observations made

 in February and March 1680/1. 16 Half way through the process, Newton discovered
 inconsistencies and turned to Flamsteed for the coordinates of the basic reference stars

 in the first of two requests delivered in mid-December via Paget. Newton's second

 request sought data related to Kepler's laws, the satellites of Saturn, and the problem

 of perturbations.17 Both topics were central to Newton's work off and on for many
 months.

 A manuscript from about January 1684/5, De motu corporum in medijs regulariter
 cedentibus (On the motion of bodies in uniformly yielding media), offers definitions

 of absolute time and absolute space and further laws of motion (Newton 1965c; cor-

 rected in Math Papers, 6, pp. 1 88-193, Latin only).18 None of the De motu documents

 14 Kollerstrom (1999, p. 345) following Iliffe (1994, pp. 68-95) notes Newton was deeply immersed in
 discussions with Henry More about the Apocalypse and Catholic idolatry beginning about January 1679/80.
 Kollerstrom suggests the complexity of the orbital problem would have precluded the solution in the period

 during which Newton also never strayed far from alchemical studies and his "Chymical furnace."

 15 Gravitas is restricted to the terrestrial realm and by the inverse square rule to the moon. This stylistic

 move avoided unnecessary controversy over the causal mechanism of celestial motions; a move not found
 in De gravitatione.

 16 An arcane process to be detailed in another study was used to convert the readings into useable data.

 17 Correspondence, 2, pp. 403-415. Flamsteed's reply is dated 27 December 1684 with exchanges taking
 place up to 27 January 1684/5.

 18 Necessary corrections were indicated by Cohen (1971, pp. 92-96) in which he refers to De motu cor-
 porum in medijs regulariter cedentibus (Newton 1965c) as De motu corporum. Cohen refers to document
 with the actual title of De motu corporum (Newton (1962d)) as De motu corporum: definitions.

 so far use the term inertia. According to Dobbs (1991, pp. 138-141), Newton found

 a narrow window at this point to draft De gravitatione which allegedly introduces the

 term inertia , rejects the corporeal nature of aether utterly and completely and elim-
 inates it as a mechanical cause of gravity. The newly invoked term carries over to
 subsequent manuscripts starting with De motu corporum (On the motion of bodies)

 (Newton 1962d; Wilson 1969, pp. 250-258; Math Papers, 6, pp. 92-97).19 This short
 series of definitions is part of the increasingly expanded manuscripts in the winter of
 1684/5 related to the Principia (Cohen 1971, pp. 82-92, 310-321). A closer look is
 needed.

 3 De gravitatione 's telltale numbers

 The purpose of the digression in De gravitatione is to dispose of Descartes' fictions
 about space and motion expressed in his Principia Philosophiae and Epistolae. 20
 It includes a lengthy telltale argument on the nature of body intended to demonstrate,
 in accordance with Descartes' first law of nature, that the essence is not extension

 alone as claimed but includes capacities to resist change of state and stimulate per-
 ceptions. Newton's argument culminates with the "resistance Scholium" in which he

 adduces proof that aether is a corporeal fluid with those fundamental capacities but
 which must contain large vacuous spaces because of its small yet detectable ability
 to offer resistance. The focus is on actual scattered corpuscles of aether rather than a
 simplified ideal continuous fluid discussed later in the document.

 I will pick up the argument in Newton's section on "space" as distinct from "body."
 For some reason, Newton has stopped making reference to the particular Cartesian
 articles which are clearly implied. Newton argues, "...in space there is no force of

 hence projectiles describe straight lines with a uniform motion unless they meet with

 an impediment from some other source" (Newton 1962b, p. 137; 2004, p. 26).21 This

 point is a gloss on Principia Philosophiae (Principles), Part 2, article 37 containing
 Descartes' first law of nature that each and every thing, in so far as it can, always
 remains in the same state except as the result of external causes, (article 38) the

 19 Further evidence of Newton's deep involvement with comets in late 1684 and early 1685 is found on
 the other half of this document (CUL Ms. Add. 3965.5, f. 21). A much emended final draft of part of Defi-
 nition 3 and an unnumbered but clean final draft of Definition 4 seem to be squeezed in below an unused

 heading for star longitudes and latitudes where presumably empty space had been left earlier for listing
 data. Immediately below the revisions of the definitions and scattered around the edges are calculations to
 determine the position of the sun using Flamsteed's solar theory for the times the comet of 1680 had been
 observed at Canterbury by Thomas Hill and at Rome by Pontheo. There is no evidence Newton had access

 to Pontheo's data in 1681 when he was using Wing's solar theory, as will be shown in a forthcoming paper.
 Cohen (1971, pp. 92-93) omits notice of this solar data.

 Newton would have used Renati Descartes Principia Philosophiae (Amsterdam, 1656) and Renati
 Descartes, Epistolae (London, or Amsterdam, 1668). I briefly consulted the London imprint along with
 Descartes (1985-1991) , Miller and Miller (1991) and Graukroger (2002).

 confirmation of this first law by the everyday experience of projectiles, and (article
 39) Descartes' second law of nature that all motion is in itself rectilinear. Newton's

 argument continues with a critique of Descartes' contention that the nature of body

 is simply extension and not its being something which is hard, heavy, or colored, or

 which affects the senses in any way (Principles, Part 2, article 2). Bodies are defined, in

 so far as possible, as determined quantities of extension endowed by omnipresent God

 with certain conditions, namely, mobility; impenetrability, and the ability to arouse

 mental perceptions (Newton 1962b, p. 140; 2004, p. 28). Bodies must be impenetrable

 lest two occupy the same place at the same time. As such they obstruct each other's
 motion and are reflected, most notably, according to certain laws which tacitly include

 the first law of nature and the endeavor to resist change of state that Newton began to
 articulate in the mid- 1660s.

 In essence, Newton's view depicts a "billiard ball" physics in which inert bodies

 have been endowed only with a principle of perseverance and act only through laws of

 impact and reflection. Henry (201 1, 23-24) notes there is no hint of active principles

 (other than "inertial" endeavor) or inter-particulate forces of attraction and repulsion

 that begin to appear in writings after around 1670 and that the sparseness of properties

 suggest an earlier date. The date is ambiguous. Newton declares at the beginning of the

 essay that he will postulate only the properties required for local motion. Whenever
 written, Newton's argument can be seen as narrowly constructed simply to refute

 Descartes' proposition. Moreover, whatever may be true at the micro-level is not nec-

 essarily true at the macro-level. Consider magnetic forces of attraction and repulsion
 which are not essential for all kinds of bodies. The important point is a body has the

 essential ability to arouse mental perceptions. You cannot have one without the other.

 Newton argues whatever reality that we attribute to bodies arises from their phenom-
 ena and sensible qualities. Removing the ability from bodies would also remove the
 other endowed ability to resist change of state and transfer mutual actions from one

 to another, thereby absurdly reducing body to empty space (Newton, 1962b, p. 146).
 The task is to use the testimony of the phenomena to demonstrate the contradiction
 in Descartes' argument since there is no difference between the extension of space
 and the extension of a body, and therefore, empty spaces cannot exist between bodies

 (Principles, Part 2, article 16, etc.).

 For this demonstration, Newton reverses his earlier gloss. Invoking an oft-repeated

 principle he argues, since resistance to motion decreases from mercury to water to air
 to aether, to further eliminate all such resistance would utterly eliminate the corporeal

 nature of the medium by which actions are transferred from one to another. Therefore,

 ... if there were any aerial or aetherial space of such a kind that it yielded without

 any resistance to the motion of comets or any other projectiles, I should believe
 that it was utterly empty. For it is impossible that a corporeal fluid should not
 impede the motion of bodies passing through it, assuming that (as I supposed
 before) it is not disposed to move at the same speed as [them] (Part II, Epistle
 96 to Mersenne) (Newton 1962b, p. 146; 2004, p. 34).22

 Notice that planets are not mentioned as test probes. It is Newton's concept follow-

 ing the contention of Descartes, Wing, and others that they are carried by the solar
 vortex. The idea is adapted for a theory of lunar motion in a note added (c. 1669)
 to the end papers of Newton's copy of Wing's Astronomia Britannica (Whiteside
 1964, pp. 124-127). Newton (1962b, p. 124; 2004, p. 15) also uses the idea "as sup-
 posed before" when countering Descartes' absurd notion about philosophical motion.

 The absurdity is posed against their common belief that the planets ride in a vortex.

 As such there is no reason to invoke the age long stability of the planetary periods
 which the force of aether would otherwise erode.23 Palter (1987, pp. 410-411) con-
 tends the references to vortices have only a rhetorical role in the reductio arguments

 and do not commit Newton to a belief in their reality. The test is what Newton meant
 by the phrase "as I supposed before" and the conatus of aether "gyrating about the
 sun" in his subsequent definition of gravitas.

 The notion that comets, like other projectiles, cut through their fluid surroundings

 is contrary to Descartes' claim cited earlier in the document that comets (come to) ride

 at rest with the solar vortex near its outer edge (p. 127). 24 Given the formulation of

 the argument it is puzzling no evidence is provided about the effect, if any, that aether

 has on comets, being content a little further on to offer evidence based on terrestrial

 phenomena. The retardation of projectiles by air infused with aether would have been

 obvious and needed no further exposition. Was the same true of comets hurling through

 pure aether? Or did Newton omit celestial evidence based on the phenomena of com-
 ets because he lacked a clear demonstration and deferred to better established or less

 contentious evidence? In any case, since De motu corporum in fluidis addresses the
 problem directly for both comets and planets, De gravitatione must have been written
 earlier.

 Throughout the 1660s and 1670s, Newton most likely adhered to the view offered

 by Streete (1661, p. 15) that comets travel among the planetary orbits but unlike plan-
 ets they are "incompact and dissolvable" and "their motions are (as Kepler defines
 them) in or near to right lines." Newton obtained a few observations in 1664 and 1665

 but made no known attempt to determine an actual trajectory. If De gravitatione was

 drafted in this period, then the idea could be seen as a prospective test, in which case
 Newton would have deferred to the best available terrestrial evidence, as here.

 Newton's initial work on the comet of 1680 was framed by what might be called
 Platonic archetypes of straight lines and their great circle equivalents on the celes-

 tial sphere. For his part Newton found difficulty with every suggestion from Flams-

 teed that the sun attracted or influenced the motion of the comet in some other way.

 Footnote 22 continued

 corporeum non obstet motibus trajectorum, puta si non disponitur ad motum juxta cum eorurn motu velocem
 (Part 2 Epist 96 ad Mersennum) (Newton 1962b, pp. 1 12-113). The translation has modified slightly in
 the forthcoming paper by Gabbey. See note 8. A translation of the original Mersenne letter is in Descartes
 (1985-1991), 3, pp. 131-133, To Mersenne, 9 January 1639.

 23 Westfall (1971b, p. 350) notes that Newton realized quite early that stability, albeit in a circular orbit,
 requires the interactions to be perfectly elastic.

 24 It is noteworthy that Newton's interest in comets had anti-Cartesian twist since his student days and that

 at least twice, in 1 680/1 and 1 685, he gathered evidence of the kind long available by naked eye observation
 that proved Descartes to be wrong. See Ruffner (2010, pp. 426, 432-433).

 Newton's De gravitatione 25 1

 The famous outline of such a mechanism by which the comet turned about the sun with
 an imbalance between a continuous solar attraction and the comet's vis centrifuga was

 drafted so that Flamsteed could build a plausible theory. The suggestion was aban-
 doned because Newton's own work showed it to be false. A significant part of Newton's

 evidence stemmed from a determination of the comet's ascending node based on the

 idea the apparent path of a comet follows a great circle arc in its initial appearances

 with later departures due to the perspectives of the earth's annual motion.25 Newton's

 solution of the actual path was based on uniform rectilinear motion with only slight

 curvature in the vicinity of the sun. Such a finding was compatible with his view at the

 time that the vortex could deflect the passage of bodies cutting across it. The finding,

 however, was inconsistent in failing to allow for resistance to forward motion except

 perhaps in the backward bending of the tail, where the effect of resistance would be
 most evident.26 The failure to cite this evidence for the existence of a corporeal aether

 may be taken as an indication that De gravitatione was not composed between 1680
 and 1 683, or until he began to doubt his views on comets held in those years, especially

 with regard to resistance.

 As noted above, around the beginning of 1 684 Newton began to entertain the ancient

 idea that comets are a kind of planet traveling in highly eccentric orbits in "very free

 spaces." Tycho's comet observations had already proven the heavens to be free of
 solid spheres. What needed to be proven anew was that comets were a kind of planet
 and the heavens were free of resistance. If Newton wrote De gravitatione after the

 Philosophical Origins document of winter 1683/4 and was uncertain or lacked proper
 demonstrations, once again he might defer to terrestrial evidence. It is not clear, how-
 ever, that Newton would have linked comets with projectiles in this period. Depending
 on how one reads the evidence cited, this section of De gravitatione might be dated

 before 1 680 or between the winters of 1 683 and 1 684 and the composition of De motu

 corporum in fluidis where the first proof is offered.

 Newton continues the argument by noting Descartes' logical error in begging the

 question when he asserts the force of resistance to the passage of bodies can be removed

 from space without having first proved that space and body do not differ. Then to
 remove any doubt, Newton cites the best possible terrestrial evidence that there are

 empty spaces in the natural world proving that body is not simply extension. He posits

 another oft-repeated principle that ordinary fluids impact only the external surfaces of

 ordinary (porous) bodies while aether flows through all their pores spaces drastically

 increasing the exposed surface area and the resistance of each aetherial particle. These

 particles must be relatively far apart in relation to their diameter with large empty
 spaces at the micro level. Otherwise, aether would yield to bodies passing through it
 with much greater inertia and offer more resistance than the particles of an ordinary

 fluid which do not penetrate the interior parts. Finally, a quantitative estimate follows
 that indicates a considerable degree of resistance:

 25 Two observations fix the position the node by calculation or by extrapolation along their apparent great
 circle arc with the aid of a globe. Newton did not realize or chose to ignore the variation that results from
 the choice of dates. This variation was demonstrated by Flamsteed at the very same time (Forbes 1975,

 pp. 28, 109).

 ^ These ideas are touched lightly in Ruffner (2010, pp. 426-427), a more detailed study is in progress.

 Since the resistance of the aether is on the contrary so small when compared with

 the resistance of quicksilver as to be over ten or a hundred thousand times less,

 there is all the more reason for thinking that by far the largest part of the aetherial

 space is empty, scattered between the aetherial particles (Newton 1962b, p. 147;
 2004, p. 35).27

 Putting the claim in context, experiments by Boyle (1662, pp. 148-155) and Hooke

 (1665, p. 27) indicate that the density of air at the surface (and hence its resistance
 which is assumed to be proportional to density) is about 1/13,000 or 1/14,000 that
 of quicksilver. Thus, with a density of aether somewhat over 10,000 times less than
 quicksilver its resistance would be of the same order of magnitude as air at the sur-
 face. This result is consistent with the "old" pendulum experiment of Boyle (1662, pp.

 103-105) that found little difference between the duration in air assumed to be infused

 with aether and an evacuated glass sphere presumably filled only with aether.28 Even

 a density ratio of 1/100,000 would yield resistance comparable to air only a few miles

 above the surface of the earth based on the decrease of air pressure with altitude.29 Did

 Newton attempt to quantify the results of Boyle and Hooke, make a mistake in some
 experimental setup of his own, or (especially in the case of 1/100,000) rhetorically
 toss off numbers intended to evoke an image of trivial resistance? Newton provides
 no idea, here or indeed in the Principia , of how the density of aether may vary with

 distance from a central body.30 The passage proves only that there is no plenum and

 that widely scattered aether corpuscles exert detectable resistance. Space per se may

 be completely free of resistance but not the fluid mediums in it.

 This outcome can be compared with the results of Newton's "new" pendulum exper-

 iment which Dobbs claims was accomplished before De gravitatione. As reported
 (from memory) in the Principia (1667, p. 353; 1999, pp. 722-723), the resistance
 of pure aether is over 5,000 times smaller than the combined resistance of air and
 aether. This result makes the resistance more than 60-70,000,000 times smaller than

 quicksilver, a value much less than reported here and one that at last truly supports a

 conclusion that the resistance of aether is either nil or imperceptible. Manifestly that

 pendulum experiment is not the basis of the result in De gravitatione as commonly
 assumed.

 In further support of his contention that aether is composed of scattered particles of
 corporeal matter and hence capable of some degree of resistance Newton's argument

 27 Sed cum aetheris e contra tarn parva est resistentia ut ad resisentiam argenti vivi collata videatur esse
 plusquam decies vel centies mille vicibus minor: sane spatij aetherei pars longe maxima pro vacuo inter
 aetherea corpuscula disseminato haberi debet (Newton 1962b, p. 113).

 28 Newton refers to this experiment in De aere et aethere (Newton 1962c, pp. 220, 227-228).

 29 See for example Hooke ( 1 665, pp. 227-228). Hooke did not sum the result of the problem set up divided
 into 1000 layers. With or without the actual result Newton would have realized the lower density would be
 found not far above the earth's surface.

 30 By way of contrast, as an afterthought in his letter to Boyle, dated 28 February 1678/9, Newton conjec-

 tures that the particles of aether vary in a continuum from fine to gross and that terrestrial gravitation results
 from aether in which the gross proportion increases with distance about the earth's surface. He offers no

 speculation about celestial aether. Correspondence , ii: 295. And in Query 21 (originally 1717) the density
 of aether, as a cause of gravity, grows perpetual denser with distance from the bodies of the sun, stars,
 planets, and comets (Newton 1952, p. 350).

 continues with a passage that uses the term "quantity of matter" rather than earlier

 terms such as "the bulk of body" or simply "body" (see Sect. 5):

 The same may also be conjectured from the various gravities of these fluids, for

 the descent of heavy bodies and the oscillations of pendulums show that these

 are in proportion to their densities, or as the quantities of matter contained in
 equal spaces. But this is not the place to go into this (Newton 1962b, p. 147;
 2004, p. 35).31

 Again these notions about bodies falling in various fluids are not based on experi-

 ments reported in the Principia (1999, pp. 758-761). Those experiments are restricted
 to air and water mediums and postdate the first edition.32 It is more likely Newton
 had heard about the experiments with falling bodies fostered by the Royal Society
 in the 1660 (Gunther 1967-1968, 1, p. 248). This information could possibly have
 been obtained from John Collins in November 1669 during a trip to London, if not

 before.33 Be that as it may, implicit recognition of the principle is found in a tract
 of about 1666 on the laws of motion (Newton 1962a, p. 163). Newton notes that the
 motions of ordinary aggregate bodies are continually impeded by the mediums in
 which they move, implying the resistance increases as the density of the aggregated

 parts increases. It is also possible he freely extrapolated from items such as Descartes'
 account of projectile motion, in which the resistance in any other fluid is even more
 obvious than in the case of air (Principles, Part 2, article 38). Similar recognition
 also underlies the treatment of violent motion in one of Newton's student notebooks

 (McGuire and Tamny 1983, pp. 406-409).

 Newton's pendulum experiments using boxes filled with equal weights of diverse

 materials such as water, sand, lead, and gold do not seem to be at issue here.34 The

 reference to pendulum experiments in different fluid mediums is more difficult to pin
 down. The Principia reports experiments of pendulums oscillating in water and air

 indicating resistances on the order of 800 or 900 (later 850) to 1, or nearly in propor-

 tion to their densities. In quicksilver and water the results are on the order of 13 or 14
 to 1, again in proportion to their densities ( Principia , 1687, pp. 347-350; 1999, pp.
 719-21). Aether is not an issue, however, and again information about experiments

 ordered by the Royal Society in the 1660s may have been the source. Greater attention

 to the sources of the empirical assertions in De gravitatione is needed.

 Newton's corresponding argument in De motu corporum in fluidis is also based

 on the regression of resistance from mercury to water to air and the great increase in
 surface area with which aether collides. The much stronger claim is that the aether

 31 Quod idem praeterea ex diversa gravitate horum fluidorum conjicere liceat, quam esse ut eorum den-
 sitates sive ut quantitates materiae in aequalibus spatijs contentae monstrat turn gravium turn descensus
 undulationes pendulorum. Sed his enucleandis jam non est locus (Newton 1962b, p. 113). Note what is
 evidently the first use of " quantitates materiae " rather than simply "bulk" or "body."

 32 For an extended discussion see Smith (2000, pp. 105-136).

 33 There is no detailed account of what was discussed. See Correspondence, 1, pp. 53-54.

 34 These experiments were first mentioned in De motu corporum in medijs regulariter cendentibus (circa
 January 1684/5) and were restricted to oscillations in air. See Herivel (1965, pp. 316-317, 319) and Wilson
 (1969, pp. 162-164). See also Sect. 5 below.

 flows freely over all the individual parts yet offers no detectable resistance which
 is either non-existent or extremely meager. Proof includes the observation that the

 tails and comas (or atmospheres) of comets are not torn off despite being carried at
 immense speed in all directions through the heavens. Additional proof is the con-
 stancy of the mean periods of the planets over thousands of years (Newton 1962b,
 pp. 285-286). There is no mention of the "new" pendulum experiment that proves the
 same point. As Cohen (1980, p. 314) notes, if the experiment was conducted before
 drafting De motu corporum influidis he would have mentioned it. Indeed, it is possible

 the experiment was conducted later in winter 1684/5 looking for direct confirmation.
 It is almost beyond belief that De gravitatione was composed after these first two
 De motu tracts unless it incorporates old notes he carelessly neglected to bring up to
 date.

 The treatment of aether in De gravitatione manifestly does not remove its corpo-

 real nature utterly and completely. Dobbs misses the point while Henry (201 1, p. 25)

 grasps it without realizing the significance of the numbers. The small but detectable
 and hence quantifiable resistance of "pure" aether is the culmination of his evidence

 against the Cartesian principle that the nature of body consists not in weight, hardness,

 color, or the like, but simply in extension. The Cartesian argument is unsound because

 no vortices or other parts of a system of the world can be fashioned from extension

 without also invoking the corporeal nature of God's "determined quantities" and their

 inherent laws of impact, reflection, and perseverance (Newton 1965b, pp. 147-148).

 4 Definitions and the questions of inertia and gravitas

 Returning to the main theme of gravitation or heaviness and equilibrium of fluids and
 of solids in fluids, De gravitatione continues the series of definitions interrupted by
 the digression and finishes inconclusively with the elements of fluid science. First I
 will take a close look at the definitions and various translations of vis , inertia , and

 gravitas including the use of indita here and elsewhere in the text.

 Definition 5. Force is the causal principle of motion and rest. And it is either an

 external one that generates or destroys or otherwise changes impressed motion
 in some body; or it is an internal principle by which existing motion or rest is

 conserved in a body, and by which any being endeavours to continue in its state
 and opposes resistance (Newton 1962b; 2004, p. 36).35

 The German translation (Newton 1988, p. 77) similarly indicates the state of motion

 or rest is something a body has (die ein Körper hat). These translations do not properly

 account for the Latin "indita" A better translation of the phrase quo motus vel quies
 corpori indita conservatur would be "by which the motion or rest imparted to a body

 is conserved." This rendering is supported by the French translation which reads "par

 35 Vis est motus et quietis causale principium. Estque vel externum quod in aliquod corpus impressum

 motum ejus vel gene rat vel destruit, vel aliquo saltern modo mutât , vel est internum principium quo motus vel

 quies corpori indita conservatur, et quodlibet ens in suo statu perseverare conatur & impeditum reluctatur
 (Newton 1962b, p. 114).

 Newton's De gravitatione 255

 lequel le movement ou le repose attaché au corps est conservé." The significance of

 " indita " as something imparted or attached to a body is developed below.

 Definition 7. Inertia is the inner force of a body, lest its state should be easily

 changed by an external exciting force, ibid?6

 These ideas are distilled from Descartes (Principles, Part 2, articles 37-44) and

 sketched in Newton's early dynamical writings in the Waste Book which date from
 about 1664 or 1665. Force as a cause of change stems from Axiom 3 (Herivel 1965,
 p. 141), "There is exactly required so much and noe more force to reduce a body
 to rest as there was to put it upon motion :et e contra The concept of force as an

 internal principle stems from Axiom 100 (p. 153) which states in part, "Every thing

 doth naturally perseveres in that state in which it is unless it bee interrupted by some
 external cause." As for the new definition, can Newton be saying the inner principle

 adjusts its endeavor to oppose resistance and conserve a body's the state of motion in
 accordance with whatever change is imparted?

 The term inertia is not found in the Waste Book entries. Cohen (Newton 1999,

 pp. 100-101) thinks its invocation here as an active principle, allegedly on the eve of

 the Principia , is intended as an anti-Cartesian move contrary to usage in the correspon-
 dence between Descartes and Mersenne.37 Newton, however, had many anti-Cartesian

 moments and its adoption could have occurred any time after the publication of the

 Latin edition of letters in 1668. By any account of the date, early or late, the definition

 of inertia provides the first known use of the term for the concept of perseverance.

 Cohen (Newton 1999, p. 58) also believes Newton equated this inner or inher-
 ent perseverance principle with vis indita. That is doubtful. Newton makes several
 others uses of the verb indere which nearly all the various translations render as
 something imparted or applied to the object. Newton (1962b, p. 96) mentions a
 "Ws caelis indita in which " indita " is rendered variously as "impressed" (New-
 ton 1962b, p. 128), "imparted" (Newton 2004, p. 18), "appliquée" (Newton 1985,
 p. 28), and "eingeprägte" (Newton 1988, p. 27). In another passage, Newton (1962b,

 p. 100), the phrase " color si inditus esset" is rendered similarly as "if color were intro-
 duced" (Newton 1962b, p. 133; 2004, p. 23); "la couleur introduite" (Newton 1985,

 p. 38); "die Farbe beigibt" (Newton 1988, p. 41). In another instance, Newton (1962b,
 pp. 107, 140; 2004, p. 29) refers to a body's "impressed form" (inditam formant).
 In a departure from the idea of something that has been added, Newton (1985, p. 52)
 renders the phrase "la forme qui lui est inherente ." However, Newton (1988, p. 58),
 in basic agreement with the English translations, renders the phrase "ihr verliehenen
 Form (its conferred form)."

 Finally, and most importantly, there is the definition of gravitas (Newton 1962b,

 p. 114) the first line of which reads, " Gravitas est vis corpori indita ad descendendum
 incitans The English and French translations are in basic agreement: "Gravity is a
 force in a body compelling it to descend" (Newton 1962b, p. 148); "Gravity is a force

 Inertia est vis interna corporis ne status ejus externa vi illata facile mutetur, ibid.

 within a body impelling it to descend" (Newton 2004, p. 36); "La gravité est la force

 qui incite un corps a descendre." (Newton 1985, p. 68). Only Newton (1988, p. 77)
 provides the sense that gravity is provided (damit versehen) to a body: "Schwere ist die
 Kraft, die in der Körper, der damit versehen ist, antriebt herabzufallen." Newton has

 defined two different concepts of force: an external one causing change of state, and

 an internal one actively preserving the status quo and resisting change. Does Newton's

 definition of gravitas provide a different internal force that actively generates motion
 to descend? The concept makes more sense if, as in the German, the gravitational

 force is provided or imparted to a body by an external cause consistent with a variety
 of hypothetical mechanisms, or God's direct action.

 In sum, vis indita is not innate but something has been added to body or put there

 whether by of divine will, mechanical impact, or other action. It is not a term denoting
 the inherent or innate principle of inertia. It is noteworthy, after adopting vis insi-

 ta (inherent force) as the term for the inertial principle the concept is successively
 enhanced, as if a matter of self-correction, to denote a force that is inherent and innate

 (vis insita et innata ) and then one that is inherent, innate and essential (vis insita,
 innata et essentalis).

 Let us assume, however, Cohen correctly identifies inertia with a vis indita in De

 gravitatione. He is concerned that an early date creates a gap of about fifteen year in
 the use of the term. De motu in gyrum , De motu corporum in fluidis , and De motu
 corporum in medijs regulariter cedentibus use the current term vis insita for the innate

 principle and make no mention of inertia. Dobbs' placement of De gravitatione after

 this point allows inertia to appear as the term for the innate principle with an anti-

 Cartesian thrust. Allegedly inertia is first equated with vis insita in the fragmentary De

 motu corporum , followed by drafts of Lucasian lectures and finally Definition 3 in the

 Principia (1687). This sequence leaves no gap in the use of the term but, after already
 using vis insita for the inherent principle, a problem arises if inertia is then equated

 with vis indita in De gravitatione. If so, there is also a problem in that the vis corpori

 indita of gravitas should also be considered an inherent rather than an imparted force

 which drives a body downward. But if, as suggested, vis indita has nothing to do with
 the innate principle, then neither problem arises.

 By itself, the use of inertia in De gravitatione creates no problem for a late intro-

 duction. Setting the composition date after any of the early De motu tracts, however,
 requires an accounting for the quantitative measure of aether resistance and other

 points noted here that have greater empirical significance. Despite the concern over
 the date for the invocation of the term inertia culminating with use in Definition 3,

 Principia (1687), it is noteworthy that the working term throughout the rest of the

 first edition remains the vis insita just as in the early De motu tracts (Cohen 1980, pp.
 315-326; Newton 1999, p. 98, n. 22).

 The early De motu documents address certain questions about the motion of planets

 and comets in specific response to Halley's query for which the current term vis insita

 denoting an innate or natural power would have been appropriate. A gap in the use of

 the term inertia in a novel sense should be of little concern. If a target was intended,
 it would have been Hooke, not Descartes. These documents answer a question that

 Hooke could not solve and were not initially intended as preliminary to a large system-
 atic work devoted to philosophical principles. Moreover, the section on comets is not

 set up to challenge Descartes directly but to resolve an age-old problem. It is not known

 what scale of treatment Newton contemplated in December 1684 and January 1685,
 but he expected to complete it within a few weeks. By late February 1685, Newton was
 lamenting the failure to finish his intended work because the examination of several

 things took more time than expected with much of it to no purpose ( Correspondence ,

 2, p. 415). The failed efforts surely included very demanding but unfinished work on
 perturbation theory and comet orbits. Does De gravitatione fit in as one of the several

 things?

 5 The issue of quantity of matter

 As noted in Sect. 3, De gravitatione makes use of the concept of quantity of matter
 wherein Newton speaks of "densities, or . . . the quantity of matter contained in equal

 spaces." The concept shows up again in De motu corporum , Definition 1 , "the quantity

 of matter is that which arises from its density and bulk conjointly. ... This quantity
 I designate under the name of body or mass" (Newton 1962d, p. 241).38 The usage
 in De motu corporum follows exactly the place Dobbs contends De gravitatione was
 written. Newton makes many early uses of terms such as bulk, body, and density.
 If there were no uses of "quantity of matter" between De gravitatione , given an early

 date, and De motu corporum the problem could be more serious than a gap an early

 date is said to leave in the use of the term inertia. Several possibilities exist.

 De motu corporum in gyrum introduces density as part of Hypothesis 1, "Resistance

 ... is as the speed of the body and the density of the medium conjointly."39 Since it was

 directed at Halley and his circle no further explanation of density may have been need.

 The final Scholium in the text treats the motion of projectiles in air which is assumed

 to be homogenous and gravity acts uniformly in parallel straight lines. The resistance

 of the air is to be determined using a small test ball and scaled to any other desired size

 under the assumption that resistance is proportional jointly to the speed and surface

 area of the sphere. Since only one homogeneous medium is involved, again there is no

 need to consider variation in density or quantity of matter. The more general point is

 stated in Law 5 (originally Hypothesis 5) of the emended version, De motu corporum
 in fluidis , "The resistance of a medium is as the density of the medium and as the
 spherical surface of the moving body and its velocity conjointly."40 Density is not
 further defined. Furthermore, Newton argues "Quicksilver resists strongly, water far

 less, and air still less. These mediums resist according to their density, which is almost

 proportional to their weights and hence (I may almost say) according to the quantity of
 their solid matter." (Newton 1962e, p. 286). 41 The term materiae crassae translated as

 Quantitas materiae est quae oritur ex ipsius densitate et magnitudine conjunctim....Hanc quantitatem

 per nomen corporis vel massae désigna (Newton 1962d, p. 239).

 Resistentiam ... esse ut corporis celeritas et medij densitas conjunctim (Newton 1965b, p. 257).

 u Resistentiam medii esse ut medii illius densitas et corporis moti spherica surperficies et velocitas
 conjunctim (Newton 1962e, p. 243).

 41 Valide resistit argentum vivum, longe minus aqua, aero vero longe adhuc minus. Pro densitate sua quae
 ponderifere proportionalis est atque adeo (poene dixerim) pro quantitate materiae suae crasse resistunt
 haec media {ibid, p. 261).

 "solid matter" might well be thought of in its literal sense as "thick matter" in contrast

 to thin or tenuous aether, the resistance of which by this time Newton has proven to
 be non-existent or extremely small.

 The idea of quantity of matter persists in De motu corporum in medijs regulariter

 cendentibus including some definitions once considered part of De motu corporum
 42 Definition 6 indicates, "The density of a body is the quantity or bulk of matter
 compared with the quantity of space occupied."43 Definition 7 continues the use of
 "quantity or bulk of matter" and goes on to indicate, "when the oscillations of two
 equal pendulums with bodies of the same weight are counted, the bulk of matter in
 both will be reciprocal to the number of oscillations made in the same time [in the

 same medium]."44 This result is said to be confirmed by experiments with a variety of
 materials, such as gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, common salt, water, lead, and wheat.
 If an early date is accepted for De gravitatione , then it cannot be said that New-

 ton totally neglected the idea of quantity of matter before it reappeared in De motu
 corporum , Definition 1.

 6 A further look at gravitas

 The definition of gravitas in my revised translation reads as follows:

 Definition 1 0. Gravity is a force imparted to a body impelling it to descend. Here,

 however, by descent is not only meant a motion towards the center of the earth,

 but also towards any point or region, or even from any point. In this way if the
 conatus of the aether gyrating about the sun to recede from its center be taken

 for gravity, in receding from the sun the aether could be said to descend. And

 so by analogy, that plane should be called horizontal that is directed opposed to
 the direction of gravity or conatus 45

 The rest of the definition indicates that gravitas and other force related concepts

 can be reckoned according either to intension or extension.

 According to Definition 9, pressure is transmitted to the remotest parts of any

 body, whether hard, soft, or fluid, only by contiguous parts acting upon one another
 at a point or surface of contact (Newton 1962b, p. 148; 2004, p. 36). Definition 10
 treats heaviness or gravity in a fluid medium in which, according to the hydrostatic

 principle, pressure acts in any direction so that concepts of up and down have no par-
 ticular significance. The definition has the sense of universality in that the terrestrial

 42 CUL Ms. Add. 3965.5, f. 25 v, see Herivel (1965, pp. 316, 319); Cohen (1971, p. 93).

 Newton's De gravitatione 259

 meaning of gravitas is generalized to gravitas pressing in every direction to and from

 points and regions. In a fluid there is no problem in imagining action from one point

 to another, but what does Newton mean by region? Perhaps he is thinking abstractly
 where a region represents a "determined quantities of extension" such as a planet or
 an individual star. Although Newton is silent on the matter, according to this defini-

 tion, planets that stay in orbits must have a force imparted to them which balances

 the endeavor of aetherial particles gyrating about the sun to recede from its center and

 which also constantly deflects the endeavor of a planet to proceed tangentially in a

 straight line. Whatever the case, gravitas is depicted as a property of gyrating celestial

 matter as well as a property of terrestrial bodies, a further indication that Newton has
 moved on from Descartes' concept but not reduced aether almost to nothingness as
 Dobbs suggests.

 Böhme (Newton 1988, pp. 99-100) thinks the definition of gravitas could be con-

 nected with an intrinsic "gravitation upward," a phrase found in More (1676: Preface:

 f. 1 passim.) when commenting on the idea as found in Hale (1673, pp. 10-1 1). While
 More (Preface: ff. 10-2) finds the term "is not destitute of all good ground," he con-
 siders his view of a "Spirit of Nature" as the agent "far less obnoxious." But the

 underlying mechanics of De gravitatione is connected to laws of impact, reflection,
 and perseverance. Even if Newton considers the force that drives a body downward

 as put there by God it would be by direct action rather than an intermediary.46

 Henry (201 1, p. 24) contrasts the pressure by contact concept in De gravitatione

 with the much richer concept in Newton's tract De aere et aethere (Newton 1962c, pp.
 223-224) which he believes was written around 1679. That document links pressure

 to actions at a distance and the agitation of particles by heat, making it highly probable

 that De gravitatione was written first. A strong point, although one could counter that

 for different purposes Newton might well have chosen ideal models of gases and fluids

 that happen to be incommensurable.

 Less successful is Henry's argument (201 1, p. 24) that Newton's definitions of hard

 and fluid bodies do not invoke concepts of atoms and inter-particulate forces which
 characterize much of the writings of the 1670s. The argument is suggestive but not
 conclusive. These definitions relate to abstract constructs. Newton (1962b, pp. 151-

 152) states clearly the definitions were crafted after the manner of geometers even

 though nothing actually exists that is absolutely or uniformly fluid or solid. Moreover,
 the discussions of fluid resistance in the early De motu documents make no allowance

 for inter-particulate forces.

 Henry (2011, p. 24) goes on to suggest the definition of gravitas is compatible

 with if not actually derived from Descartes' account and is out of keeping with New-
 ton's views developed after the controversy with Hooke in 1679. Kollerstrom (1999,

 p. 333) makes much the same point with further connections to the Trinity notebook.
 Clear roots are found in Descartes' Principles, Part 4, articles 20-27, according to

 which gravity or heaviness is limited to terrestrial bodies. The parts of terrestrial mat-
 ter do not naturally cohere but are pushed together by surrounding celestial matter
 acting equally on all sides. As the gyrating particles of celestial matter recede from

 46 McGuire (1968, p. 156) notes Newton prefers direct action by God over action by a world soul.

 the center they stream around the particles of terrestrial matter, displacing them and
 driving them downward.47 Newton's account slides over the exact mechanism of dis-

 placement making it difficult to connect with ideas expressed at different times. But

 Newton has eliminated the difference between up and down giving new meaning to
 down in a fluid medium. More significantly, Newton has a much more general notion

 than Descartes who finds the cause of gravity in celestial matter but limits the effect
 to terrestrial matter.

 Kollerstrom (1999, pp. 333-337) emphasizes the difference between this account

 of gravitas and passages in Newton's Hypothesis of Light according to which celestial

 matter has a tenacious and gummy nature which may cause not only the descent of ter-

 restrial matter but also may keep the planet from receding further from the sun (Newton

 1958, p. 181). Kollerstrom make a significant point but one which neglects Newton's

 discussion of celestial matter in the early 1680s that do not posit such properties.

 Henry (2011, p. 24) notes the much more explicit treatment De motu corporum

 in gyrum where Newton identifies gravitas as one kind of centripetal force. Its use is

 restricted to uniform gravity acting on projectiles conjoined with progressive horizon-

 tal motion or with an inverse square relation force extending to the moon. References

 to gravitas are deleted in other instances and replaced by terms such as vis centripae

 and vis centripetae circumsolaris. More directly, Newton indicates planets are retained

 in their orbits only by some kind of centripetal force, "whatever it might be." Although
 Newton undoubtedly believed that force to be gravitas , this rhetoric avoids unneces-

 sary controversy. If De gravitatione were written later, then its treatment of gravitas

 that shows only the influence of Descartes would be out of place. Nevertheless, aethe-
 rial mechanisms, rotating celestial matter, and endeavors to recede lurked in Newton's

 mind for a long time.

 Newton may not have totally discarded the notion of a mechanical aether until at

 least mid- 1685. His propositions on comets include rotating celestial matter along
 with a proposition indicating the sun is nearly in the focus of a comet's trajectory, a
 possible reference to perturbation that may post date De motu corporum influidis .48
 Furthermore, an early draft of a portion of De motu corporum liber secundus , Prin-

 cipia' s original book 2, intended as a popular treatise on the "System of the World,"

 still refers to the solar vortex, although perhaps as a dig at Descartes' theory of com-
 ets, only to be replaced in another unused passage by circumsolar force (CUL Ms.
 Add. 3965.11, ff. 175r-176r). Moreover, the endeavor of planets or other bodies to
 recede from the center of their orbits is found in the Principia (1687, p. 8; 1999,
 p. 41 1) and in an augmented discussion of centripetal force first inserted much later in

 Newton's interleaved copy of the first edition (Newton 1972, 1, p. 42; Principia 1999,
 p. 405). And when confronted with certain problems such as the ascent of comet tails

 he invoked an explanation involving celestial aetherial matter that becomes entangled

 47 See Graukroger (2002, pp. 165-156).

 48 See Ruffner (2000, pp. 259-277) revised in Ruffner (2010, p. 442). Whiteside and I discussed this

 document at length when I first retrieved the document in 1963. At the point of time, we both thought the
 propositions might have been Newton's musings after the close of correspondence with Flamsteed in April

 1681, more or less as Newton was said to have done with the orbital propositions following his correspon-
 dence with Hooke a year earlier. Whiteside (1970, pp. 14, 18, n. 42; 1991, pp. 17, 45, n. 43). Although
 1 now find indications of a much later date, as here, the matter is still open for others to examine in detail.

 with the particles which compose a tail and carry them away ( Principia , 1687, p. 505;

 1999, p. 925). Nevertheless the use of endeavor to recede instead of centripetal force
 in De gravitatione is the strongest argument offered by Henry and Kollerstrom for
 an early date, or at least one before the De motu tracts. The case can be strength-

 ened by invoking the numerical measure of resistance, the basis of other experiments

 considered here, and fresh considerations of key definitions.

 7 Conclusion

 The narrative that led to the wide scale acceptance of a late date has serious problems,

 starting with failure to examine the numbers. It seems fairly obvious that by comparing

 their contents, De gravitatione was drafted before the "new" pendulum experiment,

 the De motu tracts, and most likely Halley's visit. Newton had considerable difficulty

 recreating the basic Kepler-motion solutions followed quickly by concern about the
 effects of perturbation that show the limitations of those solutions. It is also clear
 he had become fully engaged in a revival of his work on the comet of 1680. These

 were incredibly difficult issues that Newton was determined to get to the bottom of. It

 does not seem likely that he would also rush to prepare what was originally intended

 as an elementary treatise on hydrostatics. If I am right, the chronologies and docu-
 ment sequences of Dobbs or others who place it as part of the process of composing
 the Principia fall apart. Placing it earlier in 1684 as the aftermath to thoughts on
 the fluidity of the heavens in work on Philosophicae origines is also problematic.
 The main difficulty is Newton presumably would have been seeking to prove that
 celestial aether has little or no resistance, a task not adequately treated in De gravitati-

 one and only by way of a digression. Moreover, we would expect to find Humphrey

 Newton's handwriting in such a relatively polished effort. Indeed would he have taken

 time to bring together various rougher drafts as Dobbs and others suggest? Perhaps

 there is a slim possibility for composition before Humphrey's arrival about the time he

 started work on reviving the ancient truths, but some documentation would be needed.

 The inconvenient truth about Newton's manuscripts is that given a nearly lifelong

 interest in certain major themes they can be arbitrarily sorted in different sequences

 and seemingly plausible stories invented, without strong hooks to datable material.
 Perhaps independent reasons can be developed to establish a late date for the invoca-
 tion of the term inertia. Lacking such reasons, Newton's lectures on hydrostatics in
 1671 noted by Feingold (2004) offer one of the most plausible early dates and pur-
 poses. Unfortunately, the only evidence we have for these lectures is a mere mention
 in a document discovered by Feingold (personal communication, Bodleian Library
 Ms Smith 8, f. 147). Henry (201 1) also offers an attractive new beginning, with fur-

 ther arguments yet to offer. Elements of Dobbs' (1991) analysis also remain in play.
 Different times and circumstances are not ruled out, however. Sources sufficient for

 the composition of De gravitatione were available by 1668 or 1669. The particular
 sources Newton used and when he focused on various items is another matter that

 needs renewed scrutiny. And if the document is a compilation, then there needs to be

 explicit distinction between older and newer materials. The fate of the date remains

 open.
