 Abstract Models of planetary motion as observed from Earth must account for two

 principal anomalies: the nonuniform speed of the planet as it circles the zodiac, and the

 correlation of the planet's position with the position of the Sun. In the context of the

 geometrical models used by the Greeks, the practical difficulty is to somehow isolate

 the motion of the epicycle center on the deferent from the motion of the planet on its

 epicycle. One way to isolate the motion of the epicycle center is to determine the lon-

 gitude and time of oppositions of the planet with the mean Sun. A Greek astronomer
 might have realized that the predictions of mean oppositions by Babylonian models
 could serve as useful proxies for real empirical observations. It is shown that a Greek

 astronomer with a reasonable understanding of Babylonian System A models for the
 outer planets and the Sun-Moon could have used those models to estimate approxi-
 mate values for the eccentricity e and longitude of apogee A required for geometrical
 models. The same method would work for the inner planets if conjunctions were

 observable, but they are not, and the variation of the observable synodic events - first

 and last morning and evening visibilities - is dominated more by the motion of the

 planet in latitude than the nonuniform motion of the epicycle center.

 Models of planetary motion as observed from Earth must account for two principal
 anomalies: (1) the nonuniform speed of the planet as it circles the zodiac, and (2) the

 correlation of the planet's position with the position of the Sun. In the context of the

 geometrical models used by the Greeks, the practical difficulty is to somehow isolate
 the motion of the epicycle center on the deferent, which is responsible for the first

 anomaly, from the motion of the planet on its epicycle, which is responsible for the

 second anomaly. This then allows determination of, first, the eccentricity e and longi-

 tude A of the apogee of the deferent and the positions Àoof the epicycle center and ão

 of the planet on the epicycle at some time to , and second, the radius r of the epicycle.

 One way to isolate the motion of the epicycle center for the outer planets is to

 determine the longitude and time of oppositions of the planet with the mean Sun. At

 the moment of such an opposition, the radius of the epicycle is pointing directly at
 the Earth and so the size of the epicycle has no impact. Even so, the determination
 of the longitude and time of opposition is not easy. It requires both a sequence of
 timed longitude measurements of the planet both before and after opposition, while

 the planet's motion is retrograde, and an adequately calibrated solar theory to get the

 corresponding longitudes of the mean sun. The actual longitude and time of opposition

 is then a result of some sort of data reduction scheme. Using just three such oppositions

 and an elegant iterative geometrical analysis, Ptolemy shows in Almagest X-XI how

 to determine e, A, Xo, and ão (Toomer 1984). It turns out, however, that the parameter

 values determined using this method are extremely sensitive to small variations in the

 input data. It seems likely, in fact, that the values of the final model parameters found

 in th Q Almagest are the culmination of a chain of developments using simpler methods
 that may well have extended over several decades, if not centuries (Duke 2005a). With

 these simpler methods one can use several more oppositions, perhaps a dozen or more,

 to determine the parameters and to a large extent avoid the extreme sensitivity that
 afflicts the Almagest method (Evans 1998, p. 362-368). Either way, once the values
 of e, A, Xo, and ão are determined, a simple analysis of a single observation of the

 planet away from opposition yields a value for the epicycle radius r. Implicit in both

 analyses is a rough knowledge of the mean motions on the deferent and the epicycle,
 but these are easily determined using well-known period relations.

 Given the extensive observational program required to determine the oppositions

 of each outer planet with the mean Sun, it would certainly not be surprising to suppose

 that if a shortcut was available for getting the empirical information necessary for
 determining the model parameters, some Greek astronomer(s) would use it, either for

 some sort of preliminary or exploratory analysis, or to confirm a conventional analysis
 of the type outlined above, or perhaps even in lieu of real observations. Thus, a Greek

 astronomer might have realized that, to the extent that they agree with observation, the

 predictions of mean oppositions by Babylonian models could serve as useful proxies
 for real empirical observations.

 In addition, however, a Greek astronomer might also have realized how to extract

 from System A models for the outer planets the very nonuniform time variation of

 model angles that his kinematical models are designed to produce, namely the equa-
 tion of center q - к - À, which is the difference between the true and mean longitude
 of the epicycle center. In particular, in the geometrical models, at least as formulated

 in the Almagest , the time t is the independent variable and the equation of center is
 given as a function of the eccentricity e and the angle

 In the above equations the normalization is such that the total eccentricity of the
 eccentric model is the same as the Earth-equant distance in the equant model,
 namely le.

 In System A models the true longitude к is the independent variable and the time

 and mean longitude are functions of À, so it is convenient to invert the above relations

 and give q as a function of the angle у - X - A. Thus, for the eccentric we have

 These expressions for the equation of center are qualitatively similar to each other but
 differ in some details. For both models q = 0 at apogee and perigee, which are in each

 model 180° apart, and the extreme values of q are symmetric about the À-axis, with
 values dhsin_1(2e/^) for the eccentric and ±2 tan-1 (e/R) for the equant, the latter

 being smaller than the former (see Fig. 1). The models differ, however, in that while
 for the eccentric the extreme values are 1 80° apart, for the equant the distance from

 maximum to minimum, and hence crossing apogee, is smaller than the distance from

 minimum to maximum, crossing perigee. Consequently, for the eccentric we have

 Fig. 1 A comparison of the equation of center for an eccentric (dashed line) and an equant (solid line). The

 eccentricity is intentionally large so that the differences can be seen. However, the differences are much
 smaller for all real planets relevant for ancient astronomy

 so that the derivative of q for the equant is larger in absolute magnitude at apogee

 than at perigee. We will see later that this property of the equant is reflected in most
 System A models for the outer planets, although whether anyone realized that is at

 present unclear.

 In any event, however, note that knowledge of where q = 0 when its extrema are

 equidistant from the À-axis gives the apogee and perigee of the deferent, and both the

 values of dqldk atq = 0 and the extreme values of q give estimates for e/R. Our task
 now is to see how a Greek astronomer could with relative ease determine the effective

 equation of center q (A.) implied by a System A model, and hence estimate e and A by

 comparing the functions given above with his System A estimates.

 Thus the plan of this paper is to

 (a) assume that some Greek astronomers were trying to explain the zodiacal anomaly
 using geometrical models in a way that isolates the zodiacal anomaly from the
 effects of the solar anomaly,

 (b) assume that the Greek astronomers understood enough about how System A plan-
 etary models work to realize that they might be useful for such an explanation,

 (c) discuss whether it is even possible to use System A models to estimate the param-
 eters of Greek geometrical models using methods that are plausible for Greek
 mathematicians.

 Regarding assumption (a), Ptolemy, speaking of Hipparchus, writes (Toomer 1984):

 For, we may presume , he [Hipparchus] thought that one must not only show that

 each planet has a twofold anomaly , or that each planet has retrograde arcs which
 are not constant, and are of such and such sizes (whereas the other astronomers

 had constructed there geometrical proofs on the basis of a single unvarying anom-

 aly and retrograde arc); nor that these anomalies can in fact be represented either

 by means of eccentric circles or by circles eccentric with the ecliptic, and carry-
 ing epicycles, or even combining both , the ecliptic anomaly being of such and

 such size , and the synodic anomaly of such and such (for these representations

 have been employed by almost all of those who have tried to exhibit the uniform

 circular motion by means of the so-called 'Aeon-tables', but their attempts were

 faulty and at the same time lacked proofs: some of them did not achieve their

 object at all, the others only to a limited extent); but, he reckoned that one who

 has reached such a pitch of accuracy and love of truth throughout the mathemat-
 ical sciences will not be content to stop at the above point, like the others who
 did not care. . . (italics added).

 So, although Ptolemy does not directly say that Hipparchus left the informa-

 tion above in his writings, he is at least willing to 'presume' what Hipparchus was
 thinking - that it was important to explain both anomalies with geometrical models,
 and that while many people had tried, none had yet succeeded. If Ptolemy was willing

 to presume that, then I suggest we should also be willing. This conclusion is fur-
 ther supported by the Hindu planetary models, which are generally considered to be

 pre-Ptolemaic and which definitely are geometrical attempts to explain both anoma-
 lies (Neugebauer 1956; Pingree 1976, 1978; Duke 2005b), and which may in fact be
 among those Ptolemy, and as he presumed, Hipparchus, were alluding to above.

 Assumption (b) is supported by the fact that Greek papyri give System A plane-

 tary model results using parameters adopted by Greek astronomers (Britton and Jones

 2000). Such adaptations show clearly that at least some Greek astronomers were capa-

 ble of understanding the structure of System A models well enough to modify them

 and bring them into conformance with Greek astronomy and Greek calendars.

 As will be explained in detail in the following, given assumptions (a) and (b) the
 question posed in point (c) can be answered in the affirmative. In particular, however,

 while there is very tentative evidence discussed below from a papyrus that might be
 associated with Mars that someone might have gone down the path we discuss, that

 evidence is far from conclusive and might even be an illusion. Nevertheless, that does

 not affect the main result of this paper - that the proposed scenario might have plau-

 sibly happened. However unsatisfactory all of the uncertainty may seem, it is really
 no different than the same uncertainty we face in many other places in the history of

 ancient mathematical astronomy. We can see that some development was possible, and
 we can see that if some development happened then it would explain something we

 do reliably see, but we simply have no direct evidence to support the original premise

 that the said development did occur.

 Unlike the Greek geometrical models, which are kinematical and based on explic-

 itly continuous motion in space and time, the Babylonian models are based entirely on
 simple arithmetic and aim to explain only the location in space and time of a sequence
 of synodic events, which are appearances of a planet in a given relationship to a uni-
 formly moving Sun, which a Greek astronomer would identify as the mean Sun. In
 order to clearly understand the underlying phenomena, let us begin by considering

 conjunctions of an outer planet, say Jupiter, with the Sun, and for now ignore the fact
 that such conjunctions are not in fact visible. Suppose that we see such a conjunction
 at a time t when the Sun and Jupiter both have longitude к. Let us now suppose that

 the next conjunction occurs at some known longitude к -f Ак. Our problem is to find
 the time this next conjunction occurs. Since the Sun moves much faster around the

 zodiac than Jupiter does, the time interval At between conjunctions is the time it takes

 the Sun to complete one full orbit from к back to À, which is of course 1 year of

 y 365^d, plus the time it takes the Sun to go the additional distance AÀ. If the Sun
 moves uniformly, or more realistically, if we simply assume the Sun moves uniformly,

 whether it does or not, then the Sun will complete the final А к in time AX/ws , where

 and in fact this is exactly how the Babylonian System A models computed the time

 interval between synodic events for the outer planets, except that they had to allow for

 the fact that they used tithis, schematic days equal to l/30th of a lunar month, instead of

 days, and they approximated the Sun's speed as '°/tlthl . Note that this computation of

 the time interval remains the same if we use oppositions rather than conjunctions, and

 in fact if you use events at any constant elongation of the planet and the Sun. This line

 of analysis was first elaborated by van der Waerden, who called it his "Sun-distance
 principle" (van der Waerden 1974; see also Schmidt 1969).1

 Stations and horizon phenomena such as acronychal rising and first and last visibil-

 ity were considered and modeled by Babylonian astronomers. However, it is difficult

 to accurately determine by observation both the position and time of these events, and

 it is only approximately true that the planet has a fixed relation to a uniformly moving

 Sun, or the real Sun, for that matter, in a sequence of such events. Whether or not the

 Babylonian astronomers understood the calculation in this way is, for our purposes,

 not important. What is important is that a Greek astronomer might have realized that

 the mathematical constraints and assumptions built into System A models, and in par-

 ticular the assumption of a fixed relationship to a uniformly moving Sun, match very

 well with the actual properties of mean oppositions in geometrical models.

 The following discussion will use algebraic notation for the convenience of the
 modern reader, but there is of course no implication that any ancient mathematician

 used such methods. What is important is that all of the operations needed are within
 reach of known Hellenistic mathematical methods.

 Fundamental to System A are integral period relations (Aaboe 1958). Let Y, L, A

 (not to be confused with apogee) andZ be positive integers, with A and Z relatively

 prime, and suppose that in Y years a planet, and most important for our purposes, the

 epicycle center, completes L revolutions in the zodiac, during which A synodic events
 of the same kind are observed, and the location of the synodic events completes Z
 revolutions in the zodiac. For the outer planets

 and for the inner planets

 Y = L + A

 Y = L

 1 An excellent exposition of van der Waerden's (1974) analysis of System A based on his Sun-distance
 principle may be found in his Science Awakening II.

 The relations given above are all average values, and in reality the arcs and intervals

 between successive synodic events fluctuate about the mean, but the period relations

 tell us that if a synodic event is observed at some longitude Ào, then after Y years and

 A successive events, and not before, the location of the synodic event will return to A.o,

 having circled the zodiac Z times, and the epicycle will have circled the zodiac L times,

 so that the event will have landed on A - 1 distinct other values of к in the process.
 System A models this by distributing Ak's on a circle at intervals /,, i = 1. . .Л, and

 successive synodic events progress in steps of Z intervals (Aaboe 1964). In principle,

 the A intervals /, are of arbitrary size subject to the constraint

 382 D. Duke

 but, in reality, synodic arcs and intervals vary smoothly as a function of longitude, so

 for this reason and for computational efficiency the Babylonian astronomers assumed

 that the intervals are constant in zones of the ecliptic, with the number N of zones

 in all known systems being between two and six, and usually not of equal size. With
 N zones of size a, and constant interval /,, there are N¡ = a,-//,- intervals in the ith
 zone, and

 л

 i='

 £/, = збо°

 N

 1=1

 Usually, but not necessarily, the N¡ intervals completely fill each zone and N¡ is an

 integer. A synodic arc tu, = Z/, is associated with each zone, so a¡ / tu,- is the number
 (integer plus fraction) of such arcs in the ith zone. Since there are P arcs in 360°, the

 values of tu, are subject to the constraint

 N N AT Г 1 N A
 Nili AT Г 1 1 A A

 tu- w* ~ z Z/' / ~~Z Z i ~ Z Z _

 ,=1 tu- w* ,= i Z/' z / ~~Z Z ,=i Z Z

 Furthermore, if an event lands in the ith zone at some k, then the next event will be Z

 intervals farther, regardless of the size of the intervals. Thus if the next position is still

 in the ith zone, then its longitude is kf = к + tu,- = к -h Z/,-, but if that position is in
 the ( i + l)th zone its longitude will be kf = к H- m/, H- (Z - m)/,+i , where к -h m/,

 is the longitude of the beginning of the (i + l)th zone, and similarly if the event lies
 in the (i + 2)th zone (as actually happens for Mars and Mercury).

 Since A/Z = Tz/Ta , the relation^ = § may be rewritten as

 For Saturn and Jupiter Z = L and 7z = 7¿, so the epicycle has mean speed

 ví = jí = =4 in the ith sector, and the sum of the times spent in each sector, which
 are di/ Vi, is the time Tz = required for the epicycle to complete a single trip
 around the zodiac.

 For Mars we can use instead

 Z w~i=Ž cti _ A ^ = I' A Z + Z A = _TL( Ta A' z)

 w~i=Ž _ ^ = I' Z = Ta ' z)

 or

 Щ ' 'A = п

 ' 'A

 where rA = TA/(l + A/Z) = TA-TL.

 There is one remaining problem to be addressed. If the planet is in opposition to
 the mean Sun, and in time interval Та = y H- AXz/cos the planet advances an amount
 Wi while the mean Sun advances an amount A Àz, then at the end of the time interval

 the planet is not in fact in opposition to the mean Sun. System A planetary models

 resolve this problem by adjusting the time interval for a synodic arc AX of length Wi

 according to

 At =Ãi+^(Ak-Ãkz)

 = Ta + - - for Saturn and Jupiter

 , (Wi - A kz)

 so that the time interval required for the planet to advance w¡ differs from the

 mean time by the amount that the time required for the Sun to advance w¡ differs
 from the time required to advance the mean distance A Xz (van der Waerden
 1974, p. 256). Note that for Saturn and Jupiter, Ta is close to 400 days, while
 (wi - AXz)/o>s is about ±1 day for Saturn and ±3days for Jupiter, so the correction

 from mean to true time is not significant. However, for Mars T'A is about 93 days

 and ( Wi - ~KXz)/cos varies between about -19d and 41d, so the correction is quite

 important.

 The adjustment of the time intervals, and hence the implied speeds of the epicycle,

 does not upset the constraint on the u>, values. For Saturn and Jupiter the true speeds
 in each sector are now

 Thus the constraint imposed by the period relation still holds exactly, and the epicycle

 in each case still completes one revolution in 7¿ years. In passing, note that if we had
 assumed that

 At = TA + p (u)i - Akz)

 for any value of p , then the periodicity will still be preserved.

 Using the above analysis it is now straightforward to find the equation of center
 q{k) = к - к for the outer planets. Since each System A model is a sequence of

 zones, we have that A k¡ = a, in each zone. Since v¡ is constant in each zone, the time
 required to traverse each zone is Ar,- = a¡/v¡ and during that time interval the mean

 longitude advances by the amount A k¡ = coi Ar,- . Thus, from the beginning to the end
 of each zone, <7, changes by the amount

 A q¡ = A ki - A ki

 and dq/dk in each zone is, for the piecewise linear System A models, exactly equal to

 From the values Aq¡ one can reconstruct q and adjust its level so that the extreme

 values are equidistant from the À-axis, and the longitude A of apogee will be where
 q(k) crosses the axis in a descending direction. Then, from the extreme values of q

 and from the slopes of q in the zones where q crosses the À-axis, we can get estimates
 of e.

 The parameters defining the various planetary models are available in many places

 (Jones 1998, see particularly Table 2, p. 6). 2 The following charts compare for each

 outer planet the functions q(k) derived from the known System A models with the
 q(X) that follows from the equant using the parameters in the Almagest (Figs. 2, 3,
 and 4).3

 Although the discussion to this point has been entirely hypothetical, there is some

 evidence that might suggest the analysis discussed above was actually done by some
 ancient Greek astronomer. Neugebauer suggested that the contents of two Greco-
 Roman papyrus fragments are evidence for a greatly modified Babylonian System A

 scheme for Mars (Neugebauer 1942, 1960), based on the fact that the heading for one
 of the six tables is Taurus-Gemini, which is also one of the six System A zones for

 Mars and, according to Neugebauer, the only known use of a Taurus-Gemini pairing.
 Jones clarified and extended Neugebauer's analysis to reconstruct the six underlying
 values of Wi used in the scheme (Jones 1990), and suggested that the papyrus might

 be modeling a Greek kinematic model based on eccentricity le ^ 5, rather than the
 conventional 2e = 12. However, when a single table of very similar but not identical

 structure turned up in the papyri of Oxyrhynchus, the association with Mars and Sys-

 tem A seemed to Jones less probable (Jones 1999). Nevertheless, in light of the above

 analysis in this paper, and in spite of the tenuous connection of the papyrus with either

 Mars or System A, it is worth considering an alternative interpretation, namely that
 the papyrus documents an analysis of Mars' equation of center q from a System A
 scheme, much as outlined above. Indeed, let us consider a Mars scheme as above

 and assume the numbers given in the papyrus are not Wi values, as assumed by Neu-

 gebauer and Jones, but are instead w ¡ values. Then from the w- values one may derive
 both the underlying values for the scheme, which are

 ^ In particular, the charts use the tropical longitude of apogee values that Ptolemy assigns for about A.D.

 Babylonian System A models, and kt is a longitude in year yt. See, for example, Rochberg (1998).

 chart. If this interpretation is correct, then the scheme in the papyrus is clearly not
 derived directly from the standard Babylonian System A scheme, but we cannot rule
 out that it was derived from some other scheme that does not differ too much from

 the standard scheme. Indeed, it seems possible that it might be an incomplete account
 of an attempt to derive a System A scheme starting with a geometric model of Mars,

 but I see no way to advance the argument further given that the papyrus gives no hint
 about how the numbers were ever used.

 The apogees and perigees in the various System A models are shown in Table 1.

 Note that in some case the apogees and perigees are not 180° apart.

 To get the e implied by a System A model, we compute ^ = 1 - for the zones

 which ascend and descend through the X-axis, and from these slopes we compute the

 results are shown in Table 2.

 For comparison, the Almagest values of e give the slopes in Table 3.
 Generally, one would expect the widest zones to be associated with the fastest

 speeds, and vice versa, and so the perigee would fall in the widest zone and the apogee
 in the shortest. This is indeed the case for Jupiter, and for Mars all of the zones are

 equal width (60°) so the rule is indeterminate. For Saturn, the usual two-zone System
 A model has the situation reversed - the slow zone is shorter than the fast zone. How-

 ever, there is an alternate Saturn model, denoted A' in the table, in which the slow

 zone is wider, in agreement with expectations (Swerdlow 1998).

 The three Jupiter System A models have the same minimum and maximum synodic

 arcs (30° and 36°), and so give the same values for àqlák and e(A) and e(P). Note that

 e(A) agrees exactly with the Almagest value, but e(P) is too small. For the Babylonian

 Mars model both e(P) and e(A) are too large, and for the Mars model suggested by the
 papyrus, both e(P) and e(A) are too small. For Saturn, all of the values are too small.

 Note also that for all the Mars and Jupiter models, and Saturn System A' but not

 System A, the values of àqlák are generally of the form suggested by the equant: àqlák
 (A) is more negative than d#/dÀ(P) is positive. Whether this reflects some observable

 property of the synodic arcs, or whether it was noticed by our assumed Greek astron-

 omer and somehow motivated the equant, or is simply an artifact of the System A
 construction constraints, is not clear.

 An alternative method to find e is to use the extreme values of q (k) . For the eccentric

 model these are sin-1 (2 e/R), and for the equant 2 tan ~l(e/R). The resulting values
 are in Table 4.

 In the models with only two zones the sharp breaks at the maximum and minimum

 values of q do not model the function very well and are responsible for the discordant

 values of e derived from the extreme values of q . The models with more zones gener-
 ally improve the models near the maxima and this is reflected in better estimates of e.

 We have seen that for oppositions of the outer planets with the mean Sun it is useful

 to think of System A in terms of a discrete set of A points distributed around the
 zodiac, with subsets of the points evenly distributed at intervals /, in zones of width

 а/. Within the ith zone it is useful to think of the epicycle center as moving through
 adjacent points at a constant speed

 where col is the mean motion in longitude of the epicycle center. Then the change in
 the equation of center is simply Aq¿ = /, - AL/. Note that the additive correction to

 Ta in the expression for v¡ accounts for the fact that when the epicycle center advances

 by a distance w¡ instead of the average distance w = Akz , the faster-moving mean

 Sun will return to opposition with the epicycle center in time At = y + ^-instead of

 the average time At = Ta = y H- ~ (in these expressions we have y for Jupiter and
 Saturn, which becomes 2 y for Mars).

 Note also that instead of referring the opposition to the mean Sun and the epicycle

 center, we could just as well refer to the planet and its epicycle center, as long as we

 use the mean motion on the epicycle referred not to the epicycle apogee, in which case

 the speed would be the mean motion in anomaly coa = cos- col, but to a fixed sidereal
 direction, in which case the speed is simply cos = col + coa- Relative to such a fixed

 sidereal direction, e.g. the apogee of the deferent, the epicycle center advances on the

 deferent by w¿ and the planet advances on its epicycle by 360°+ w¡ in time interval

 Thus, we can understand that the reason that a geometrical analysis of the System A

 models actually works, and that the same System A model works for multiple synodic

 phenomena, is that the various synodic phenomena for the outer planets are, in fact,
 all reasonably consistent with the System A assumption that synodic intervals in time
 are linear functions of the synodic arcs in longitude, and that the slope of the line is

 l/a>s, where cos is the uniform speed of the planets on its epicycle relative to a fixed
 sidereal direction.

 Inferior and superior conjunctions of the inner planets with the true Sun are, in

 principle, essentially identical to the above treatment of the outer planets. For an inner
 planet the epicycle center moves with variable speed around the deferent, the varia-
 tion is about the mean speed col - cos of the Sun, and the planet moves uniformly
 on its epicycle with speed cop = cos + coa measured with respect to a fixed sidereal
 direction.4 Thus all of the results discussed above would be immediately applicable if

 4 Measuring the mean motion of a planet, outer or inner, on its epicycle with respect to a fixed sidereal
 direction is seen in the Keskintos Inscription (ca. 100 B.C.) (Jones 2006); throughout all of ancient Hindu

 astronomy, generally thought to be of Greek origin and pre-Ptolemaic (Duke 2008, and references therein);
 and in Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, but not the Almagest (Duke 2009).

 distribution for oppositions of the real Sun and the mean Moon. The nearly vertical line through the center
 shows the same distribution for oppositions of the mean Sun and the real Moon. In all cases the points
 anywhere along the upper and lower edges have the Moon near apogee and perigee, respectively, and the
 points anywhere along the left and right edges have the Sun near apogee and perigee

 not for the fact that (1) conjunctions of an inner planet with the Sun are not observable

 due to the glare of the Sun, and (2) for a variety of reasons, but principally the motion

 in latitude, the synodic time intervals and synodic arcs in longitude of the first and
 last visibilities do not, in general, all have the same linear relationship and so do not
 satisfy the expected relationships

 As a result, while the System A models for Mercury and Venus do a credible job of
 modeling the observed synodic phenomena,5 they do not do a good job of modeling
 the nonuniform movement of the epicycle center around the deferent and so do not

 yield useful information regarding the parameters of geometrical models.

 Synodic months for the Moon-Sun system are strongly influenced by the nonuni-
 form motion of both the Moon and the Sun. The figure below shows the synodic
 time interval At versus the synodic arc Ak for all full moons in the 100-year interval
 beginning with -200 January 1 (Fig. 5).

 The events along the left and right vertical edges occur when the Sun is near apogee

 and perigee, respectively, and similarly, those along the lower and upper horizontal
 edges occur when the Moon is near perigee and apogee. If in reality the Sun was mov-

 ing nonuniformly and the Moon uniformly, the distribution would collapse vertically
 and the events would all be on a line of relatively shallow slope of the form

 Fig. 6 The distribution of synodic arcs (dÀ) vs. synodic time intervals (di) from the Babylonian lunar
 System A for all full moons between -200 ВСЕ and -100 ВСЕ ( small diamonds ) compared to reality
 (i open circles ). The large vertical extension in time shows the effect of column G and is entirely due to
 lunar anomaly. The small vertical extension in time shows the effect of column J and is entirely due to
 solar anomaly. The solid lines through the center thus show the distribution of System A full moons if
 there was only a lunar anomaly ( vertical line) or only a solar anomaly (nearly horizontal line). The heavy

 accumulation of points along the left and right edges for System A reflects the fact that lunar System A has

 only two zones, and most synodic arcs are entirely contained in one of the zones. The sparse points not on

 an edge are the arcs that cross a zone boundary. The lack of a slant to the right in the System A distributions

 is due to the fact that System A adjusts the synodic time interval, but not the synodic arc, for the effects of
 lunar (col. G) and solar (col. J) anomaly

 where col is the lunar mean motion in longitude. Syzygies at the extreme left and right

 ends of this line therefore have the Sun moving at minimum and maximum speed,

 respectively, and the Moon moving at mean speed. On the other hand, if in reality
 the Moon was moving nonuniformly and the Sun uniformly, the distribution would

 collapse horizontally and the events would all be on a line (red in the figure above) of

 relatively steep slope of the form

 Syzygies at the extreme upper and lower ends of this line therefore have the Moon
 moving at minimum and maximum speed, respectively, and the Sun moving at mean
 speed. Note that the lines cross at the point w = 29.1 Io and At = 29.53d, which are
 the mean synodic arc and synodic time for the Moon-Sun system.

 The System A model for the Moon incorporates the nonuniform motion of both the
 Moon and the Sun, and so the analysis is somewhat more involved that we found for
 the outer and inner planets (van der Waerden 1974, pp. 210-236). The synodic event
 is assumed to advance by arcs of w' = 30° and W2 = 28 */8° in its two zones and
 the time interval At is 29d plus two corrections, both given in units of large hours H,

 which are four regular hours or l/6th of a day (the major unit in the vertical scale of the

 figure). One correction, column G, depends on how far the Moon is from its apogee,

 and the second, column J, depends on how far the Sun is from its apogee. Column G

 assumes that the Sun is in its fast zone, and so near the right vertical edge of the chart,

 and the correction to At given by column G varies between about 2 2/3 H to just short

 of 5H , in good agreement with the real variation, as shown in the figure below (Clarke

 and Steele 2002). When the Sun is in its fast zone, and so near the right edge of the

 chart, column J gives no correction, but when the Sun is in its slow zone, and so near

 the left vertical edge of the chart, column J subtracts about 0;57H from A t, again in
 good agreement with reality (Fig. 6).

 In order to estimate the values of e/R and r/R implied by the System A lunar

 theory, we may use the values of А к and At at the endpoints of the central lines. In

 general, syzygies on the nearly horizontal central line have

 As(0 = Às (t) + qs(t) = Ãm(0

 and from any two successive syzygies at times t' and t2 we get the relation

 AÀ = cosAt + q{ti) - q(t') = 0)y[At

 where o>s and сом are the mean motions in longitude of the Sun and Moon. Syzygies
 at the ends of the line have as = ks - = 0°or 180° and so q(t') = 0°and since
 in the time interval А/ we have as advancing by the amount cosAt we have, with

 1 = сом - cos,

 at apogee and

 q{tl) = sin-1 ^ sin (AÀ)^ = r¡At

 q(t2) = sin-1 sin (AA. + 180°)^ = rjAt

 at perigee. Solving these for e/R we find e = 2.26 and e = 1.92, which average to
 e = 2.09 and which is close to the true value.

 Similarly, for syzygies on the vertical central line we have

 *м(0 = ^м(0 H- <7м(0 = ks(t)

 and from any two successive syzygies at times t' and t2 we get the relation

 AX = comAí + q(t2) - q(t') = cosAt

 In this case ам advances by the amount АЛ - (сом - o)a)A t, where coa is the lunar
 mean motion in anomaly, and we find

 r _ sin(rçA/)
 R sin(AÀ - (сом - û>a)A t)

 R sin(AÀ - (<¿>m - coa)At -f 180°)

 at perigee, which yield r - 4.74 and r = 6.39, 6 and which average to 5.57, somewhat

 larger than the true value which is near 5.25.

 In summary, it seems plausible that a Greek astronomer with a reasonable under-
 standing of Babylonian System A models for the outer planets and the Sun-Moon
 could have used those models to estimate the zodiacal variation of the equation of

 center for each planet, and from this, approximate values for the eccentricity e and
 longitude of apogee Ad required for geometrical models. The same method would
 work for the inner planets if conjunctions were observable, but they are not, and the

 variation of the observable synodic events - first and last morning and evening visibil-

 ities - is dominated more by the motion of the planet in latitude than the nonuniform

 motion of the epicycle center.
