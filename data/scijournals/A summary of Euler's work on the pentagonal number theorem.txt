 Abstract In this article, we give a summary of Leonhard Euler's work on the pen-
 tagonal number theorem. First we discuss related work of earlier authors and Euler
 himself. We then review Euler's correspondence, papers and notebook entries about

 the pentagonal number theorem and its applications to divisor sums and integer parti-

 tions. In particular, we work out the details of an unpublished proof of the pentagonal
 number theorem from Euler's notebooks. As we follow Euler's discovery and proofs

 of the pentagonal number theorem, we pay attention to Euler's ideas about when we
 can consider a mathematical statement to be true. Finally, we discuss related results

 in the theory of analytic functions.

 This is true as a formal identity; see Rademacher 1973, Chap. 12 for a rigorous expla-
 nation of formal power series. This is true analytically for all complex x such that
 M < 1.

 This result is called the pentagonal number theorem because the numbers con =

 n(3n - l)/2 are the pentagonal numbers , a type of polygonal number. Euler clearly
 explains polygonal numbers in his Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra (1770, §§402-
 439); here we give a brief summary. The nth m-gonal number is the sum of the first

 n terms of the arithmetic progression starting at 1 with difference m - 2. For exam-

 ple, the nth triangular number (=3-gonal number) isl+2 + ЗН

 The nth square number (=4-gonal number) is 1 + 3 + 5 H

 n + 2(1 -f 2 + • • • + (n - 1)) = n2. The nth pentagonal number (=5-gonal number)
 is 1 + 4 + 7 + - - ■ + (1 + 3(n - 1)) = n + 3(1 + 2 + . . . + (n - 1)) =

 The pentagonal numbers con are the numbers of points that can be arranged to
 form homothetic pentagons of side length n with n evenly spaced points on each side,
 n = 1, 2, . . .. Figure 1 shows this for n = 1, 2, 3, 4.

 It will be useful to give an equivalent definition of polygonal numbers. A sequence
 ao, я i , . . . is an arithmetic progression of order n if A nak is the same for all к. The

 nth differences are defined by Дя* = аь+' - я* and А п_ия* = Апя*+1 - А пя*.
 m-gonal numbers are second-order arithmetic progressions starting at 1 with a second

 difference of m - 2. Thus, the triangular numbers have second difference 1 , the squares
 have second differences 2, the pentagonal numbers have second differences 3, etc.

 The purpose of this article is to give a summary of Euler's work on the pentagonal
 number theorem. First, in §2, we mention related earlier work; in particular we give a
 sketch of similar work of Euler's on the infinite products for sin z and Ç (s). Then, in

 §3, we outline Euler's discussions in his correspondence about the pentagonal number
 theorem and explain his published proofs of it. Then, we examine an unpublished
 proof from Euler's notebooks and fill in the missing details. In §§4 and 5, we review
 Euler's use of the pentagonal number theorem to prove recurrence relations for the

 sum of divisors function and partition function, respectively. Finally, in §6, we look
 at the infinite product (1 - x)(l - x2)(l - x 3) • • • explicitly as a complex function.

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 303

 Let us take a moment to explain what this article is useful for. First, it is a more or

 less exhaustive and reliable reference for use in further study of Euler's work - partic-

 ularly his extension of the toolbox in analysis of infinite expressions we are familiar

 with to include infinite products with variable terms - and succeeding work on elliptic

 functions and analytic number theory (cf. Patterson 2007, p. 51 1 on determining the
 argument of Gauss sums). We can sort out the following timeline from the mass of
 details:

 1740 After being asked about partitions by Philippe Naudé junior in Naudé's August

 29, 1740 letter, Euler investigates the products П/jli ьгрг FEiii 0 -xn).
 Euler discovers the pentagonal number theorem, and seems to have first men-
 tioned it in a November 30, 1740 letter to Daniel Bernoulli.

 1741 Euler states the pentagonal number theorem without proof at the end of his

 "Observationes analyticae variae de combinationibus", El 58. The paper is
 presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on April 6, 1741, but is not published
 until 1751.

 1747 Euler finds that the pentagonal number theorem implies an unexpected recur-
 rence relation for sums of divisors, and mentions this first to Goldbach in

 his March 21/April 1, 1747 letter, and then in his "Découverte d'une loi tout

 extraordinaire des nombres, par rapport à la somme de leurs diviseurs", El 75,

 presented to the Berlin Academy on June 22, 1747 and published in 1751.

 1748 The pentagonal number theorem appears without proof in Euler's Introductio

 in analysin infinitorum , E101.

 1750 Euler works out a proof of the pentagonal number theorem, which he sends first

 to Goldbach on June 9, 1750. This proof is then published in Euler's "Demonst-
 ratio theorematis circa ordinem in summis divisorům observatum", E244, in
 1760.

 1775 Euler revisits the pentagonal number theorem in two papers, E541 and E542.

 Second, this article begins by describing Euler's infinite product for sin z (which
 involves Newton's identities for the roots and coefficients of polynomials) and his
 infinite product for Ç(s). The article also refers to Euler's work on summing related
 infinite series (namely in E 190) and finding expressions for certain series in terms
 of more workable functions. The pentagonal number theorem is a significant case of

 Euler's strategy to find different expressions for the same thing and to exploit these to
 find out new facts.

 Third, this is a detailed case study for Euler's work habits. Following the life of a
 discovery is an excellent way to appreciate Euler's persistent work solving problems,

 investigating related problems, and then taking up the topic again later, refining the
 solutions that he had found and contriving other related problems.

 Fourth and finally, this article carefully shows Euler's understanding of the pentag-
 onal number theorem's changing epistemological status (cf. Pólya 1954, Chap. VI).
 Examples of a statement can either just show that it is true in various cases, or can
 give insight into how a general proof of the statement would work. The pentagonal
 number theorem is an excellent case for understanding the relation to Euler between

 examples of a theorem that seem like they could be generalized and a general proof

 of the theorem. Having the right notation can let us see more clearly how an argument

 product notation.

 works and then how to carry it out in general; this article shows the notation that

 Euler used, and explains these arguments using subscript notation and summation and

 An equivalent statement to the pentagonal number theorem as a formal identity is

 that if pe(n) is the number of partitions of n into an even number of distinct positive

 integers and p0{n) is the number of partitions of n into an odd number of distinct

 positive integers, then

 Pe(n) , , - Po(n , , ) = .

 , , - , , ) = '(-I)7', if n = j(3j - l)/2,

 0, otherwise, .

 (cf. Legendre 1 830, §458). We discuss an entry from Euler's notebooks that says some-

 thing like this in §5. There is an elementary proof of this version which is explained
 very clearly by Hardy and Wright (1980, §19.1 1).

 We will now introduce definitions and notation that will be used in this article. The

 sum of divisors function o{n) is defined as the sum of the positive divisors of n. The
 partition function p(n) is defined as the number of ways of writing л as a sum of
 positive integers, disregarding the order. For example, 1 + 1-1-2 and 1 + 2 + 1 are
 considered the same, while 2 + 2 and 2 + 1 + 1 are considered different. Euler uses

 the notation fn for the sum of divisors function, i.e., fn = cr(n), and ю(оо) for the
 partition function, that is w(oo) = p(n); in general he defines or (я)(,п) to be the

 number of ways of writing nasa sum of positive integers <m, disregarding the order.
 Cajori (1929, §§406^20) gives the history of the notations for the sum of divisors
 function and partition function.

 2 Background

 Pierre de Fermat (1601 or 1607/1608-1665) claims in a note (Tannery and Henry
 1891, Deuxième partie, §XVIII) to Question XXXI, Book IV of Bacheťs edition of
 Diophantus's Arithmetica that every nonnegative integer is the sum of m or fewer
 m-gonal numbers (cf. Weil 1984, Chap. II, §V). Euler remarks, e.g., in his August
 17, 1750 letter to Goldbach (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 147), and in his paper
 "Considerationes super theoremate Fermatiano de resolutione numerorum in numéros

 polygonales" (1785), presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on December 12, 1774
 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 621 ) that a very natural way to prove Fermaťs claim is to show for

 particular, to show that every nonnegative integer is the sum of four or fewer squares,

 it is equivalent to show that all the coefficients an in the power series expansion of s 4
 are nonzero. A discussion of the history of polygonal numbers is given by Dickson
 (1919b, Chap. I), who in particular notes that Fermaťs polygonal number theorem
 was first proved by Cauchy.

 Earlier work on partitions by Leibniz (1646-1716) is summarized by Knobloch

 (1974). Eneström (1908) writes about Jacob I Bernoulli's (1654-1705) study of power

 series whose exponents form a second-order arithmetic progression, like the series
 expansion in the pentagonal number theorem. For example, Bernoulli looks at the
 power series

 m - m2 H- m4 - m5 + m8 - m9 H- m13 - m14 -f m19 - • • • ,

 in his Ars Conjectandi (van der Waerden 1975, T 3, Pars Prima, Problema I), in which

 the exponents are alternately from the sequence 1 , 4, 8, 13, 19, . . . and 2, 5, 9, 14, . . .,

 which are both second-order arithmetic progressions, namely with second differences
 1. Euler writes to Carl Leonhard Gottlieb Ehler (1685-1753) on February 1 1/22, 1737

 (Smirnov 1963, pp. 369-385), about finding the sum of the series 1 + 1 + d -h ¿/3 +

 d° + -•+ d 2 +•••; this letter is R. _ 594 (Résumé _ number) in the annotated

 index of Euler's correspondence in the Opera omnia (Juškevič et al. 1975). Euler cor-

 responded with Ehler about number theory between 1735 and 1742 (see Juškevič et al.
 1975, R. 581-600). Ehler was a Bürgermeister in Danzig in 1740-1753 and presid-

 ing Bürgermeister in 1741-1742, 1745-1746 and finally 1750-1751; there were four
 Bürgermeisters in Danzig, of which one was a president and one was a vice-president.

 This question is also mentioned in a letter from Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) to Euler
 on April 14, 1742 (Fuss 1843, D. Bernoulli-Euler, Lettre XXIV). In his later paper
 "De plurimis quantitatibus transcendentibus, quas nullo modo per formulas integrales
 exprimere licet" (Euler 1784), E565 in the Eneström index (1913), presented to the
 St. Petersburg Academy on October 16, 1775 and published in the Acta in 1784, Euler
 looks at series which cannot be expressed as a closed formula using integrals of ele-

 mentary functions. For example, for |jc | < 1 the power series for the natural logarithm
 log(l +x) is which is equal to the integral of and thus the series

 я +1 can indeed be expressed as the integral of an elementary function. In

 this article Euler deals with the power series l-b*+*3+*6+.x;10+A;15-f.x;21+etc.,
 where the exponents are the triangular (3-gonal) numbers . As we observed in
 §1 the triangular numbers are a second-order arithmetic progression, with a constant
 second difference of 1 . He mentions (in §6 of E565) that if we had a finite expres-

 sion for this power series, then our problem would become resolving the cube of this

 expression into a power series and showing that all the powers of x occur: "Maximi
 autem sine dubio momenti foret, si summa huius seriei

 could be exhibited in a finite expression, however transcendental. For from this a very
 firm demonstration of the theorem of Fermat could be approached, that all integral
 numbers are the sum of three trigonal numbers; for the problem would just be to
 resolve the cube of this sum into a series and then to show that all the powers of x
 must occur."]

 Calinger (1996, §11) lists sources that Euler had read. In particular, notes sug-
 gest that Euler had examined Jacob I Bernoulli's articles on infinite series and Ars
 Conjectandi, and John Wallis's Arithmetica infinitorum , in 1725 when he was a
 student in Basel. Euler had seen Fermaťs Varia opera mathematica (in which Fer-

 mat states his polygonal number theorem mentioned in §1) in 1729 (Calinger 1996,
 §III.A), and indeed Euler mentions it in his second letter to Goldbach, on June 4,
 1730.

 In his paper "De summis serierum reciprocarum" (Euler 1740), E41, presented
 to the St. Petersburg Academy on December 5, 1735, Euler finds an expression for
 Ç (2) = namely Ç (2) = by representing sin s as an infinite product. The
 zeros of sin s are precisely л n , n an integer (Euler proves this in 1 742 as a consequence
 of his formula els = cosí + i sin s; cf. Weil 1984, Chap. III, §XIX), hence, we have

 Euler then applies Newton's identities for the roots and coefficients of a polynomial
 (given in Isaac Newton's Arithmetica universalis ; cf. Struik 1969, Chap. П, §9) to the
 roots of the above infinite product and the coefficients of the above power series to

 Sandifer (2007b, Chap. 21) thoroughly presents Euler's arguments in E41.

 In general, it is often fruitful to expand an infinite product as a power series, or to

 expand a power series as an infinite product, both as formal identities and functions
 analytic in some domain.

 Philippe Naudé junior (1684-1745) writes to Euler on August 29, 1740 (Juškevič
 et al. 1975, R. 1903). Naudé was a professor of mathematics at the Joachimsthal Gym-
 nasium in Berlin. He asks for the details on Euler's summation of Ç {In), and asks Euler

 about the number of ways to write a number m as a sum of д positive integers.

 Euler responds to Naudé on September 12/23, 1740 (Smirnov 1963, §15, pp. 179-

 206), R. 1904. He explains that he has been afflicted with weak vision for several
 weeks. Now his strength has just recently recovered, and he has read Naudé's letter

 with great pleasure. Euler says that Naudé's problem about the partition of numbers
 seemed very nice, and that he wanted a complete explanation even more because he
 had previously thought about this but had not been able to obtain a clear solution,
 "eoque magis absolutam hac de re explanationem videre cuperem, quod ego quoque

 The Möbius function ji (n) is defined to be: 0 if л has a repeated prime factor (i.e. n has

 a square factor), 1 if n is 1, and (- l)m if n is the product of m distinct prime factors.
 In his Introductio in analysin infinitorum (Euler 1748, Caput XV, §277), E101, Euler
 notes that

 so this is the series expansion of the reciprocal of (1). Sandifer (2007b, Chap. 32)
 explains E72.

 ditam solutionem, qualem desideraveram, pertingere potui" ["and I would like to see

 a complete explanation on this point, all the more because I too have encountered the

 same problems, but have not been able to come upon a solution as sufficiently neat
 and easy as I had wanted"].

 Then Euler explains his method of finding f (2 n), and looks at expressions for the

 cotangent series. After this Euler deals with partitions of integers. First, if the infinite

 product (1 + nx)(' +n2x)( 1 + n3x)( 1 + /i4jc)( 1 + n5x) etc. is multiplied out ("quodsi
 enim hi factores actu in se invicem multiplicentur" ["if these factors are actually mul-
 tiplied into each other"]) then in the resulting series, the coefficient of xln3 will be

 the number of ways in which j can be written as a sum of i distinct positive integers,

 disregarding order. For example, in the series of terms multiplying jc2, the coefficient

 of n} indicates the number of ways j can be written as a sum of two distinct positive

 integers. In the series multiplying x 3, the coefficient of shows the number of ways
 j can be written as a sum of three distinct positive integers, and so on.

 It is also apparent that the series by which x is multiplied arises if n is divided

 by 1 - n' next the series of xx arises from the division of n? by (1 - n){ 1 - nn );

 third, the series of *3 is the quotient arising from the division of the power n 6
 by (1 - n)(l - n2)( 1 - л3), and so on.1

 Letting ( A)^ denote the number of ways A can be written as a sum of p unequal parts,
 Euler says "Deinceps etiam ad series sequentes ex antecedentibus eruendas inveni hanc

 regulam" ["I have also found this rule for working out the following series from the
 preceding"], namely (A)(p) = (A - p){p) + (A - p)(p~{), where if A < P(P+l) then
 (A)(^ = 0.

 Euler then looks at partitions into parts that are not necessarily distinct. The infinite

 "per continuam divisionem evolvatur" ["expanded by repeated division"] gives the
 series where the coefficient of x'n 7 indicates the number of ways j can be written
 as a sum of i positive integers. Letting (A)(p) now be the number of ways to write
 Л as a sum of p positive integers, not necessarily distinct, Euler also observes that
 (A)(p) = (A - PÝP) + (A - l)^"1*.

 For x = 1 the second infinite product is the generating function for the partition

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 309

 where we define p{ 0) = 1.

 Previously, generating functions had been used by Pierre Rémond de Montmort

 (1678-1719) in his Essay d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard (1708), Abraham de Moi-
 vre (1667-1754) in his The doctrine of chances (1718, first ed.), and Jacob I Bernoulli

 in his Ars Conjectandi (1713). The publication history of the Ars Conjectandi van
 der Waerden and Kohli (van der Waerden 1975, K. 3, pp. 391-401). Cantor (1901,
 Kapitel 96) summarizes earlier work on combinatorics and generating functions. How-

 ever, it seems that Euler came up with the idea of generating functions independently
 (Scharlau 1983, §4).

 3 Discovery and Proof

 The first time the pentagonal number theorem is mentioned in Euler's published corre-

 spondence is in a letter from Daniel Bernoulli to Euler on January 28, 1741 , R. 140. In

 this letter, Bernoulli discusses a number of problems that Euler seems to have proposed

 in a letter on November 30, 1740 which is not extant (cf. Rudio 1915, p. xviii, footnote

 3 and Eneström 1906). In particular, Bernoulli mentions the problem of finding all the

 partitions of an integer:

 The problem about combinations of numbers making a given sum is quite easy
 in particular cases: but it turns out that one cannot perceive the general rule,

 although one can still indicate the general method. I have not done the calculation

 for your example of dividing the number 50 into 7 parts, but I gave it to my cousin

 Nicolaus Bernoulli, who found exactly the number that Your Honour worked out.

 The other problem, to transform the expression (l - £) ^1 - ^ ^1 - ^ into

 the series 1 - - - y -b 4r + Л

 n nl y n* n1 nlz nn ts J J

 induction, when one actually multiplies many factors of the given expression.2

 It looks like Bernoulli is saying that we cannot hope to find a general formula for

 partitions because of all the particular cases that arise, but we can at least get a general
 understanding of how partitions work and maybe find rules to make computations
 simpler. Here a "regula generalis" ["general rule"] would be something like a formula

 to give the number of partitions of a number /2, while a "methodus generalis" ["gen-
 eral method"] would be an algorithm for calculating the number of partitions of n.
 An analogy might be how we would not expect to be able to find a simple formula
 (namely a rule) for the nth prime number (cf. Hardy and Wright 1980, §§2.7, 22.3),

 although, we can find the nth prime just by checking numbers one by one, and indeed

 Daniel Bernoulli was a close colleague to Euler at the St. Petersburg Academy

 from 1727 to 1733. Bernoulli came to St. Petersburg in 1725, and Euler came in 1727.
 Daniel Bernoulli was interested in recurrent series and wrote several papers about
 them (Gillispie 1980, Volume II, "Daniel Bernoulli", pp. 36-46; cf. Hofmann 1959,
 §11). Euler's correspondence with Daniel Bernoulli's cousin Nicolaus I Bernoulli on

 the pentagonal number theorem is summarized later in this section.

 Euler states without proof on p. 51 of his Fourth Notebook, "Haec expressio (1 -

 n)( 1 - n2)( 1 - n3)(l - n4){ 1 - n 5) etc. transmutatur in hanc seriem:

 l-n-n2 + n5+n7-n12-n15 + n22 + n26 - л35 - n40 + etc.

 л3)( 1 - n4)( 1 - n 5) etc. transforms into this series:

 l-n-n2 + n5+n7-nI2-n15+ n22 + n 26 - n35 - n40 + etc.

 whose exponents are contained in the form 3xx^x ."]

 Euler's Fourth Notebook covers the period 1740-1744, and Euler's Fifth Notebook,
 titled "Diarium mathematicum", covers 1749-1753 (Mikhajlov 1959, §Ш). It seems

 that Euler had one notebook covering the years 1745-1749 that was not kept.

 The first paper in which Euler mentions the pentagonal number theorem is his

 "Observationes analyticae variae de combinationibus", presented to the St. Petersburg
 Academy on April 6, 1741 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 256) and published in 1751 in the
 Commentarii (Euler 1751b), E158. In this article, Euler first develops some general
 results about infinite series and products. Generally, Euler is working out a lot of rela-

 tions between different infinite series and products that are symmetric in the (infinitely

 many) variables a, b, c, d , e , etc.

 Then in section §§17-37 of the paper Euler talks about partitions, applying the

 general results from the first part of the paper with a = n,b = n2, с = я3, etc.
 This lets us group lots of terms together as geometric series. For example, instead of
 ab + ас -I- ad + ae + bd + etc. we now have First, Euler proves results

 about partitions of m into д distinct parts and partitions of m into ¡x not necessarily
 distinct parts, which he denotes by and m ^ respectively. In §22, Euler starts
 to look at how the denominator of expands from a product into a

 k(k+ 1)/2

 sum, for example (,_n)ť,_"n6;)(|_n3) = t_n_nlfni+ni_n6. In §27, he proves the recur-
 rence relation = (m + д)(д)| - /n(/i)ť and in §34, the recurrence relation
 = (m - д)(м) + (m - 1)(д_1), which as we noted in §2 he had already stated

 in his 1740 letter to Naudé. In §36 of the paper, Euler states that he has found an

 interesting result that he has not been able to prove with complete rigor:

 There is a noteworthy observation to make at the end of this article, which how-

 ever I have not been able to prove with geometric rigor. Namely I have observed

 that this product of infinitely many factors

 (1 - n)( 1 - n2)( 1 - n3)( 1 - n4)( 1 - n 5) etc.

 In §37 of the paper, Euler notes as well that the product of the power series on the

 right-hand side of (2) and the above power series is unity, since they are the series
 expansions of reciprocal infinite products. We talk about Euler's recurrence relation
 for p(n) more in §5.

 This article was reviewed in the June 1755 Nova acta eruditorum (pp. 361-363),

 An observation is made at the conclusion of this paper which, though the Author

 has not yet been able to demonstrate it with geometric rigor, is still noteworthy.
 For with the terms

 n that occur are those whose exponents are contained in the form 3x . Also,

 if x is an odd number, the powers n ~~т~~ would have the coefficient - 1 , while

 truly if x is an even number, the coefficient will be -t-1.4

 Sandifer (2007b, Chap. 48) gives a step by step explanation of El 58.

 El 58 was the last paper Euler presented to the St. Petersburg Academy before he

 went to Berlin. He left St. Petersburg on June 19, 1741, and arrived Berlin on July 25
 (Gillispie 1980, Volume IV, "Leonhard Euler", pp. 467-484).

 The next time the expansion of the infinite product 1 ~х") into a series comes

 up in Euler's correspondence is in a letter from Euler to Nicolaus I Bernoulli ( 1 687-
 1759) on September 1, 1742 (Fellmann and Mikhajlov 1998, pp. 510-532). Euler

 discusses the problem of expressing the power series for sin 5, s - ^ - etc.

 as the infinite product s ^1 - ^1 - etc. in this letter. Euler tells
 Bernoulli the generating function for the partition function, and that,

 This series also arises from division, if unity is divided by

 (1 - n)( 1 - n2){ 1 - n3)( 1 - nA){ 1 - n5) etc.;

 this product, if actually expanded, gives this expression

 1 - n - n2 + n5 + n1 - nn - и 15 -h n22 + n26 - n35 - etc.

 in which I have not been able to observe from the nature of the series how the

 exponents proceed, although by induction I have concluded that no other expo-
 nents occur except those contained in the formula 3xx±x ; and that a power of n

 has the + sign if its exponent arises from an even number substituted for x.5

 truth indeed appears by examination, though with difficulty. In truth I am only able to

 furnish a demonstration by differentiation and integration"].

 Nicolaus I Bernoulli replies to Euler on October 24, 1 742 (Fellmann and Mikhajlov
 1998, pp. 532-550). Bernoulli says that Euler's discovery of the generating function

 n£Li yzpr for p{n) is an elegant result. Then Bernoulli works out a "novam speciem
 trianguli arithmetici" ["new type of arithmetic triangle"] for recursively calculating

 partitions. He works out two triangles. In the first, the kth entry in the rth row (ending

 in the Roman numeral r ) counting from right to left is equal to the number of partitions

 of r in which the largest part occurs exactly к times; however, the way Bernoulli writes

 the triangle, this breaks down in the (|_§J + l)th entry in each row, i.e., the left-most
 nonzero entry in each row. Bernoulli puts 1 in each of these spots, while there are in

 fact 0 partitions of r with the largest part occurring exactly |_§J + 1 times. However,
 the way Bernoulli uses the triangle, these 1 's could in fact be put at the left end of the

 row instead of in the (|_§J + l)th entry of the row. For each partition of r + 1 with
 largest part occurring exactly once, removing 1 from the largest part yields a partition
 of r; and on the other hand, adding 1 to the largest part of a partition of r yields a

 partition of r + 1 with largest part occurring exactly once. Hence the 1 st entry in the
 rth row is p(r - 1). Bernoulli spells out what the entries are in row IX, r = 9. There

 are 22 partitions of 9 in which the largest part occurs exactly once, 4 in which it occurs

 exactly twice, 2 in which it occurs exactly three times, and so on. Bernoulli explains

 how the entries in the triangle can be recursively calculated, which amounts to there

 being as many partitions of r with the largest part occurring exactly к times as there are

 partitions of г - к with the largest part occurring at least к times. It is straightforward

 to show this using the Ferrers diagram (Andrews 1998, §1.3) for partitions. In each

 partition of r with the largest part occurring exactly к times, subtract 1 from each of
 the к largest parts. Then there is a partition of r - к with the largest part occurring

 at least к times. For example, there are 14 partitions of 13 with largest part occurring

 exactly twice (here r = 13 and к = 2), and there are 8 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 partitions of
 11 = 13 - 2 with largest part occurring at least twice.

 In the second triangle, the entry in column r (beneath the Roman numeral r) and
 row j counting downwards starting at row 7=0 represents the number of partitions

 of r with largest part equal to j . For example, for XII, r = 1 2, 1 3 is the entry for j = 5,

 in other words there are 1 3 partitions of 1 2 with largest part equal to 5. Let (j , r ) be the

 entry in row j and column r, so (5, 12) = 13. The entries are calculated recursively as
 follows: the entry in (7, r) is equal to the sum of all the entries ( к , r - 7), 0 < к < j.
 For r = 12, j = 5, the entry (5, 12) = 13 is equal to the sum of all the entries ( к , 7),
 0 < к < 5, which is (0, 7)+(l, 7)+(2, 7)+(3, 7)+(4, 7)+(5, 7) =0+1+3+4+3+2.
 For, adding the part j to a partition of r - j with largest part no greater than j yields

 a partition of r with largest part j.

 Bernoulli goes on to mention the pentagonal number theorem,

 In this series

 n° - nx - n2 + n5 + n1 - nn - nX5 + n22 + n 26 - n 35 - etc.

 which you have found equal to the expanded product (1 -n)( 1 -nn)( 1 - n3) etc.
 the differences of the exponents progress as 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, etc. which

 numbers are alternately drawn from the series 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. and from the
 series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. This property will perhaps be able to be demonstrated

 from the nature of the matter and not only by induction; but I do not have time
 at the moment to look into this matter.6

 it

 Then Bernoulli talks about the series s = Xju=o БГ+Т» writing "Valde mihi placet
 methodus inveniendi et summandi series per differentiationem et integrationem, eam-

 que ulterius extendi posse existimo" ["I find very pleasant this method for finding and

 summing series by differentiation and integration, and I believe that it can be further
 extended"]. Bernoulli works out s 2 and s3.

 In fact one can easily derive Euler's statement that the general term is of the form

 2 fr°m Bernoulli's statement about the differences of the terms. From the theory
 of finite differences (Chrystal 1964, Chap. XXXI, §§1-5), if ao» яь ... is an arithmetic

 progression of order n then

 ak = ^(k'AJa0.
 j= о v//

 Let со = 0, c' = 1 , C2 = 2, C3 = 5, с 4 = 7, es = 12, = 15, c-j = 22, c% =
 26, C9 = 35, etc., and let ak = C2k and bk = С2*+ь so ao = 0, a' = 2, Я2 = l,a$ =
 15, «4 = 26, etc. and b0 = l,bj = 5,¿>2 = 12, ¿>3 = 22, ¿74 = 35, etc. Bernoulli has
 observed that bk - я* = 2k + 1 and ak - bk- 1 = k. Hence, bk - bk-' - 3k + 1 and

 я*+1~я* = Зк+2. Here, A%) = 0, Дяо = 2, Д2яо = 3,so ak = 0+2 к+к^1^3 =

 On the other hand, A°bo = 1 , AZ?o = 4, A2bo = 3, so bk = 1 + 4k + 3*2^~3* ,

 thus bk- 1 = Ък2^к •

 But it can be useful to formulate a problem in different ways. As we mentioned
 above, Nicolaus I Bernoulli also had some good ideas about making a "triangle" for
 finding recurrence relations for partitions.

 Euler next writes to Nicolaus I Bernoulli on November 10, 1742 (Fellmann and

 Mikhajlov 1998, pp. 551-579), the last letter in their correspondence that deals with
 the pentagonal number theorem. Euler tells Bernoulli how pleased he was with the
 ideas Bernoulli communicated about partitio numerorum, "Plurimum autem me delec-

 tarunt, quae de partitione numerorum (sic enim appellabat hunc problema Clar. Nau-
 daeus, qui id mihi primům jam Petropoli proposuerat) mecum communicare voluisti"

 ["What you were gracious enough to communicate to me about partitio numerorum

 when I was in St. Petersburg) was a great pleasure to me"]. Then Euler explains to

 Bernoulli in more detail his approach to finding the number of partitions of a given

 number N into n distinct parts, and the number of partitions of a given number N into

 n parts which are not necessarily distinct. For the first problem Euler explains that if

 the product

 of m can be distributed into as many unequal parts as the exponent of z."] That is, the

 sum of all the coefficients of the mNzn terms is equal to the number of partitions of N
 into n distinct parts. Letting (1 +mz)( 1 +m2z)( 1 + m3z)(l +m4z) etc. = 1 +<xz +

 Euler explains similarly that when we expand

 (1 - mz)( 1 - m2z)( 1 - m3z)(l - mAz) etc.

 into a series, "coefficiens cujusque termini indicat quot variis modis exponens ipsius m

 dispertiri possit in tot partes quot exponens ipsius z continet unitates" ["the coefficient

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 317

 It turns out that Euler does not use the device of differentiation and integration in his

 proofs of the pentagonal number theorem. However, Euler does use these methods
 to find his recurrence relation for sums of divisors, which we talk about in §4 of this

 article. Euler's work on the theorems that every nonnegative integer is a sum of four

 squares, that every prime of the form 4n + 1 is a sum of two squares, and that a sum
 of two cubes cannot be a cube is explained by Weil (1984, Chap. III).

 The next time Euler discusses the pentagonal number theorem in his correspon-
 dence is in a letter to Christian Goldbach ( 1 690-1 764) on October 4/15,1 743 (Juškevič

 and Winter 1965, Brief 74). Euler states here,

 When these factors (1 - n)( 1 - n2)( 1 - n3)( 1 - nA){ 1 - n5)( 1 - n 6) etc. are

 actually multiplied with each other out to infinity, the following series comes out

 1 - nx - n2 + n5 + n1 - я 12 - л 15 + n 22 + n 26 - n35 - n40

 +n5i + n57 - etc.,

 from which it is apparent by induction that all the terms are contained in the form

 n , and that they have the prefixed sign + when x is an even number, but the

 sign - when x is an odd number. But I have still not been able to find a method by
 which I could demonstrate the identity of these two expressions. Prof. Nicolaus

 Bernoulli also has not been able to get anything out of it except by induction.8

 Goldbach replies to Euler's problem in a letter dated December 1743 (Juškevič

 and Winter 1965, Brief 75). His copybook has been checked and we now know that
 the letter was written December 14; Goldbach kept correspondence books in which

 he entered complete or partial copies of the letters he sent to various correspondents.

 He does not give any explicit ideas for how to tackle proving the pentagonal number
 theorem, and instead poses a new related problem. He says,

 Footnote 7 continued

 A particular problem has occurred to me concerning the series ( 1 - n) ( 1 - n2) ( 1 -

 n 3) etc.: given a series A of infinitely many terms proceeding with the signs +

 and - varying in a given order, to find a series В of such a nature that in the prod-

 uct AB, the signs + and - proceed in the same order as they were proceeding in
 A. This problem can very easily be solved in the case A = (1 - n)( 1 - n2)( 1 -
 n3) etc., for although Your Honour has noted that the signs +, - alternate in a

 quite unusual way, when I put ß = ^1 - n2^ ^1 - ni^i_ etc., thus A
 multiplied by В becomes a new series, which itself has the same variation of
 signs.9

 318 J.Bell

 Probably what Goldbach means by "die signa +,- auf eine gar ungewöhnliche Art
 abwechseln" ["the signs +, - alternate in a quite unusual way" ] is the following.
 When we expand the product IX^Li 0 - xn) into a power series anXn, a rule
 for the coefficients ("signa", since an = - 1, 0 or 1) an is not obvious like a geo-

 metric series. It looks like Goldbach did not have any ideas himself how to prove the

 pentagonal number theorem, but wanted to pose a related question that might inspire
 Euler.

 Euler writes back to Goldbach about this on January 10/21, 1744 (Juškevič and

 Winter 1965, Brief 76), in which he says,

 Your Honour's reflection on the expression (1 - n)( 1 - n2)( 1 - n 3) etc. with

 respect to the product ^1 - л 2 ^ ^1 - л 2 ^ ^1 - л 2 ^ etc. that this product when
 expanded gives the same variation of signs, could perhaps be put to some use in

 other investigations; but so far I haven't been able to make any use of it in the
 series which I have derived.10

 On March 25/April 5, 1746, Euler writes another letter to Goldbach about the pen-

 tagonal number theorem (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 102). In this letter, he gives
 some expansions of products. First, he lets

 s = (1+ e)(l + a2)( 1 + a4) ■ • • (1+ a2").

 ои+l 2W"^ i

 wann ich setze В = o-oo-oo - n 2 ^ etc., so wird A multiplicata per В eine neue series,
 welche dieselbe variationem signorům in sich hält." (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 75).

 Serie, welche ich daraus hergeleitet, habe ich daraus noch keinen Nutzen ziehen können." (Juškevič and
 Winter 1965, Brief 76).

 But (1 - a)s = 1 - a2 ои+l , and hence s = a a_¡ i . However, there is not an obvious

 simple expression for the product (1 - a)( 1 - a2)(l - aA) • • • (1 - a2"), and indeed

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 319

 Euler remarks that actual multiplication of the first factors of the product gives

 J- a_ fl2+a3- a4 + a5+a6_a7_a8+a9 + a10_al.+a12_a.3_al4

 +a15_a16+a.7etc

 Euler then says,

 "wo die ordo signorům merkwürdig ist" ["where the order of the signs is remarkable"].

 I believe that I have already also written to Your Honour that when this infinite
 product (1 - a)( 1 - a2)( 1 - a3)( 1 - a4)( 1 - a5) etc. is expanded, this series
 1 - a - a2 + a5 + a7 - ax2 - a15 H -a22 + a26 - a 35 - a40 -bete, results, where

 the sequence of the exponents is very remarkable, and it can be determined by

 induction that everything is contained in the formula Ъхх^х , although I have not
 been able to derive this observed law from the nature of the matter. 1 1

 Euler is saying that he has found a pattern when he actually works out particular
 cases, but that he has not so far been able to understand why this pattern would work

 in general. However, he has some sense that a proof would be similar to how he ver-
 ifies the individual cases. For, when the partial products (1 - x) • • • (1 - xN) and
 (1 - x) • • • (1 - jc^1) are expanded as sums, they will have the same coefficients
 at least for all powers <N, since all the terms in - jc^4"1 (1 - x) • • • (1 - xN) will
 have exponents >N + I. Thus to find the coefficients of the powers <N in the series
 expansion of the infinite product (1 - x)(' - x2) • • -, we need to expand at most the

 first N factors. Still, in effect this means that he has only been able to guess the pattern,

 and has not found a proof.

 In a letter to Euler on April 15, 1747 (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 1 14), Gold-
 bach responds to Euler's previous letter, which had given a recurrence relation for
 the divisor function (see §4 of this article). In that letter, Euler had remarked that his

 proof assumes the pentagonal number theorem, which he had not been able to prove
 rigorously. Goldbach declares that,

 the observation which Your Honour has communicated to me seems to me by

 means of the aforementioned induction already shown to the extent that one
 could bet on its truth one hundred to one. Otherwise, Your Honour already
 observed awhile ago that A ... (1 - x)(' - x2)(l - *3)(1 - x4) etc. = В . . . 1 -
 x - x2 -i- x5 -h x1 - x12 - xX5 + etc. and I remember that I derived from it

 the very simple consequence that, when the powers of x are doubled in В and
 put as С = 1 - x2 - x4 + xxo + xX4 - xx2 - x30 + etc., then it must be
 £ = (1 - jc)(1 - лг3) ( 1 - *5)(1 - x1) etc.12

 1 1 "Ew. Hochwohlgeb. glaube ich auch schon geschrieben zu haben, daß wann man dieses produetum

 In his previous letter to Goldbach, supposing the pentagonal number theorem Euler
 proved a recurrence relation for the sum of divisors function or(n). But Euler said

 he could not find a rigorous proof of the pentagonal number theorem, which left this

 recurrence relation hanging. Goldbach seems to say that Euler gave a pretty good argu-

 ment a few years ago; yet, Euler would like a more rigorous proof. Also, it is in fact

 ^ = (1 - *)(1 - jc3)(1 - jc5)(1 - jc7) etc., not § = (1 - *)(1 - jc3)(1 - jc5)(1 - jc7) etc.
 like Goldbach says here.

 Euler replies to Goldbach on May 6, 1747 (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 115),

 saying:

 The remark which Your Honour made about the equality A . . . (1- jc)(1- jc2)(1 -
 jc3)(1 -jc4)etc. = В ... 1 -X - X2 + jc5 + X7 - etc., that, if С = '-x2-x4 +

 *10 + jc14 - jc24 - jc30 +etc. then it would be ^ = (1 - jc)(1 - jc3)( 1 - x5) etc.,
 I still remember well. But neither from this nor from other approaches have I
 been able to properly demonstrate the equality between the formulas A and B'

 for that A = В and that in В the exponents of x just come out according to the

 series 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 22, 26, 35, 40, 1 have shown only by induction, which I

 have in fact continued so far that I can hold the theorem as a complete truth; I

 would however be very eager to see a direct demonstration of it, which certainly

 would open the way to the discovery of many other marvelous properties of the

 integers: but so far all my efforts towards this have been in vain.13

 Then Euler gives some results about representing numbers as sums of squares.

 As we remarked about the above letter, it is ^ = (1 - jc)(1 - jc3)(1 - jc5) etc. not

 § = (1 - *)( 1 - *3)( 1 - x5) etc.; photographs of the original letters have been checked
 and indeed Goldbach and Euler both make this slip of the pen. Possibly Goldbach made
 this slip because he uses A and В differently here than in his December 1743 letter

 (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 75), which has already been quoted above. There A
 is a product over the even powers of nx!2 and В is a product over the odd powers of

 л1/2, and thus AB is a product over all powers of л1/2, while here A = В is a product

 over all powers of x and С is a product over the even powers of jc, and thus ^ is a
 product over all the odd powers of jc.

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 321

 Later, in a letter to Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783) on December 30, 1747
 (Juškevič and Taton 1980, Euler-d' Alembert, Lettre No. 11), Euler writes that he has

 learned from Maupertuis (the President of the Berlin Academy) that d'Alembert wants

 to leave his mathematical research for some time to regain his health. Euler approves

 this idea, and goes on to say,

 If in your respite you have the desire to do some research that is not too demand-
 ing, let me take the liberty of proposing to you this expression (1 - x)(' -
 x2)(' - jc3)(1 - ;t4)(l - jc5)(1 - X6) etc., which, when expanded by actual
 multiplication, gives this series

 1 - xl - X2 + X5 + X1 - XX1 - XiS -hx22 + X26 - X35 - X40 +Jt51 +JC57

 -X10 - X11 + etc.

 which seems quite remarkable to me because of the pattern that one easily discov-

 ers; but I do not see how this law could be deduced from the proposed expression

 otherwise than by induction.14

 As a postscript Euler says15

 If we let s = (1 - jc)(1 - x2)(' - jc3)( 1 - x4)(' - x5)(l - x6) etc. then I can

 D'Alembert may have been fatigued because of his work on the three-body prob-

 11, Note 1). Euler probably thought that this might catch ďAlemberťs interest. Euler

 was looking for people to talk to about number theory in general (see Scriba 1 984, §4).

 D'Alembert replies to Euler in a letter on January 20, 1748 (Juškevič and Taton

 1980, Euler-ď Alembert, Lettre No. 12). He begins by saying that by taking a break

 from work his health is presently much better. He says, "à l'égard de la suite dont vous

 me parlés elle est fort singulière, j'y ay un peu pensé, mais je ne vois que l'induction
 pour la demontrer" ["with regard to the series which you wrote me about, it is most

 singular, and I've given it some thought, but I don't see anything other than induction

 for a proof'].

 In §323 (in Chapter XVI, "De partitione numerorum") of the Introductio in anal-

 ysin infinitorum (Euler 1748), E101, published in 1748, Euler states the pentagonal
 number theorem, and observes the fact that the product (1 - jc)(1 - x2)(l - jc3) etc. is

 the reciprocal of the generating function for p(n). Then in §324, he states a recurrence
 relation for р(я),16

 Therefore because of the recursion pattern

 s = п. In particular, if a = 10 then s interpolates the common logarithm of x.
 For x = 9 and a = 10 he calculates the first 11 terms of the series to get s =

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 323

 Euler proves several results about series and infinite products in his paper "Con-

 sideratio quarumdam serierum, quae singularibus proprietatibus sunt praeditae", E 190,

 read at the June 19, 1749 meeting of the Berlin Academy (Winter 1957, Nr. 134), sent
 to Johann Daniel Schumacher (1690-1761) on December 18/29, 1749 (Juškevič and

 Winter 1961, Brief 108), presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on January 26,
 1750 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 369), and published in the Novi Commentarii in 1753 (Euler
 1753a; cf. Knobloch 1984, III, Nr. 168). Schumacher was the administrator of the St.

 Petersburg Academy.

 In this article Euler looks at a series that interpolates 'oga . Euler defines the series

 Next in §§8-11, Euler takes x - and looks for different ways to express 5 for

 n = 1, 2, .... In particular, he writes В for the series s with x = £ and says that for
 a = 10,

 В = -0.109989900001001;

 of course log10(^j) = -1, and so 5 does not interpolate logö at negative integer
 powers of a.

 In §10 Euler defines u(x) = s(a2x) and with some simple manipulations gets
 и = 2t - s + ax(' + s - t). In §1 1 he states the following lemma, which is useful
 when working with infinite products17:

 Then in §14 Euler says he wants to express the series л; as a power series in x :

 At last in a letter from Euler to Goldbach on June 9, 1750 (Juškevič and Winter

 1965, Brief 144), Euler gives a proof of the pentagonal number theorem. This proof is

 based on the lemma (4), which expands an infinite product into a series of products.
 We can write this lemma as

 But since then I have also found the demonstration of this theorem, which is
 based on this lemma: (1 - a)(l - ß)(' - y)( 1 - 8) etc. = 1 - a - ß(' -
 a) - y( 1 - a)(l - ß) - 5(1 - a)(l - ß)(l - y) - etc., whose demonstration
 is immediately evident.

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 327

 We will give an explicit proof by induction. Trivially 1 - a' = 1 - a' . Assume up

 to some N that

 N N

 П = 1 /î = l

 N N+ 1

 If we subtract ан+' (1 - a') • • • (1 - an) from both sides we get

 f]d -a„) = '- £>„( 1 - a,) • • • (1 - a„-').

 But the left-hand side is precisely

 N N N+ 1

 «=1 n=' n- 1

 f](l -a„)-aN+' f](l -an)= [](1 "««)•

 Thus the claim holds for + 1 . Then letting N -> oo implies (5).

 Euler is referring in the above to his March 21 /April 1, 1747 letter to Goldbach,

 where he found the recurrence relation for a(n) assuming the pentagonal number

 theorem. Now Euler says that since that time he has found a proof of the pentago-
 nal number theorem that satisfies him. Euler then gives a proof by induction of the

 pentagonal number theorem using (5), taking an - xn for all n.

 Euler does the following. Let s = 1 - x - Ax2, where A = 1 - * + *(1 - *)(1 -

 X2) + jc2(1 - *)(1 - Jt2)(l - Jt3) + etc. Then distributing the factor 1 - x in each

 term we get

 A= i-x -x2(l - x2) -x3(' - x2){' - x3) -etc.

 + x(l - x2) +x2(' - Jt2)(l - x3) +x3(' - x2)(' - x3)(' - x4) -I- etc.

 Then combining the pairs of terms,

 A = 1 - x3 - x5(' - x2) - jc7(1 - *2)(1 - x3) - etc.

 Euler does not explicitly do the induction step. Instead he works out enough steps to
 make it clear how we could do the induction step.

 Now let A = 1 - jc3 - Bx5, and

 В = I - x2 + x2{' - JC2)(1 - x3) + JC4(1 - *2)(1 - л3)(1 - *4) + etc.

 Then expanding the factor 1 - x2,

 B = 1-х2 -*4(1-jc3) -x6(l - *3)(1 - jc4) -etc.

 +x2(l -x3) +JC4(1 - JC3)(1 -X4) +*6(1 - JC3)(1 - JC4)(1 - л:5) H- etc.

 Again the pairs of terms are combined, which gives

 В = 1 - X5 - *8(1 - *3) - Jcn(l - *3)(1 - X4) - etc.

 Next let В = 1 - x5 - Cjc8, and so on. Euler explicitly works out this case, then

 It will thus be

 s = 1 - x - Ax 2 s = 1 - x - Ax2
 A = 1 - x3 - Bx5 Ax2 = jc2(1 - jc3) - Bx7
 В = Ì - x5 - Cx8 or Bx7 =x7(l -x5)-Cx15
 С = 1 - x7 - D xu С; с15 = jc15(l - x7)- Dx26
 D= 1-х9 - Ex 14 Dx26 = Jt26(l - jc9) - Ex 40

 etc. etc.

 from which it follows with no doubt at all that

 s = 1-х - jc2(l - jc3) + jc7(1 - jc5) - jc ,5(1 - jc7) +jc26(1 - jc9) - etc., or

 s = 1 - jc - jc2 + jc5 + jc7 - jc12 - jc15 + jc22 + jc26 - jc35 - etc.

 Let us now explicitly work out the induction in Euleťs above proof of the pentagonal

 number theorem. Let

 so (7) holds for all N > 1, thus proving the pentagonal number theorem.

 In his "Demonstratio theorematis circa ordinem in summis divisorům observatum",

 published in the Novi Commentarii in 1760 (Euler 1760a), E244 (cf. Knobloch 1984,

 I, Nr. 43), Euler gives the above proof of the pentagonal number theorem from his

 letter to Goldbach with a bit more detail. Schumacher acknowledges in his April 4/15,

 1752 letter to Euler (Juškevič and Winter 1961, Brief 189) having received the paper

 with Euler's March 7/18, 1752 letter (Juškevič and Winter 1961, Brief 185), though
 the paper is not mentioned in that letter. In this article Euler first recalls that some

 time ago he had discovered a recurrence relation for the divisor function, for which

 the differences in the arguments are the pentagonal numbers. However, his proof was

 not rigorous enough to him, since it relied on the pentagonal number theorem, which

 previously he had not been able to find a rigorous proof for. But now he declares that

 he has finally found a demonstration of the pentagonal number theorem. Proposition
 1 is our (5), for a' = -a, 02 = - яз = -у and so on. His demonstration is the
 following,20

 330 J. Bell

 Atque sic in infinitum procedendo summa totius seriei seu omnium eius terminorum perducetur ad hoc

 For since the first term is (1 + a) and the second = ß(' -h a), the sum of the
 first and second will be = (1 +a)(l + ß); now if the third term y(l+a)('+ß)
 is added it will yield (1 + a)(l + ß){' + y); let the fourth term, which is

 ^ "Cum enim seriei prímus terminus sit (1 + a) et secundus = ß{' + a), erit summa primi et secundi

 5(1 + a)(l + ß)(' + y), be added on top; the sum will be

 = (l+a)(l+0)(l+y)(l+Ä).

 And proceeding thus onto infinity, the whole of the series, or all of its terms, will

 be led to this product

 (1 + a)(l + ¿0(1 + y)(l + S) (1 + 0(1 + ?) etc.

 Whence it is clear that if

 it will be in turn

 j = (1 + a)(l + ß)(l + к)(1 + (5)(1 + €)(1 + Ç) etc.

 5 = (1 + a) + ß{' + a) + y( 1 + a)(l + ß) + ¿(1 + a)(l + ß){' + y) + etc.

 Euler uses this to prove the pentagonal number theorem. In Proposition 2 he takes
 a = - x,ß = - X 2, y = -X 3,<5 = - jc4,€ = -X5, etc. Then s = (1 - Jt)(l - x2)(l -
 jc3)(1 - jc4)(1 - jc5)(1 - X6) etc., and

 s = 1 - X - x2(l - x) - Jt3(l - Jt)(l - X2) - jc4(1 - jc)0 - x2){' - X 3) - etc.

 Then in Proposition 3, Euler proves the pentagonal number theorem. It is the same

 proof he gave in his above letter to Goldbach, but he gives a bit more detail. He
 concludes,

 Therefore, we will have

 s = 1 - x - x2{' - *3) + *7(1 - jc5) - xl5(l - x1) + Jt26(l - x9)

 or that very thing which is to be demonstrated,

 from which the law of the exponents indicated above is clearly seen at once.21

 Euler then uses the pentagonal number theorem to finally give a rigorous proof of

 his recurrence relation for the divisor function, which we discuss in §4.

 In the 1752 Bibliothèque impartiale (juillet et août), tome VI, première partie, arti-

 cle IX, "Demonstration de la Loi d'une suite de termes de la Quantité composée qui
 est faite par la multiplication des Binômes 1 - jc, 1 - jc2, 1 - jc3, & c.", pp. 1 1 1-126,

 there is a proof of the pentagonal number theorem by an anonymous author.

 Euler leaves Berlin on June 9, 1766, spends ten days in Warsaw, and arrives in St.

 Petersburg on July 28. By 1771, he was completely blind (Gillispie 1980, Volume IV,
 "Leonhard Euler", pp. 467-484).

 Euler gives two proofs of the pentagonal number theorem in his later paper "Evo-

 lutio producti infiniti (1 - x)(' - jcjc)(1 - лг3)(1 - jc4)( 1 - jc5)(1 - Xе) etc. in seriem
 simplicem", delivered to the St. Petersburg Academy on August 14, 1775 (Nevskaja
 2000, p. 627) and published in 1783 in the Acta (Euler 1783b), E541. The first proof
 is a reworking of the proof in E244, while the second is a little different. We will
 explicitly work out the inductions in both of them. Euler takes

 5 = (1 - x)(l - x2)(' - jc3)(1 - X4) etc.

 and "facile patet fore" ["it is not difficult to see that"]

 s = ' - X - x2(l - x) - Af3(l - jc)(1 - X2) - jc4(1 - jc)(1 - jc2)(1 - X 3) - etc.

 and "quaeritur, si singuli eius termini evolvantur, qualis series secundum simplices
 potestates ipsius x sit proditura" ["we want to find what series will be produced in
 simple powers of x if all the terms are expanded"].

 In the first proof (§§1-10 of E541), let

 A = ^V+I(1 -х2)---0-хп)-^хп+2(' -x2)---(l-xn).

 A = x2 + ^xn+2( 1 x2} • • • (1 - x2) • • • (1 -x"),

 for all N > 1 . Since S' = A and s = 1 - x - A this is true for N = 1 . If we assume it

 is true for some N > l9 using (8) it follows right away that it is true for N + 1, which

 proves the pentagonal number theorem.

 This proof is essentially the same as the proof from E244. However, it indeed ends

 up being simpler to pack everything into S n and prove (8), since the pentagonal num-
 ber theorem follows almost immediately from this, while in E244 we have to show
 (6) and then show (7).

 Euler had written down this proof on p. 100 of his Fifth Notebook; his unpublished

 proof of the pentagonal number theorem is on pp. 97-99 of his Fifth Notebook, and
 we shall describe that proof in this section after we finish discussing E541. In this
 proof he takes s = (1 - jc)(1 - x2)(' - jc3) ( 1 - Jt4) etc. and expands this product
 as s = 1 - x - x2(l - Jt) - x3(l - x)(l - x1) - дс4(1 - x)(l - x2)(l - x3) - etc.
 Euler works out the steps s = 1 - x - A, A = x2 - x5 - В, В = x1 - xn - C,
 С = x 15 - x22 - D and D = x26 - x35 - E of the above proof, and then writes down

 (9) corresponds to verifying (8). In Euler's published papers he makes clear how the
 pattern works with the initial cases but he does not explicitly write down the general
 case as he does here.

 Then in the second part of the paper, "Alio investigatio eiusdem seriei" ["Another

 the triangular numbers, and generally the exponent corresponding to the

 number n will be 3nn£3n . These terms are preceded by two powers of jc
 each less by the same difference n ' thus by subtracting the number n twice

 In §6, we indicate two other proofs of the pentagonal number theorem, one using

 theta functions and one using modular forms.

 4 The Sum of Divisors Function

 Two problems involving the sum of divisors function cr(n) Euler was interested in are

 perfect numbers, which are numbers n such that cr(n) = 2 n, and amicable numbers,
 which are pairs of numbers m and n such that o(m) - m = n and cr(n) - n = m.
 Fermat looks at a lot of questions about the function n cr(n) - n, the sum of the

 proper divisors of n (see Weil 1984, Chap. II, §IV). The history of perfect numbers
 and amicable numbers and in particular Euler's results on them is given by Dickson
 (1919a, Chap. I).

 On p. 445 of his Fourth Notebook, Euler writes that, "Series 1 - n - n2 + n5 +
 n1 - nxl - n 15 + etc. = (1 - n)( 1 - n2)( 1 - n 3) etc. hanc habet proprietatem, ut,

 However, Euler does not state his recurrence relation for sums of divisors here.

 Euler first discussed his recurrence relation for the divisor function in a letter to

 Goldbach on March 21/April 1, 1747 (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 1 13). He says
 "Letztens habe ich eine sehr wunderbare Ordnung in den Zahlen, welche die sum-
 irías divisorům der numerorum naturalium darstellen, entdecket, welche mir um so

 viel merkwürdiger vorkam, da hierin eine große Verknüpfung mit der Ordnung der
 numerorum primorum zu stecken scheint. Dahero bitte Ew. Hochwohlgeb., diesen
 Einfall einiger Aufmerksamkeit zu würdigen." ["I have recently discovered a won-
 derful pattern among those numbers which represent the sums of the divisors of the
 natural numbers. This seemed all the more remarkable to me, since there seems to be

 here a great connection with the sequence of prime numbers. I request Your Honour

 to give some attention to this idea."] Euler defines the symbol fn as the sum of all the
 divisors of the number n and works it out for n = 1 to 16, and then writes

 Taking this meaning for the symbol /, I have thus found that

 fn = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) - f(n - 5) - f(n - 7) + f(n - 12) + f(n - 15)

 -f (n - 22) - f(n - 26) + etc.

 where 2 signs + and - constantly follow each other.25

 Euler says that the recurrence stops at negative numbers, and that n needs to be written
 in place of f(n - n).

 Euler shows that this rule holds for n = 1 to 12, and then says

 The reason for this pattern is so much the less obvious, that one does not see
 in what way the numbers 1,2,5,7,12,15, etc. would be related with the nature

 of divisors. Neither can I boast that I have a rigorous demonstration of it. Even

 25 "Diese Bedeutung des Zeichens J vorausgesetzt, so habe ich gefunden, daß

 Jn = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) - f(n - 5) - f(n - 7) + f(n - 12) + f(n - 15)

 -f ( n - 22) - f(n - 26) + etc.

 wo immer 2 Zeichen + und - aufeinander folgen/' (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief 1 13).

 though I had none, one could still not doubt about the truth, since until over 300
 this rule always holds. In the meanwhile, I have nevertheless properly derived

 this theorem from the following theorem.26

 Assuming the pentagonal number theorem, Euler gives the following derivation

 takes the logarithm, differentiates and then cross multiplies to express each bn in
 terms of bo, . . . ,bn-' and яо> . . . , an. Ferraro (2008, Chap. 10) explains the
 development of the idea of recurrent series.

 The first paper in which Euler gives his recurrence relation for the divisor function

 is his "Découverte d'une loi tout extraordinaire des nombres, par rapport à la somme

 de leurs diviseurs", presented to the Berlin Academy on June 22, 1747, and published
 in the Bibliothèque impartiale in 1751 (Euler 1751a), E175 (cf. Winter 1957, Nr. 45
 and Knobloch 1984, 1, Nr. 5, III, Nr. 84). He begins by saying that it seems that the

 order of the prime numbers is a mystery the human spirit will never penetrate. Then,

 I too believe myself quite far from this end, but I have discovered a very strange

 law on the sums of the divisors of the natural numbers, which, at first sight, seem

 as irregular as the progression of the prime numbers, and which appear even to

 envelop the latter. This law, which I shall explain, is in my opinion all the more

 important because it belongs to a type whose truth we can be assured of even if
 we cannot give a perfect demonstration of it. Nevertheless I shall present such
 evidence for this that one may consider it as almost equivalent to a rigorous
 demonstration.27

 Euler states fn for n = 1 to 100, and then states his recurrence relation for fn in

 the following way28:

 I remark nevertheless that this progression follows a well-defined law, and can
 even be counted among the class of progressions which Geometers call recur-
 rent, such that one can always form each term from some of the terms preceding

 it, according to a constant rule. For if fn denotes any term of this irregular pro-

 gression, and f(n - 1), f (n - 2), f (n - 3),f (n-4),f (n - 5), etc. the preceding
 terms, I say that the value of fn is always composed of some of the preceding

 27 "Je me crois aussi bien éloigné de ce but, mais je viens de découvrir une loi fort bizarre parmi les sommes

 des diviseurs des nombres naturels, qui, au premier coup d'oeil, paraissent aussi irrégulieres que la progres-

 sion des nombres premiers, et qui semblent même enveloper celle-ci. Cette régie, queje vai expliquer, est à
 mon avis d'autant plus importante qu'elle appartient à ce genre dont nous pouvons nous assurer de la vérité,
 sans en donner une démonstration parfaite. Néanmoins, j'en apporterai de telles preuves, qu'on pourra
 presque les envisager comme équivalentes à une démonstration rigoureuse." (Euler 1751a, §1), E 175.

 28 "Néanmoins, j'ai remarqué que cette progression suit une loi bien réglée et qu'elle est même comprise
 dans l'ordre des progressions que les Geometres nomment recurrentes, de sorte qu'on peut toujours former
 chacun de ces termes par quelques-uns des précédens, suivant une régie constante. Car si fn marque un
 terme quelconque de cette irréguliere progression, et f(n-l), fin - 2), fin - 3), fin - 4), fin - 5), etc.
 des termes précédens, je dis que la valeur de fn est toujours composée de quelques-uns des précédens
 suivant cette formule:

 fn = fin - 1) + f(n-2)-f(n-5)-f(n-7) + f(n - 12) + fin - 15)

 terms according to this formula:

 fn = f(n - 1) + J(n - 2) - f(n - 5) - f(n - 7) + f(n - 12) + f(n - 15)

 -f (n - 22) - f(n - 26) + f(n - 35) -b f (n - 40) - f(n - 51)
 -f (n - 57) -h f(n- 70) + f(n-77)-f(n- 92) - f(n - 100) + etc.

 He then states the general rule for the recurrence relation, that the plus and minus

 signs switch back and forth in pairs, and that the differences 1 , 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, etc.

 of the numbers subtracted from n are alternately from the sequence of all natural num-

 bers and the sequence of the odd numbers, and that f(n - n) must be replaced by n.
 He verifies the recurrence for n = 1 to 20, and also n = 101 and n = 301.

 Euler explains that he found this recurrence relation for sums of divisors in his

 research on the pentagonal number theorem, which he is still not able to prove:

 I admit that I did not fall upon this discovery purely by chance; rather, another

 proposition of the same nature, which must be judged to be true even though
 I am not able to give a demonstration of it, opened the way for me to find this

 pretty property.29

 Namely, if

 (1 - x)(l - *2)(1 - *3)(1 - *4)(1 - *5)(1 - JC6)(1 - Jt7)(l - л:8) etc.

 = 1 - X - X2 + *5 +X1 - X12 - X15 + X22 + X26 - X 35 - X40 + etc.,

 then the recurrence relation for sums of divisors follows by taking the logarithmic
 derivative of both sides. Euler says,

 Having thus discovered that these two infinite expressions are equal, although
 the equality cannot be demonstrated, all the conclusions which one can deduce

 from this equality will be of the same nature, that is to say true without being
 demonstrated.30

 Pólya (1954, Chap. VI) looks at Euler's use of "inductive reasoning" to justify
 the recurrence relation he found for cr(n). Pólya translates and gives commentary on
 E175.

 Euler explains his ideas about induction, e.g. in his 1 736 paper "Theorematum quor-

 undam ad números primos spectantium demonstratio", E54, his 1748 paper "Dem-
 onstration sur le nombre des points, où deux lignes des ordres quelconques peuvent
 se couper", E148, and his 1753 paper "Specimen de usu observationum in Mathesi
 pura", E256. In the "Summarium" (editorial summary) of E256, Euler writes,

 29 "J'avoue aussi que ce n'a pas été par un pur hazard queje suis tombé sur cette découverte; mais une autre

 proposition d'une pareille nature qui doit être jugée vraie, quoique je n'en puisse donner une démonstration,
 m'a ouvert la chemin de parvenir à cette belle propriété." (Euler 1751a, §8), El 75.

 30 "Ayant donc découvert que ces deux expressions infinies sont égales, quoique l'égalité ne puisse être
 démontrée, toutes les conclusions qu'on pourra déduire de cette égalité seront de même nature, c'est-à-dire
 vraies sans être démontrées." (Euler 1751a, §10), El 75.

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 35 1

 It is clear from this that in the science of numbers, which is still quite imperfect,

 much can be expected from observations, indeed from which new properties of

 numbers are constantly recognized, but a great deal of effort would need to be

 expended subsequently in proving these new properties.31

 In his published papers on the pentagonal number theorem, Euler does not work
 out the general case explicitly, but he makes it clear how to do it from the starting

 cases, i.e. the difference between not having found a proof and having found a proof

 is that when he found a proof, he finally understood exactly how to do the induction

 step, while before it was just observation. We saw in §3 that in his unpublished notes

 he works out the induction explicitly.

 Georg Wolfgang Krafft (1701-1754) writes to Euler on July 7, 1747 (Juškevič and
 Winter 1976, Brief Nr. 169) and says that Euler's recurrence relation for sums of divi-

 sors very much impressed him. Krafft says that previously he had considered 1 to be a

 prime number, but that this article has changed his opinion, since it follows from it that
 cr(l) = 1 instead of <r(l) = 2. Krafft had discussed the sums of divisors of numbers

 in previous letters to Euler, and also in papers in volume 7 of the Commentarii and
 volume 3 of the Novi Commentarii. Krafft was a physicist who had been a colleague

 of Euler's at the St. Petersburg Academy (Fellmann 1995, Kapitel И, p. 36). Krafft had

 been in St. Petersburg from 1728 to 1744, and then was a professor of mathematics

 and natural philosophy at the University of Tübingen.

 Euler next writes to d'Alembert about the pentagonal number theorem in a letter
 on February 15, 1748 (Juškevič and Taton 1980, Euler-ď Alembert, Lettre No. 13).
 Euler writes:

 With regard to the series l-x-x2 +x5+x1 etc. = (1- x)(l- x2){'- *3)(1- x4)
 which I have spoken about with you, I have found from it a very singular property

 of numbers, concerning the sum of the divisors of each number. With f n indi-

 cating the sum of all the divisors of the number n, such that /1 = 1; /2 = 3;
 /3 = 4; /4 = 7; /5 = 6; /6 = 12; /7 = 8 etc., it seems at first nearly
 impossible that one could discover any pattern in the series of these numbers
 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 12, 8, [15, ] 13, 18, etc., but I have found that each term depends on

 several of the preceding, according to this formula:

 fn = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2) - f(n - 5) - f(n - 7) + f(n - 12) + f(n - 15)

 - / (n - 22) - etc.

 where it is remarked Io that the numbers

 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 22, 26, 35, 40, etc.

 are formed easily by considering the differences alternately.

 ^ "Ex quo perspicuum est in scientia numerorum, quae etiam nunc maxime est imperfecta, plurimum ab
 observationibus esse expectandum, quippe quibus ad novas proprietates numerorum continuo deducimur,
 in quarum demonstratione deinceps sit elaborandum." (from the "Summarium" of E256).

 2° In each case one takes only those terms where the numbers after the / sign
 are not negative.

 3° If one comes to the term /0 or f(n - n ), one takes for its value the number
 n itself.

 352 J. Bell

 Thus, you can see that

 /4 = /3 -f /2 = 7;

 /9 = /8 + /7 - /4 - /2 = 15 + 8 - 7 - 3 = 13;

 /15 = /14 + /13 - /10 - /8 + /3 + /0 = 24 + 14 - 18 - 15 + 4 + 15 = 24;

 /35 = /34 + /33 - /30 - /28 + /23 + /20 - /13 - /9 + /0

 = 54 + 48 - 72 - 56 + 24 + 42 - 14 - 13 + 35 = 48.

 Next, every time that n is a prime number one will find that Jn = n + 1 and
 hence, since the nature of the prime numbers enters into this consideration, this
 law seems to me all the more remarkable.32

 D'Alembert replies to Euler in a letter on March 30, 1748 (Juškevič and Taton 1980,

 Euler-d' Alembert, Lettre No. 14), saying, "Il ne me reste de place que pour vous dire

 que votre Theoreme sur les suites me paroit tres beau" ["I only have enough space left
 to say to you that your Theorem on series seems very beautiful to me"]. D'Alembert

 32 "A l'égard de la suite 1 - * - jc2 + *5 + *7 etc. = (1 - ;t)(l - jc2)( 1 - *3)(1 - jc4) etc. dont
 je vous ai parlé, j'en ai tiré une propriété fort singulière des nombres par rapport à la somme des div-
 iseurs de chaque nombre. Que f n marque la somme de tous les diviseurs du nombre n de sorte que
 /1 = 1; / 2 = 3; / 3 = 4; /4 = 7; /5 = 6; / 6=12; /7 = 8 etc. il paroit d'abord presque impossible de
 découvrir aucune loi dans la suite de ces nombres 1,3,4, 7,6, 12, 8, [15, ] 13, 18, etc. mais j'ai trouvé que
 chaque terme depend de quelques uns des precedents selon cette formule:

 Jn = /(« - 1) + /(« - 2) - ¡{n - 5) - J(n - 7) + /(n - 12) + /(и - 15) - /(л - 22) - etc.

 où il est à remarquer Io que les nombres

 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 22, 26, 35, 40, etc.

 132537495

 = 54 + 48-72-56 + 24 + 42-14- 13 + 35 = 48.

 Donc toutes les fois que n est un nombre premier on trouvera que Jn = n + 1 et partant puisque la nature des
 nombres premiers entre dans cette consideration cette loi me paroit d'autant plus remarquable." (Juškevič
 and Taton 1980, Euler-d' Alembert, Lettre No. 13).

 2° Dans chaque cas on ne prend que les termes, où les nombres après le signe / ne sont point négatifs.
 3° S'il arrive ce terme /0 ou f (n - n), on prendra pour la valeur le nombre n même.
 Ainsi vous verres que

 /4 = /3 + /2 = 7;
 /9 = /8 + /7-/4-/2 = 15 + 8 - 7 - 3= 13;

 /15 = /14 + /13 -/10-/8 + /3 + /0 = 24+ 14- 18- 15 + 4+ 15 = 24;

 /35 = /34 + /33 - /30 - /28 + /23 + /20 - /13 - /9 + /0

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 353

 also tells Euler in this letter that his health is now very good, and that he soon hopes
 to send some memoirs to the Berlin Academy.

 On March 7/18, 1752, Euler sends his paper "Observado de summis divisorům"
 (Euler 1760b), E243, to Schumacher (Juškevič and Winter 1961, Brief 185). It was

 presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on April 6, 1752 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 396)
 and published in 1760 in the Novi Commentarli', the paper had been presented to the

 Berlin Academy on September 9, 1 75 1 (Knobloch 1 984, 1, Nr. 29; cf. Winter 1 957, Nr.

 226, Anm. 1). Euler remarks that it is unexpected that the sums of divisors of numbers

 would have a connection with the pentagonal numbers, writing "Interim tamen non
 fortuito et quasi divinando ad cognitionem huius veritatis perveni; cui enim in men-

 tem venire potuisset ordinem, qui forte in summis divisorům locum habuerit, ex natura

 serierum recurrentium ac numerorum pentagonalium per solam coniecturam elicere

 velie?" ["But in the meantime, I have come to knowledge of this truth not by chance

 and, as it were, by divination; for to whom could it have occurred to wish to elicit

 the order that might exist in the sum of divisors from the nature of recurrent series

 and pentagonal numbers by guesswork alone?"] In this article Euler again derives his

 recurrence relation for f n using the pentagonal number theorem:

 I was led to this observation by consideration of this infinite formula

 s = (1 - Jt)(l - JC2)(1 - x3)(l - x4)(l - лг5)( 1 - *6)(1 - Jt7)(l - X8) etc.,

 whose value, if it is expanded by actual multiplication of all the factors and

 arranged according to powers of x, I have found to be converted into the follow-

 ing series

 - etc.,

 s = 1 - X - X2 -h X5 + X1 - X12 - xì5 + X22 -h X26 - л;35 - x 40 + x5i -h x51

 where in the exponents of x the same numbers occurs which I described above,

 namely the pentagonal numbers, both themselves and continued backwards.33

 This article was reviewed on May 1761 Nova acta eruditorum (p. 218), which

 reviewed volume 5 of the Novi Commentarti,

 The illustrious author thus considered in this article the sum of all the divisors of

 any number, not to the ends that others typically pursue, for the investigation of

 33 "Deductus autem sum ad hanc observationem per considerationem istius formulae infinitae

 S = ( 1 - jc) ( 1 - jc2)(1 - x3)(l - JC4)( 1 - x5)(' - JC6)(1 - *7)(1 - jc8) etc.,

 cuius valorem, si multiplicatione singulorum factorum actu instituía evolvatur ac secundum potestates ipsius

 ubi in exponentibus ipsius jc iidem numeri occurrunt, quos supra descripsi, numeri scilicet pentagonales
 cum ipsi tum retro continuati." (Euler 1760b), E243.

 perfect or amicable numbers and other questions of this kind, but to consider the

 order and the law by which the sums of the divisors for all numbers proceed. This

 should indeed be considered as most deeply hidden, since for prime numbers the

 sum of divisors exceeds them by one, but for composites it is the greater the more

 prime factors that comprise them. Therefore since the rule of the progression

 of the prime numbers is still considered among the mathematical mysteries, in

 which not even Fermat was permitted to penetrate, could anyone fail to gather

 from this the difficulty of the problem? In solving this, the Illustrious Euler was

 so fortunate that he not only uncovered the law but also proved it in his third
 paper.34

 354 J. Bell

 The third paper in the mathematics section of volume 5 of the Novi Commentarti is
 Euler's "Demonstratio theorematis circa ordinem in summis divisorům observatum",
 E244.

 Euler's paper "Demonstratio theorematis circa ordinem in summis divisorům
 observatum" (1760a) was published in the same volume of this journal (cf. Juškevič

 and Winter 1961, Brief 189). In this article he gives an inductive proof of the pentag-
 onal number theorem, which we discussed in §3. Then in Proposition 4, or "Theor-
 ema principale demonstrandum" ["The principal theorem to be demonstrated"] Euler

 gives a rigorous proof of his recurrence relation for fn. As we remarked previously,
 Euler had earlier derived the recurrence relation from the pentagonal number theorem,

 which he hadn't been able to prove. Now he again derives it, and says "sicque habetur

 plena ac perfecta demonstratio theorematis propositi, quae, cum praeter tractationem

 serierum infinitarum, per logarithmos et differentialia procedat, minus quidem natu-

 ralis, sed ob hoc ipsum multo magis notabilis est aestimanda." ["and thus a complete

 and perfect demonstration of the proposed theorem is obtained, which, since it goes
 beyond the treatment of infinite series and proceeds by logarithms and differentials,

 is indeed not entirely natural, but because of this it should be thought all the more
 notable."]

 Goldbach writes a letter to Euler on May 9, 1752 (Juškevič and Winter 1965, Brief

 157; cf. Juškevič and Winter 1961, Brief 185), in which he says

 Your Honour's paper on the sums of divisors, which you sent to our Academy
 of Science, has been communicated to me by Prof. Grischow. I do not now

 think myself capable of judging its quality, but your well known insight in these
 matters permits me no doubts about the correctness of what is contained in

 the above-mentioned paper; in particular I saw with pleasure that Your Honour
 noticed such a beautiful pattern in the numbers 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 22, etc. But it

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 355

 occurred to me and I believe completely, that there are series such that the law

 of the progression, be it ever so short and simple in itself, nevertheless is not
 to be grasped, even from more than 100 consecutive terms of the series, as for
 example: Let the series be

 whose progression is such that given any term A corresponding to the index я,

 let A ± у/ (2 • 3n - 2 A2) = the next following term В , taking the sign + or -
 so that В will not be divisible by 3. This series has a sister series

 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)
 a... 1, 1, 5, 7, 1,23, 43, etc.

 made such that twice the square of the term whose exponent is n in the series

 ß , added to the square of the term whose exponent is the same n in the series a,

 would give 3", whence it is immediately apparent that the law of the progression
 of this series ß is A ± '/3n - 2 A2 = В , taking + or - so that В will not be
 divisible by 3.35

 Augustin Nathanael Grischow (1726-1760) was the conference secretary of the
 St. Petersburg Academy from 1751 to 1754. In the previous letters in their correspon-
 dence Euler and Goldbach were talking about Fermaťs polygonal number theorem.

 Edward Waring (1736-1798) mentions Euler's recurrence relation for o(n) in the
 preface of the 1762 edition of his Miscellanea analytica de aequationibus algebraicis
 et curvarum proprietatibus.

 35 "Eurer Hochedelgebornen Dissertation de summis divisorům, welche Sie an die hiesige Akad. der Wiss.

 vationes analyticae variae de combinationibus" (Euler 1751b, §37), E158. We also
 saw that he explains how the recurrence relation for p(n) follows from the pentag-
 onal number theorem in his November 10, 1742 letter to Nicolaus I Bernoulli. He

 also states the recurrence in his Introductio in analysin infinitorum (Euler 1 748, Caput
 XVI, §324).

 The next time the recurrence for p{n) occurs in Euler's work is in the paper "De par-

 titione numerorum", presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on January 26, 1750
 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 369) (sent to Schumacher on December 18/29, 1749 (Juškevič
 and Winter 1961, Brief 108)) and published in the Novi Commentarii in 1753 (Euler

 1753b), E191. In E158 and the Introductio , Euler had only briefly mentioned the
 recurrence relation for p(n) and he probably wanted to give some detailed examples
 now. In §§37-39, he looks at recurrence relations for n(oo). Then in §40, he states the

 pentagonal number theorem, and that (1 - дг)(1 - x2)(' - x 3) etc. is the reciprocal of
 the generating function for n(oo). In §41, he observes that this provides a recurrence
 relation for n^°°'

 This form therefore provides for us a scale of relation of the sought series, by
 which it is certain that

 n(00) = (л - 1)(00) + (И - 2)(oo) - (и - 5)<oo) - (Л - 7)(00) + (n - 12)(00)

 +(л - 15)(00) - (и - 22)(00) - (л - 26)(oc) + (л - 35)(oo)

 +(л - 40)(oo) - (л - 51)(oo) -{n- 57)(oo) + etc.

 That this law of progression holds will be evident to anybody testing it. For let
 n = 30, and it will be found that

 30(°°) = 29(oo) + 28(oo) - 25(oo) - 23(oo) + 18(oo) + 15(oo) - 8(oo) - 4(oo)-

 the number of ways to write и as a sum of four distinct positive integers, etc. For

 compute p(n) for n = I, N, there are approximately

 steps, which is upper bounded by 2yj' • Ms/I!. Hence, R(N) = 0(N 3/2).

 The Jacobi theta functions 0j, #2» #з, 0 are functions of two complex variables that

 are used to define elliptic functions, and which also have interesting applications to

 number theory. An excellent introduction is Chandrasekharan (1985, Chap. V). In the

 following we outline two proofs of the pentagonal number thereom using the Jacobi

 theta functions; the latter also involves the theory of modular forms.

 It will be convenient to use 6y, however, like the trigonometric functions
 sin, cos, tan, etc., each of the theta functions can be used to define the others. #3

 is defined by

 fc(v,T)= X 4n2e2nniv, (14)

 where q = eniT г > 0 and v is any complex number. For a fixed r, we can show
 that % converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets, and hence for fixed г, O3
 is an entire function of v. We can also show that O3 has the product expansion

 ' л =-00 n - - 00

 which gives the pentagonal number theorem, namely with x = e2jTlz.

 Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1 804-1851) proved many identities involving series and

 products. Chandrasekharan (1985, Chap. V) gives notes on this. Jacobi says in a letter
 (Stäckel and Ahrens 1908, Brief 10) that "Die Eulersche Formel ist ein spezieller
 Fall einer Formel, welche wohl das wichtigste und fruchtbarste ist, was ich in reiner
 Mathematik erfunden habe" ["The Eulerian formula is a special case of a formula that

 is the most important and most fruitful I have found in pure mathematics"], namely

 the product expansion ( 1 5) for 63 .

 Dedekind eta function satisfies the functional equation r] (-7) = yff • *](z) for

 > 0. Clearly rj(z -f 1) = eni^2r](z).
 We will now outline a proof due to Carl Ludwig Siegel (1896-1981) of the pentag-

 onal number theorem using the Dedekind eta function; this proof is given in detail by

 Chandrasekharan (1985, Chap. VIII). This proof uses the definition of O3 by (14) and

 does not assume the product expansion (15) for 63. Let g(z ) = е7ТП^12вз (j + §, 3 z)

 for > 0. We can show that g (-7) = yff * g(z )• It is clear that g(z + 1) =
 eni/i2g(z).

 360 J. Bell

 Now define K(z) = for > 0. Then K(z + 1) = K(z) and K(-') =
 К (z) for %z > 0. Since the full modular group SL2 W is generated by the transforma-

 tions z + it follows that for all ^ ^ € S¿2(Z), = K(z),
 for > 0. Also, r] and g are holomorphic in the half plane > 0, and r] has no
 zeros in > 0; hence, К is holomorphic in %z > 0. This means that К is a modular
 form of weight 0 for S¿2(Z); therefore, К (z) is constant on > 0, and must be zero

 because K(z) -> 0 as -> +00. Therefore, r¡{z) = елп^2 • #з(^ H- §, 3 z), which
 yields the pentagonal number theorem.

 Chandrasekharan gives historical references for the Jacobi theta functions (1985,
 Chaps. V and VIII) and the Dedekind eta function (1985, Chap. VIII). Indeed, the
 pentagonal number theorem is precisely the Fourier expansion of the Dedekind eta
 function.

 The 24th power of rj is a constant multiple of the modular discriminant , A(z) =
 (2n)X2e2niz n^LiO - e2ninz)24, %z > 0. A is a cusp form of weight 12forS¿2(Z).
 The Fourier coefficients of modular forms have interesting number theoretic proper-
 ties. For example, the Ramanujan tau function is defined as the Fourier coefficients of

 A. The pentagonal number theorem tells us the Fourier coefficients of rç. Rademacher
 (1940) talks about the Fourier coefficients of modular forms.

 Assuming Euler's pentagonal number theorem, we can prove the functional equa-
 tion r](- '/z) - л/ - i z • rf(z) of the eta function using twisted Poisson summation

 (Bump 1998, Chap. 1, Eq. 1.10). Twisted Poisson summation is a way of expressing
 a series J^L-oo X(n)f(n) in terms of Y,T=-oo X(n)f(n/N); here, x is a primitive

 Dirichlet character modulo N and / is the Fourier transform of /. Now,

 We then apply twisted Poisson summation to this series. This is worked out by Bump
 (1998, Chap. l,pp. 29-30).

 One can define automorphic forms for Г = SLifä) (or indeed a discrete subgroup
 Г of SL2W) for any real weight k using "multiplier systems" (see Iwaniec 1997,
 Chap. 2). This is to take care of branches of the logarithm. The Dedekind eta function

 is an automorphic form of weight к = 1/2 for SL2® and a certain multiplier system,
 which is explained by Iwaniec (1997, §2.8).

 We remarked in §1 that Euler thought the most natural way to prove that every

 nonnegative integer is the sum of four squares is by showing that for

 an> 0 for all n. Chandrasekharan (1985, Chap. X) gives a proof due to Jacobi using
 theta functions that

 n= 0 / #1= 0

 к=-о о / n= 0

 where r(n) = 8^¿|h 4 'd^ for л > 1 and r(0) = 1, which implies a fortiori that
 every nonnegative integer is the sum of four squares, since no integer has 4 as its only

 divisor. Chandrasekharan gives historical references for Jacobi's work on this.

 It will be helpful to clarify the relation between formal power series and analytic

 functions. This will let us understand why showing that the product Yl^Li 0 - xn) is

 equal formally to ^с^=_00(-1)пхп^п~1^2 suffices to show that they are equal as ana-
 lytic functions on the unit disk D. Let fn be a sequence of functions analytic on an open

 set U . If fn converges uniformly to / on every compact subset of U, then / is analytic
 on U (see Titchmarsh 1939, §2.81, iv). Furthermore, the product ПО + un{z)) con-

 verges uniformly in any compact set where the series 'un(z) ' converges uniformly
 (Titchmarsh 1939, §1.44). Now, let un(z) = -zn . The series I z Iя converges uni-
 formly in any compact subset of |z| < 1 ; hence, the product Пя^=1 0 - zn) converges
 uniformly in any compact subset of 'z I < 1. Since, fn(z) = (1 - z)(l - z2) • • • (1 - zn)
 is analytic in 'z' < 1 for each fixed n, f(z) = rKiiO - zn) is analytic on 'z' < 1.
 Then it follows from Taylor's theorem (Titchmarsh 1939, §2.43) that for some an ,
 П^=1(1 - zn) = anZn for all |z| < 1. Two functions that are analytic in
 |z| < R are equal in 'z' < R if and only if all the coefficients in their power series are
 equal (Titchmarsh 1939, §2.5).

 Let F be the set of all formal power series with complex coefficients. There are

 two natural topologies for F . The first is the product topology on C°° where each С

 has the discrete topology, and the other is the product topology on C°° where each С
 has the usual topology, which we will denote by 0' (F) and 02(F) respectively.

 In 0' ( F ), a sequence fn = Хь=о ^ converges to / = Xjb=o ^ f°r eac^ **хе(*

 point the terms with superscripts <N do not change in the sequence. In O2 (F), a

 as n -> 00. Also, Oi (F) is finer than 02(F), i.e., 0' (F) ç 02(F). So if /„ -> / in
 Oi(F) then fn -> / in 02(F).

 On the other hand, the set H (D) of functions that are analytic on the open unit disk

 can be given the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, where a sequence

 fn converges to / if for every compact subset К of D, fn converges uniformly to /
 on К (Cartan 1995, Chap. V, §1). Now, the map H(D) -► H(D) that sends / to its
 kih derivative / ^ is continuous. Since {0} is a compact subset of £>, for each fixed к

 the constant coefficient of f^ approaches the constant coefficient of / ^ as n -* 00.
 Thus, the map Го: H(D) -» (F, 02(F)) that sends a function analytic in D to its
 (formal) Taylor series is continuous; this is because Го preserves the convergence of
 sequences and H(D) is a metric space (Cartan 1995, Chap. V, Proposition 3.1).

 P - Q, But since Го: H {D) (F, 02(F)) is continuous, Го(/„) -* Го(/) and
 To(gn) To(g) in 02(F). Indeed 02(F) is Hausdorff, so it follows that Го(/) = P
 and To(g) = Q; hence, To(f) = To(g). Therefore, f = g as analytic functions on D.

 To find recurrence relations and identities for the partition function it suffices to use

 formal power series. But if we treat the infinite product JXiiO - ť1) as an analytic
 function in the unit disk then there are tools from complex analysis that we can use to

 get more information about the coefficients of

 1 00

 F(z)=m ^0^=2>)Л

 Treating the product as an analytic function lets us use information about the function

 as a whole, instead of just looking at each of the coefficients separately. Using the
 residue theorem we get

 p(n ) = J F(z)z~n~xáz

 kl =r

 for any 0 < 'r' < 1. In fact one can find an exact formula for p(n) as a certain series.
 This is worked out by Rademacher (1973, Chap. 14).

 Ferraro (2008, Chaps. 17-19) gives some more information on ideas about formal

 and analytic power series in the eighteenth century.

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 363

 We saw in §3 that Euler in his 1749 paper "Considerado quarumdam serierum

 quae singularibus proprietatibus sunt praeditae" (Euler 1753a), E 190, evaluates series

 related to the infinite product (1 - x) (l - |) (■ - í) о - *) о - etc. for
 a = 10 and particular values of x. In §§28-32 of that paper, Euler is interested in
 approximating the value of c^- *ast secti°n of Euler's "Methodus gen-
 eralis summandi progressiones" (Euler 1 738, §2 1 ), E25, presented to the St. Petersburg
 Academy on June 20, 1732 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 1 16). Let d(n) denote the number of
 positive divisors of n , for example d( 1) = 1, d(6) = 4 and d(l) = 2. In §32 of E190,
 Euler remarks that = E 190 is discussed in detail by Koelink
 and Van Assche (2009) and Gautschi (2008).

 Let f(x,m) = 1+¿¿=i(- ')k(xk(3k~l)/2 + хШМ)/2^ andg(jc, m) = ПГ=1^ -
 хк). For any 'х' < 1, /(; с, оо) = g(x , оо). For a given |jc| < 1 and number r of deci-

 mal places, we would like to know how many terms N we need to take so that the first r
 decimal places of /(jc, Л0 or g(x, N) agree with /(jc, oo) = g(jt , oo), in other words
 so that |/(jc, N) - f(x , oo)| < 10~r or |g(;c, N) - g(x, oo)| < 10~r, respectively.

 For instance, / (^, oo) = g (¡, oo) = 0.2887880950 /(¡,5) = 0.2887880

 950 . . . and g (5, 5) = 0.2980041503
 partial product, we have to take m = 35.

 Here is another example. /(5,0 o) = g (5, 00) = 0.7603327958 ...,/(5,3) =

 0.7603327958 . . . and g (j, 3) = 0.761856. To get this many digits of accuracy with
 the partial product we have to take m = 15.

 Foran alternating series ^^(-l)"^ with decreasing terms, | l)nan' <
 ayv. For real 0 < x < 1, /(jc, 00) is an alternating series with decreasing terms, which

 gives us an upper bound for the number of terms of the partial sum we need to take

 to obtain a given number of accurate digits. Now, let us work out an upper bound for

 how many terms in the product we need to multiply to get a given number of accurate

 digits.

 Probably Euler would have been interested in evaluating the product f(x) =

 X = 0 which give a nice result. Thus, Euler mostly used (1 - jt)(l - x2)(l - jc3) etc.
 as a formal power series.

 We can get a neat closed expression for rj(i ) using some elliptic function theory. The
 results about elliptic and modular functions that we use are given by Markushevich
 (1967, Chap. 5, §§21-24) and Bump (1998, §1.3).

 Let Л be the lattice generated by a and ai and p(z) = p(z; A) the Weierst-
 rass p function for the lattice. Here, a is a positive real number that we will choose
 appropriately to get a closed expression for rj(i).

 The Weierstrass function p (z) satisfies the following differential equation

 p'2(z) = 4 p3(z) - g2P(z) - 83,

 where g2 = gi (A) and g 3 = #з(Л) are defined by

 But Si = i, so Gb(i) = 0.

 The modular discriminant is defined by Д = (6OG4)3 - 27(140Сб)2. One can
 show that rç24 = (27t)_12A. Since, Ge(i) = 0, A(/) = (6OG4O'))3. Therefore to find

 r/(i) it suffices to find G 4(1).

 It follows from the Fourier series expansion of G 4 (z) that G4O) is a positive real

 Since g2 = 4, p ( z ) satisfies the differential equation

 p'2(z ) = 4(р3(г) -р(г)).

 One can show that p'iz) = 0 for z = a/2, ( a + ai) /2, ai/ 2. Then p(a/2), p((a +
 ш)/2), p (ai /2) are the three roots of 0 = 4(x3 - x). We know that the three roots of

 this equation are 0, 1 , - 1 .

 Now, one can show that p is one-to-one in the closed rectangle with vertices
 0,ö/2, ( a + ai)!2,aij2. Also, p is real on the four lines x = 0, x = a/2, y =
 0, y = a/2. Since p(z) = z~2 + o(') at z = 0, it follows that as z moves along
 the rectangle from 0 to a/2 to ( a + ai) /2 to ai /2 to 0, p (z) goes from +00 to -00.
 Therefore, p(a/2) = 1, p((a + ai)/ 2) = 0, piai/ 2) = -1.

 The Chowla-Selberg formula gives similar evaluations of r)(a) when Z[a] is the

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 367

 In particular (16) implies the result of Pietro Mengoli (1625-1686) in his 1650

 Novae quadraturae arithmeticae that

 In §§17-18 of his 1775 paper "Evolutio producti infiniti (1 - jc)(l - jcjc)(1 - jc3)(1 -

 X 4) etc. in seriem simplicem" (Euler 1783b), E541, Euler remarks that because of the
 pentagonal number theorem, the series s = 1 - x - x2 +x5 +X1 - xX2 - jc 15 + x22 +
 X26 - x35 - etc. will have the factors 1 - jc, 1 - jc2, 1 - jc3, 1 - jc4, 1 - x5, etc., and

 thus that every root of unity will be a zero with infinite multiplicity.

 The last paper in which Euler discusses the pentagonal number theorem and its
 applications is his "De mirabilibus proprietatibus numerorum pentagonalium", pre-
 sented to the St. Petersburg Academy on September 4, 1775 (Nevskaja 2000, p. 628)
 and published in the Acta in 1783 (Euler 1783a), E542. In §2, Euler notes that every
 pentagonal number is one-third of a triangular number (those numbers in the form

 n^2 ), and in §4 he gives his recurrence relation for the divisor function. Then in §7,
 Euler states the pentagonal number theorem, remarking that "Haec igitur non minus
 admirationem nostram meretur quam proprietas ante commemorata, cum nulla certe

 appareat ratio, unde ullus nexus intelligi possit inter evolutionem illius producti et no-

 stras numeras pentagonales" ["This therefore deserves our admiration no less than the

 property mentioned above, since there is certainly no obvious reason why there should

 be any connection that could be understood between the expansion of this product and

 our pentagonal numbers"].

 In the rest of this article, Euler considers the summation of series of the pentagonal

 numbers. We would say that he sums this series by the (£, con) and (A, con) methods
 of summation; these are defined by Hardy (1949). As

 where every root of unity is a root of the left-hand side, Euler uses Newton's identities

 1 Conclusion

 The pentagonal number theorem is important for three reasons:

 (1) developing the theory of infinite products,
 (2) Euler's theory of partitions, and generating functions,
 (3) elliptic and modular functions.

 It can be very useful to represent a product or series in different ways. One reason
 is that it can tell us things about the product or series. For example, when we study

 the Riemann zeta function, or L -functions in general, it can be useful to express the
 function as an Euler product over the primes or as a product over its zeros. Another

 reason is that we might be interested in the terms in the power series expansion, and

 thus if we have two power series expansions we can compare the terms.

 In §3, we worked out an unpublished proof of the pentagonal number theorem from
 Euler's notebooks. It turns out to be much more complicated than Euler's published
 proof, and this is probably the reason why it wasn't published.

 Euler used incomplete induction as an instrument of scientific research. Juškevič
 (Gillispie 1980, Volume IV, "Leonhard Euler", pp. 467-484) writes the following: "It

 Analytic results on o{n) are stated by Dickson (1919a, Chap. X). Kempner (1923)

 gives the history of the analytic study of p(n).

 Euler's work on the pentagonal number theorem 369

 is frequently said that Euler saw no intrinsic impossibility in the deduction of math-
 ematical laws from a very limited basis in observation; and naturally he employed
 methods of induction to make empirical use of the results he had arrived at through
 analysis of concrete numerical material. But he himself warned many times that an
 incomplete induction serves only as a heuristic device, and he never passed off as
 finally proved truths the suppositions arrived at by such methods" (also cf. Weil 1984,
 Chap. II, §111 and Cajori 1918).

 Euler explains his ideas about truth in letters CXV to CXX of his Lettres à une

 princesse d'Allemagne sur divers sujets de physique & de philosophie , E344, pub-
 lished in 1768 (Euler 1768). He says that all the truths which are within our grasp
 can be divided into three classes: "toutes les vérités, qui sont à la portée de notre con-
 noissance, se rapportent à trois classes essentiellement distinguées" ["all the truths

 which are within the reach of our understanding can be divided into three essentially
 distinguished classes"] (letter CXV, dated March 31, 1761). The first class are truths
 of experience, and they are established by evidence of the senses. The second class

 are truths of rational thought, established by correct reasoning. The third are truths of

 belief, established by credible statements.

 Although the three classes of truths are indeed separate, the status of some truth

 can change with time or be different for different people. As an example, in letter
 CXV Euler says that the fact that Russians and Austrians (namely soldiers) had been

 in Berlin is a truth of the third class for the princess, since she did not see them but

 only was told of them, while for Euler it is a truth of the first class since he saw them
 and talked with them.

 In this letter, Euler also writes that "Dans l'exemple de l'aimant nous ne savons

 pas, comment l'attraction du fer est un effet nécessaire de la nature, tant de l'aimant,

 que du fer; mais nous ne sommes pas moins convaincus de la vérité du fait" ["With the

 example of the magnet we do not know how attraction of iron is a necessary effect of

 the nature of either the magnet or of iron; but we are nonetheless convinced of the truth
 of the fact"]; earlier in the letter Euler had given the fact that a magnet attracts iron

 as an example of a truth of the first class. Perhaps if Euler could deduce the behavior

 of magnets from a more general theory he would have considered this a truth of the
 second class.

 In letter CXX (dated April 1 8, 1 761 ), Euler talks about how we can learn something

 about gravity by doing tests dropping stones, even though we have not dropped every

 possible stone from every possible position at every possible time. But Euler says
 that, "Cet exemple suffit pour faire voir à V[otre] A[ltesse] comment les experiences,
 quoiqu'elles ne roulent que sur des objets individuels, ont conduit les hommes à des
 connoissances très universelles: mais il faut convenir que l'entendement & les autres

 facultés de l'ame s'y mêlent d'une maniere, qu'il est très difficile de bien développer:
 & si l'on vouloit être trop scrupuleux sur toutes les circonstances, on n'avancerait
 rien dans toutes nos connoissances, & l'on serait arrêté à chaque pas" ["This example

 suffices to let Your Highness see how experiments, although they are conducted only

 on individual objects, have led men to very universal knowledge. However, we must

 also recognize that understanding and the other faculties of the soul are involved in

 some way that is very difficult to elaborate on; and if we wish to be overly fastidious in
 all situations, we won't advance at all in our understanding, and we will halt at every

 step"]. So we do not know a truth in physics just by doing a lot of tests, but rather we
 also need to use our intellect to know that these tests suffice.

 Now, we have seen that when Euler was expanding the product (1 - jc)(1 - jc2)(1 -

 jt3) etc. to check the pentagonal number theorem, he started to get an idea of how

 to prove the theorem. Working out examples like these gives us insight into why a

 theorem is true, instead of just showing that the theorem is true for lots of cases.

 One reason why Euler would want to talk about a statement being true which he

 had not been able to demonstrate yet is to focus his work on fruitful areas. If a state-

 ment is probably false, then assuming it might only lead to vacuous statements. But

 certainly Euler still wanted to find a proof of the pentagonal number theorem, even

 though he was convinced of its truth already by the examples he had checked. Euler
 mentions that having a proof of the pentagonal number theorem would give us deeper

 understanding of it and could lead us to new insights. In other words, having a proof

 would let us know why the theorem is true instead of just knowing it is true.

 Euler had a good idea of what a proof was, and would only say he had proved

 something if he thought he had a really rigorous proof. But he might still say that we

 can be absolutely certain about something that we cannot yet prove. But to know that

 something is certain by experience we need more than just a lot of cases, e.g., to know

 that a proposition P(n) is true for all n we need to know more than just the truth of
 P{ 1), . . . , P{ 10000), we need some information about P(n) that our insight/experi-
 ence/understanding can work on.

 Subscript notation would make complicated inductive arguments easier. In partic-

 ular it would make it clearer when it is an actual induction and not just specific cases.
 Sandifer (2007a) talks about this.
