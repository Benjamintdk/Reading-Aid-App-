 Abstract Bianchini called Tabulae magistrales a set of eight tables he compiled to

 solve problems in spherical astronomy. This set, which is the object of this paper,

 consists of auxiliary and trigonometric functions, including the sine and the tangent
 functions, for radii 10,000 and 60,000, and seems to be the first set of tables in Latin

 specifically devoted to mathematical tools for computational astronomy. Bianchini

 presented some of his tables in decimal form, which meant that for the first time one

 of the oldest astronomical tradition, the sexagesimal base (R = 60), was abandoned.

 Giovanni Bianchini (b. ca. 1400, d. after 1469) spent most of his life in Ferrara, where

 he served as administrator of the estate of the d'Este family. He had previously been
 a merchant in Venice until 1427, where it is likely that he attended some abacus

 school. In that year Marquis Nicolô d'Este (1383-1441) invited him to join his court

 in Ferrara. He found there the proper milieu to become a celebrated mathematician and

 astronomer. Bianchini is mostly known for an extensive and original set of astronomical

 tables for the motion of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets that he completed in 1442.1
 The tables were addressed to his patron Leonello d'Este (d. 1450), Nicolo's son and

 Vescovini (1968).

 A preliminary version of this paper was presented in a workshop held in Paris (SYRTE-Observatoire de

 Paris) in June 2015, "Analysing and editing numerical tables from ancient astral sciences." I thank all

 participants for their comments and suggestions. I am also grateful to Bernard R. Goldstein (Pittsburgh)

 for his helpful remarks on a draft of this paper.

 successor, and in 1452 they were presented and dedicated to the Emperor Frederick

 III, during a visit to the local court in Ferrara, then ruled by Borso d'Este (d. 1471).

 Bianchini's highly innovative tables were compiled in the framework of the Alfonsine

 Tables, as recast and developed in Paris a century earlier, and were printed for the
 first time under the title Tabulae astronomiae in 1495 in Venice. There were two later

 editions, one also produced in Venice in 1526 and another in Basel in 1553. Bianchini's

 planetary tables were appreciated and used by the most outstanding astronomers of

 his time, including Georg Peurbach (1423-1461) and Regiomontanus (1436—1476).2
 Bianchini is also the author of others texts and shorter collections of tables con

 cerning mathematical astronomy.3 In a letter dated November 21,1463, addressed to

 Regiomontanus, Bianchini listed some of his other works: Flores Almagesti, written

 around 1440 and consisting of several treatises on arithmetic and algebra to serve as a

 mathematical introduction to astronomy; a short text dated 1442 on an instrument to

 measure the altitude of the stars; a set of tables with canons on the primum mobile-;4

 and a set called Tabulae magistrales to facilitate the computational tasks of practi

 tioners of astronomy.5 This is the same letter where Bianchini presents an algebraic

 problem to Regiomontanus "Find two numbers in the ratio 5 to 8 whose sum equals its

 product."6 The analysis of the "magistral" tables mentioned in this letter is the object

 of the present paper.

 The Tabulae magistrales are a set of auxiliary tables consisting of six or eight

 trigonometric functions, depending on the manuscript, to solve a variety of problems

 in spherical astronomy. As far as I can determine, this is the first set of tables in Latin

 exclusively devoted to mathematical tools for computational astronomy. The need

 for such a set of tools to solve specific astronomical problems was already felt by

 early Arabic astronomers, who compiled for that purpose sets of auxiliary functions,

 consisting of basic trigonometric functions, such as the sine and the tangent functions,

 or combinations of them. This was the case, among others, of Habash al-Hâsib (ca.

 850), who included in his zijes the tangent function with a norm of 60, and Abu Nasr

 Mansur Ibn cIraq (ca. 1000), who provided compound auxiliary functions as well as

 instructions on how to apply them to a number of astronomical problems.7 Bianchini's

 auxiliary tables differ from those compiled by his Arabic predecessors.

 As is most often the case in medieval astronomy, the principle guiding table-makers

 was to produce labor-saving and user-friendly tables, as Bianchini explicitly explains:

 2 In a letter dated 1456 to Johann Nihil, court astrologer to Emperor Frederick ΠΙ, Peurbach described the

 calculation of ephemerides he had computed together with Regiomontanus, for which they used Bianchini's

 tables. While in Vienna in 1460 Regiomontanus made a copy of these tables for his own use and wrote

 abridged canons to them entitled, Canones breviati in tabulas Ioannis de Blanchinis. On Peurbach and

 Regiomontanus, see Swerdlow (forthcoming).

 3 On the trigonometrical tables of Bianchini, see Rosirtska (1981). For a list of Bianchini's various sets of
 tables extant in Cracow, see RosMska (1984).

 4 This term refers to the outermost celestial sphere, responsible for diurnal rotation, and can be translated

 literally as "first movable." The term was also used by John of Lignères and Regiomontanus, and eventually

 became standard, to characterize tables for spherical astronomy, most of which concern the diurnal rotation.

 5 See Magrini (1917), especially Letter II, pp. 24 and XIV. See also Gerl (1989).

 6 The two numbers sought are 13/5 and 13/8.

 7 See Jensen (1972), King (2004).

 An analysis of the Tabulae magistrales by Giovanni Bianchini

 545

 "composui tabulas magistrales iocundas et breves et utiles ad concluendum multos

 calculos" (BJ 556, 13r). And so he did in his Tabulae magistrales.

 This set of tables is extant in several manuscripts, including Bologna, Biblioteca

 Comunale, MS 1601, 66v, 85v-92v (8 tables); Cracow, Biblioteka Jagiellonska, MS

 556, 48r-54v, 93r (8 tables), and MS 606, 62r-69r (Tables 1-6); Paris, Bibliothèque
 nationale de France, MS 7270, 183v-186r, 188r, 228r-230v (Tables 1-7), MS 7271,
 181v-187v, 245v (Tables 1-7), MS 7286, 132v, 149r-154v (Tables 1-7), and MS

 10265,223v-232r, 237r-239r (Tables 1-6 and 8). For the presentation of the tables in

 this paper we take as base manuscript Cracow, MS 556 (henceforth BJ 556), copied in

 Rome about 1464 for Gregorius de Cracovia, astrologer of Pope Paul II. The sequence

 of the tables in this manuscript does not follow the expected order: Table 8 does not
 follow Table 7 but Table 1.

 The tables

 Table 1 (BJ 556, f. 48r-v): Divisio tabule magistralis primae sinus secundi maxime

 declinacionis per sinum primum cuiuslibet gradus

 The title refers to two basic trigonometric functions: sine (sinus primus) and cosine

 (sinus secundus). The entries are given at intervals of 0;10° of the argument, Θ,

 from 0;10° to 90;0°. The last entry, Ti(90°), is 9167, which is a rounding of 10,000
 • cos 23;33,30° = 10,000 · 0.916654.

 The function underlying Tabula magistralis 1, expressed in modern notation, is

 with R = 10,000, that is, the cosecant function with a coefficient R cos ε = 9167.

 That 23;33,30° is the value used for the obliquity of the ecliptic, ε, is clear from

 Bianchini's text (BJ 556, f. 7ra) where this value is explicitly mentioned, and from
 the Tabula novissima declinacionis per arcum secundum Iohannem Blanchinum (BJ

 556, f. 59r), where the maximum entry is 23;33,30°. Note that Bianchini's value for
 the obliquity of the ecliptic is the same as that used in the Toledan Tables and in

 other previous tables for the same purpose. However, all other entries in Bianchini's

 declination table differ,8 thus providing a good example of how inappropriate it is in

 medieval astronomy to identify two tables for the same purpose based only on a shared
 parameter. It happens that some astronomers or table-makers did not limit themselves

 to copying a pre-existing table; rather, they computed its entries independently.9 For

 the recomputation of selected entries in this and other tables, see Table A, below.

 As can be seen in Fig. 1, at the right of the column for T\ (θ) there is another

 column, headed "Equatio," intended for interpolation. To illustrate this, consider the

 row for argument 0;10°, where we are given the number 523610. This is indeed the

 number to be subtracted from Ti(0;10°) = 3142857 to obtain the following entry,

 8 See Chabâs and Goldstein (2012).

 9 For another example, see Levi ben Gerson's table of declination which is based on the same parameter

 used by Abraham Ibn Ezra, but the entries in their respective tables are all different: Goldstein (1974, p.
 96).

 Τι(0;20°) = 2619247. This method is valid for large numbers, but for the rest of
 the table in this column there are two numbers, one headed "numerus" and another

 headed "minuti," normally separated by a blank space or a dot. The purpose is the same,

 interpolation. Consider, for example, the entry for argument 17°, T](17;0°) = 31353.
 The associated numbers in the second column are 28 and 2. And indeed, Ti (17; 10°)
 = 31071 results from subtraction of 282 from 31353. Furthermore, to find the entries

 between 17;0° and 17; 10° we are supposed to use linear interpolation and subtract the
 integer 28 (here called "numerus") and 2 parts (here called "minuti"), as many times

 as needed. Here "minuti" are to be understood as decimal fractions (2/10 in this case).

 Thus, Ti(17; 1°) = 31353 - 28.2. Columns for the "Equatio" are found in all other
 tables, except for Tabula magistralis 7.

 Table 8 (BJ 556, f. 49r-v): Tabula magistralis octava. Numerus divisionis sinus

 primi cuiuslibet gradus per sinum secundum maxime declinacionis

 The entries in this table are also given at intervals of 0;10° of the argument, Θ,

 from 0;10° to 90;0°. The last entry, T8(90°), is 10905, which is a close approximation
 of 10,000/cos 23;33,30° = 10,000/0.916654 = 10,909.25. The function underlying

 Tabula magistralis 8 can be represented in modern notation by

 *8 V/ — « >

 cose

 with R = 10,000, that is, the secant function with a coefficient R/cos ε = 10,905. Note

 that the functions Ί\(θ) and Ts(0) are reciprocal, and Ti(0) · Ts(θ) = 108.

 Table 2 (BJ 556, f. 50r-v): Tabula magistralis secunda. Sinus primi différencie

 ascensionis cuiuslibet gradus eclyptice in circulum directum et circulum obliquum in
 regione graduum 45

 The entries in this table represent sin y, where γ is the ascensional difference, that

 is, the difference between the right ascension and the oblique ascension of a point on

 the ecliptic rising on the horizon.10 The entries in this table are displayed at intervals

 of 0; 10° of the argument, from 0; 10° to 90;0°. The independent variable here is the

 longitude, λ. The ascensional difference depends on the geographical latitude, φ, and

 can be computed by means of the modern formula

 where the declination, 8, is found in a declination table with the longitude of the point,

 λ, as argument or can be computed with the expression

 Bianchini compiled this table for Ferrara and considered its latitude to be φ = 45°;

 hence tan ψ = 1. This assumption considerably facilitates computation, because in
 this case

 sin γ = tan S tan φ,

 S (λ) = arcsin(sin λ · sin ε).

 sin y = tan δ.

 When λ = 90°, sin λ = 1, and <5 = ε; it follows that sin γ = tan ε. Now, the last
 entry, T2(90°), is 26161, which is indeed tan 23;33,30° times a coefficient, 60,000,

 not 10,000 as was the case for the two previous tables. Then it is easy to verify that

 the function underlying Tabula magistralis 2 can be represented by

 T2 (λ) = R tan<5 (λ),

 10 See, e.g., Chabâs and Goldstein (2012) (ref. 7), p. 30.

 where R = 60,000.

 Table 3 (BJ 556, f. 5 lr-v): Tabula magistralis tercia. Productum sinusprimi maxime

 declinacionis per sinum eius secundum et numerus quociens multiplicatus per sinum

 secundum ascensionis stelle secundum Iohannem Blanchinum queposite sunt in tabula
 radicum ascensionum

 In this table the entries are given at intervals of 0; 10° of the argument, but from

 0;0°, rather than 0; 10° as in the previous cases, to 90;0°. The entries agree in most

 cases with those in Tabula magistralis 2, but in the reverse order. The heading of the

 table suggests an expression of the type

 73(0) = Λ— cosa,

 cose

 where a is the right ascension. The Tabula radicum ascensionum mentioned in the

 heading is indeed found in Cracow, MS BJ 556, f. 59v. It is a table for right ascension

 given at intervals of 1° beginning at Aries 0°, with the longitude, λ, as independent

 variable. The large interval makes interpolation necessary, with uncertain accuracy.

 To check the entries, the right ascension can also be computed with the expression

 a — arcsin(tan 8/ tan ε),

 where tan S (λ) has already been tabulated in Tabula magistralis 2. The first entry here,

 for λ = 0°, is T3(0°) = 26160, and results from multiplying 60,000 by tan 23;33,30°.

 We note that in Tabula magistralis 2, this product was taken to be 26161. Again, for
 λ = 90°, sin λ = 1 and <5 = ε; thus a = 90°, and cos a = 0. Hence T3(90°) = 0. We

 have recomputed selected entries (see Table A), by means of

 Γ3 (λ) = R tan ε · cos a,

 with R = 60,000, and the expression for a given above. The agreement of text and

 recomputation is very good.

 Table 4 (BJ 556, f. 52r-v): Tabula magistralis quarta. Numerus divisionis sinus

 primi cuiuslibet gradus quarti circuli per sinus eius secundum11

 The entries in this Table (see Fig. 2) are given at intervals of 0; 10° of the argument,

 Θ, from 0;10° to 89;50°. The entry for 45° is 10,000, wrongly copied in MS BJ 556

 as 1000. The function underlying the table is

 Γ4 (Θ) = R^— = Λ tan#,

 cosy

 that is, the tangent function normed for a radius R = 10,000.

 Table 5 (BJ 556, f. 53r-v): Tabula magistralis quinta

 The entries in this table are also given at intervals of 0; 10° of the argument, Θ, from
 0; 10° to 90°. In this case T5(30°) = 20,000 and T5(90°) = 10,000. The underlying
 function is thus

 11 Excerpts of Tables 4 and 5 were published by Rosirtska (1981) (ref. 3), pp. 49-50.

 This table is different from those preceding it, for it involves quantities such as
 oblique ascension, ascensional difference, and semidiurnal arc that need to be com
 puted previously with other auxiliary tables: see Table B.

 The argument of this table is right ascension, a, given for each integer degree from
 1° to 360°. Column 2 displays the oblique ascension for geographical latitude 45°
 (Ferrara), where tan φ = 1. The oblique ascension, P, is the difference between the

 right ascension and the ascensional difference, Y. To recompute this column, we note
 that Tabula magistralis 2, only valid when tan φ = 1, gives sin y, as a function of the

 longitude, λ, not of a. Therefore, for each value of the argument, one first computes

 λ and then finds sin y in Tabula magistralis 2 to determine the ascensional difference.

 Then, an entry in column 2 is found by adding the ascensional difference just computed

 to the argument. To illustrate the procedure, consider α = 60°. The expression tan α =
 cos ε-tan λ gives λ = 62; 6,39°, which corresponds to sin y = 22631 in Tabula
 magistralis 2, and thus γ = 22;9,34° « 22; 10°. Therefore, the ascensional difference
 is 60° - 22; 10° = 37;50°, almost in agreement with the entry (37;51°). Column
 3 is the semidiurnal arc, and it can be computed by adding 90° to the ascensional

 difference. In the example considered, the arc sought is 90° + 22; 10° = 112; 10°,

 which is the entry in the table.

 Other tables

 In Cracow, BJ 556 there are also two other trigonometric tables by Bianchini that do

 not belong to the Tabule magistrales, although they are closely related to them: one

 displays the sine and the cosine functions, at intervals of 0; 10° of the argument (ff.

 57v-58v), normed R = 60,000, and the other is for the umbra (shadow), that is, the

 cotangent function (f. 47r-v), with the same interval, but normed R = 10,000. Note

 that Bianchini abandoned in this case the coefficient 12, or multiples of it, traditionally

 and immovably used in tables of shadows until then.

 The Tabule magistrales contain tables for radii 10,000 and 60,000. The sexagesimal

 base (R = 60) goes back at least to Ptolemy in his table of chords in Almagest 1.11, and

 was also used in the tables for the sine function. The entries were usually displayed at

 intervals of half a degree of the argument. To enhance precision Bianchini compiled
 new tables enlarging the radius to 60,000 and shortening the intervals to 0; 10°. How

 ever, decimalization was the real innovation in Bianchini's Tabule magistrales, for five

 of these tables were compiled for the first time for R = 10,000, thus abandoning in this

 particular case one of the oldest astronomical traditions, the sexagesimal base.

 This new approach was soon followed by many other astronomers, starting with a

 young contemporary of Bianchini with whom he corresponded, Regiomontanus, who

 in 1468 compiled a table for the sine function normed R = 107.12 Of special interest is

 also Bianchini's table for tangents (Tabula magistralis 4), with R = 104 and intervals

 of 0;10°, which Regiomontanus modified to a table that he called "fecunda," with

 a norm 10 times bigger (R = 105), but with a drastically reduced number of entries

 (intervals of 1°). Regiomontanus's tabulafecunda was part of his Tabulae directionum

 profectionumque (1467), published for the first time in 1490 and many times after (eight

 times in the sixteenth century). On the other hand, Bianchini's Tabule magistrales were

 not printed. This might explain why Regiomontanus, and not Bianchini, has often been

 considered by modern scholars responsible for "providing the model for our modern
 tables."
