 An anthropic myth: Fred Hoyle's carbon-12
 resonance level

 Abstract The case of Fred Hoyle's prediction of a resonance state in carbon-12,

 unknown in 1953 when it was predicted, is often mentioned as an example of anthropic

 prediction. However, an investigation of the historical circumstances of the prediction
 and its subsequent experimental confirmation shows that Hoyle and his contempo-
 raries did not associate the level in the carbon nucleus with life. Only in the 1980s,

 after the emergence of the anthropic principle, did it become common to see Hoyle's

 prediction as anthropically significant. At about the same time mythical accounts of

 the prediction and its history began to abound. Not only has the anthropic myth no
 basis in historical fact, it is also doubtful if the excited levels in carbon-12 and other

 atomic nuclei can be used as an argument for the predictive power of the anthropic
 principle.

 1 Introduction

 In the early days of 1953 the British astrophysicist and cosmologist Fred Hoyle
 famously predicted the existence of an excited state in the carbon-12 atomic nucleus,

 arguing that such a state was necessary for the production of appreciable amounts of

 carbon in the stars. The prediction was quickly confirmed in laboratory experiments

 and is today recognized as a breakthrough in the understanding of stellar nucleogene-
 sis. When the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prestigious Crafoord
 Prize of 1997 to Hoyle for his pioneering contributions to astrophysics, it mentioned

 specifically his prediction of the carbon energy level as "perhaps his most important

 single contribution within the field."1 The prize for 1997, which apart from the honor

 included half a million US dollars, was shared between Hoyle and the American astro-

 physicist Edwin Salpeter whose study on the "triple alpha process" in the 1950s was
 closely connected with Hoyle's.

 In spite of its importance, Hoyle's prediction has never been investigated from a

 historical perspective, nor has its relationship to the later anthropic principle been

 examined in any depth. My primary aim in this article is to offer a critical historical

 analysis of how Hoyle arrived at his prediction and the role it played in astrophysics
 in the 1950s. I am particularly concerned with the alleged anthropic nature of the
 prediction and how Hoyle himself looked upon the question. Is it really true, as was

 asserted by theoretical physicist Leonard Susskind, that Hoyle was able to predict the

 synthesis of carbon "just from the fact that we are here"?2 Apart from examining the

 anthropic claim, I describe the state of research on stellar nucleosynthesis in the years

 before and after Hoyle's prediction, paying particular attention to the experimental

 work done by William A. Fowler and his group of nuclear physicists at the Kellogg
 Radiation Laboratory.

 While my article is basically a contribution to the history of astrophysics, it also

 addresses issues of a more general nature related to anthropic predictions. This sub-
 ject is of considerable philosophical interest and has several times been discussed
 within the context of philosophy of science.3 I shall argue that the proper philosophi-

 cal significance of the case of the carbon- 12 resonance can only be appreciated if its

 complex history is taken into account. In the last section I discuss from a more general

 perspective the possible anthropic significance of Hoyle's remarkable prediction.

 2 The anthropic claim

 The anthropic principle was first explicitly formulated by the Australian-born astro-

 physicist Brandon Carter, a former student of Dennis Sciama, in a lecture at Cracow in

 1973. According to Carter, the essence of what he called the weak anthropic principle
 (WAP) was that "we must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location
 in the universe is necessarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our
 existence as observers."4 Ever since Carter's announcement of the anthropic princi-

 ple it has been discussed whether this controversial principle (in one of its several
 versions) belongs to science or philosophy. It is generally agreed that the anthropic

 principle, to be of any scientific value, must result in predictions of more or less the
 same kind as known from ordinary scientific theories, preferably in precise predictions

 of phenomena that are not known to exist at the time of the prediction. Among the very

 few anthropic predictions - and possibly the only one - that belong to this category

 An anthropic myth 723

 is Fred Hoyle's prediction in 1953 of a definite resonance state in carbon- 12, the one

 that most frequently has appeared in the anthropic literature.

 To summarize this well-known case, in 1953 Hoyle realized that to make enough

 carbon inside the stars, there had to exist a resonance state of the carbon- 12 nucleus

 at 7.68 MeV above the ground level. At the time this state was not known experimen-

 tally. Although Hoyle's theoretical arguments were at first met with some skepticism,

 experiments made at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) soon confirmed

 the predicted resonance. Hoyle had apparently shown that an unknown property of
 the carbon nucleus, a manifestation of the precise strength of the nuclear and electro-

 magnetic forces, follows from the undeniable existence of carbon-based life. We exist,

 consequently there must be a 7.68 MeV carbon-12 resonance! The story of how Hoyle
 made his famous and alleged anthropic prediction has been told numerous times, in

 many cases as evidence of the predictive power of anthropic arguments. "Hoyle was
 rigorously applying what would later become known as the anthropic principle," one
 can read.5 "This was the first and only time that a scientist had made a prediction using

 the anthropic principle and had been proved right." Statements like this abound, both

 in published sources and, not least, on the internet.

 To my knowledge, the first time that the case of the carbon resonance appeared

 explicitly in an anthropic context was in an influential article by Bernard Can* and
 Martin Rees of 1979, in which the two scientists discussed and summarized all the

 arguments for the anthropic principle known at the time. However, apparently Carr
 and Rees did not consider the 7.65 MeV resonance level a proper case of anthropic

 prediction, for they concluded that the anthropic principle "is entirely post hoc: it has

 not yet been used to predict any feature of the Universe."6 Ten years later, Rees, now in

 a popular book written jointly with the astrophysicist and science writer John Gribbin,

 gave a much more detailed account of the case and its anthropic nature. As the two
 authors noted, most anthropic arguments are made with the benefit of hindsight, the

 predictions being really postdictions r. "But Hoyle's prediction is different, in a class

 of its own," they said, "It is a genuine scientific prediction, tested and confirmed by
 subsequent experiments."7 They elaborated:

 Hoyle said, in effect, "since we exist, then carbon must have an energy level
 at 7.6 MeV." Then the experiments were carried out and the energy level was
 measured. As far as we know, this is the only genuine anthropic principle pre-

 diction; all the rest are "predictions" that might have been made in advance of

 the observations, if anyone had the genius to make them, but that were never in

 fact made in that way. . . . There is no better evidence to support the argument
 that the Universe has been designed for our benefit - tailor-made for man.8

 We find what is basically the same argument, spelled out in considerable detail, in

 The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, the encyclopedic and influential study pub-

 lished by John Barrow and Frank Tipler in 1986. The two authors referred to "Hoyle's

 anthropic prediction" not only in connection with the carbon resonance but also with

 regard to the energy levels of oxygen- 16: "Hoy le realized that this remarkable chain

 of coincidences - the unusual stability of beryllium, the existence of an advantageous

 resonance level in C12 and the non-existence of a disadvantageous level in O16 - were

 necessary, and remarkably fine-tuned, conditions for our own existence and indeed

 the existence of any carbon-based life in the Universe."9 Using the past tense, readers

 of the book inevitably get the impression that Hoyle's anthropic insight went back to

 his study in 1952-1954, whereas in reality, as we shall see, it dates from a much later

 period. Barrow was among the first scientists to explicitly describe Hoyle's prediction

 as anthropic, such as he did in an article of 1981, although at that time he did not claim

 that the prediction was actually anthropically motivated.10

 A good story told many times easily becomes self-perpetuating. It tends to live a

 life of its own; there are many examples in the history of science, Hoyle's anthropic

 prediction being one of them. In an early bibliography of anthropic literature, the
 philosopher Yuri Balashov repeated the myth: "In 1953 Hoyle made an anthropic
 prediction of an excited state - 'level of life' - of 12C at 7.6MeV needed for carbon

 production in the interior of stars."11 The claim reappears in the more recent litera-

 ture, both scientific and popular, in much the same form as when it was first told in the

 1980s. Thus, to the prominent theoretical cosmologist Andrei Linde, "the existence
 and properties of this [carbon] resonance was one of the first successful predictions

 based on the anthropic principle."12 Also Brandon Carter, the inventor of the anthropic

 principle, came to believe that the prediction qualifies as anthropic. In 2006 he said:
 "A prototype example of the application of this 'strong' kind of anthropic reasoning

 was provided by Fred Hoyle's observation that the triple alpha process ... is extremely

 sensitive to the values of the coupling constants governing the relevant thermonuclear

 reactions in large main sequence stars."13

 What may be called the "anthropic myth" exists in two versions. One of the versions,

 illustrated by the quotations from Linde and Carter, reconstructs Hoyle's argument as

 defacto anthropic, without making a historical claim. According to the other version,

 exemplified by the quotations from Balashov and from Barrow and Tipler, Hoyle was

 originally motivated by considerations of life in the universe to make the prediction.
 The cosmologist Jayant Narlikar, a close collaborator of Hoyle, writes about Hoyle's
 motivation for making the prediction of the resonance level that life would be impos-

 sible without carbon and oxygen. "Thus the fact that we human beings are around to

 13 Carter (2006, p. 176). The strong anthropic principle (SAP) exists in several versions, but can be boiled
 down to the statement that the universe must have those properties that allow (intelligent) life to develop

 within it at some stage in its history. The weak form of the anthropic principle (WAP) is the almost (but only
 almost) trivial statement that the observed properties of the universe must be consistent with observers.

 observe the universe makes it imperative that the route to making carbon and oxygen

 As one might expect, the story is an element in many of the obituaries, biographies,

 and commemorative articles which have appeared after Hoyle's death in 2001 . "Hoyle

 had anticipated the anthropic principle by arguing that because we are here, this C12

 excited state must exist," says one of the obituaries written by a distinguished astro-

 physicist.15 On the occasion of the fifty-year's anniversary of the 1953 prediction,
 The Guardian included an article on how Hoyle originally presented his deduction
 of a 7.65 MeV state to the American nuclear experimentalist and later Nobel laure-
 ate William A. Fowler. "The state had to exist, reasoned Hoyle, because life existed

 and life was based on carbon." The skeptical Fowler found it outrageous: "What com-

 pounded Fowler's amazement was the manner of Hoyle's prediction. He had predicted
 the 7.65 MeV energy state of carbon-12 using an anthropic argument: it had to exist
 because, if it didn't, neither could human beings. To Fowler, such flaky logic smacked

 of religion rather than science. To this day, Hoyle is the only person to have made a

 successful prediction from an anthropic argument in advance of an experiment."16

 Many more examples could be provided, but the ones quoted will suffice to illus-

 trate the widespread belief or myth that Hoyle's prediction of the early 1950s was an

 early example of bona fide anthropic reasoning, or an anticipation of the anthropic
 principle avant le mot. The problem with the belief is not the predictive nature of
 Hoyle's argument, but its supposed anthropic nature.

 3 The triple alpha process

 From a historical point of view, the problem of explaining the formation of chemical

 elements is closely related to the problem of accounting for energy production in the

 stars.17 While the latter problem goes back to Arthur Eddington's seminal studies of

 the 1920s, culminating in his classical study, The Internal Constitution of the Stars of
 1926, the first one was pioneered a decade later by George Gamow, Harold Walke,
 Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, and a few other physicists. In a pathbreaking study of

 1939, Hans A. Bethe developed a detailed quantum-mechanical theory of the nuclear
 processes fueling main sequence stars such as the Sun. According to Bethe, the key

 process was a cyclic reaction where four protons, interacting catalytically with carbon

 and nitrogen nuclei, were turned into an alpha particle.18 He also briefly considered

 red giant stars, but only to conclude that the cyclic reaction did not work for these.

 In Bethe's theory of the carbon-nitrogen (CN) cycle, carbon played a crucial role

 as a catalytic agent, but Bethe merely assumed the existence of carbon rather than
 accounting for its genesis. Although his theory was mainly concerned with energy

 production, and not with nucleosynthesis, he did discuss what he called triple colli-

 sions of alpha particles, including the direct formation of carbon- 12 by the collision
 of three alpha particles, that is, 3 4He -> 12C. However, he found that the yield of
 carbon would be negligible unless the temperature was T ~ 109 K, much higher than
 the 2 x 107 K of the interior of the Sun and similar stars. Bethe concluded that "there

 is no way in which nuclei heavier than helium can be produced permanently in the

 interior of stars under present conditions."19 Yet, somehow carbon, oxygen, and the
 other elements had come into existence. How?

 726 H. Kragh

 Bethe's study relied intimately on experimentally determined cross sections for

 nuclear reactions, and it demonstrated to nuclear physicists that their work might be
 valuable, indeed crucial, to the physics of the stars. Physicists at Caltech's Kellogg
 Radiation Laboratory, built in 1931 with funds supplied by the Detroit cornflakes
 magnate Will Keith Kellogg, were among the first to enter the new field of nuclear

 astrophysics.20 Under the leadership of Charles Lauritsen, they were already studying

 the reaction between carbon-12 and protons - meaning 12C(p, y)13N - the first pro-

 cess in the CN cycle, although at first without thinking of its astrophysical relevance.
 Bethe's study on the CN cycle came as a revelation, as recalled by Fowler, who had
 joined Lauritsen's group in 1933 while still a graduate student: "Bethe's paper told
 us that we were studying in the laboratory processes which are occurring in the sun
 and other stars. It made a lasting impression on us."21 It was only after World War

 II, however, that Fowler and other Kellogg physicists began to focus on low-energy

 nuclear astrophysics, first on energy-producing processes and later on stellar nucleo-

 synthesis. Detailed studies of the rate of the CN cycle led Fowler and his collaborators

 to conclude that the CN cycle did not power the Sun, such as Bethe had argued. The

 dominant process in the Sun, they concluded, was the proton-proton chain that had

 been presented by Bethe and Charles Critchfield a little earlier than Bethe's study on

 the CN cycle.22

 The Kellogg Laboratory had the advantage that it was part of an institution, Cal-
 tech, which at the time became strongly engaged in astronomy and astrophysics. The

 turn to nuclear astrophysics was supported by Ira Bowen, a Caltech physics professor

 who had done work on cosmic rays and astrospectroscopy and in 1946 was appointed

 director of the Mount Wilson Observatory. When the astronomer Jesse Greenstein in

 1948 came to Caltech to build up an astronomy graduate program it further helped to

 give the laboratory a clearer orientation toward experimental astrophysics, at the time

 the only institution of its kind. One of the Fowler's first astrophysical studies, a review

 dealing with stellar nucleosynthesis, was done in collaboration with Greenstein.23

 While the production of heavier elements was not part of Bethe's astrophysical
 study, it was of crucial importance to the cosmological research program initiated by

 19 Bethe (1939, p. 446). The "present conditions" Bethe referred to were the density and temperature in
 the interior of main-sequence stars, about /> = 3Ogcm~3 and T = 2 x 107 K.

 George Gamow in 1946 and developed in collaboration with Ralph Alpher and Robert

 Herman in particular. The essence of the Gamow approach to cosmology was the big

 bang assumption of an early, hot, and compact universe in which the elements had

 been formed by neutron capture and other nuclear processes within the first few hours

 of the cosmic expansion. However, it turned out that only the formation of the light-

 est elements, the hydrogen and helium isotopes, could be explained in this way. The

 problem, known as the "mass-gap problem," was the nonexistence of nuclei of atomic
 weights 5 and 8 which were needed as "bridges" between helium and carbon. Even
 before the war, Kellogg physicists Hans Staub and William Stephens had confirmed
 that there was no stable helium nucleus at mass 5.24 The same was later shown to

 be true for lithium-5, the other candidate nucleus at mass 5. Moreover, it was also

 assumed that the same was the case for mass 8, the lifetime of beryllium-8 being only

 about 10~16 s.25 The instability of the three nuclei was convincingly argued by Bethe

 in his 1939 article on the CN cycle.

 Gamow and his associates tried hard to solve or circumvent the mass-gap problem,

 but their efforts met with no success. The problem was studied in detail by Enrico

 Fermi and his Chicago colleague Anthony Turkevich, but after many ingenious sug-

 gestions they, too, were "left with the sad conclusion that this theory [Gamow's] is

 incapable of explaining the way in which the elements have been formed."26 In regard

 of Hoyle's later prediction it is of some interest to note that at one stage Fermi and
 Turkevich considered the process

 3H + 4He -► 7Li + y .

 They found that "a resonance would have to be at about 400 keV or closer in order

 to convert any appreciable amount of the material into Li7."27 Unfortunately no such

 resonance had been found experimentally and for this reason the attempt to bridge the
 gap at mass 5 was abandoned. Another suggestion, made by Turkevich and based on
 an unpublished idea of Eugene Wigner, was the exothermic process

 3H + 10C -* 6Li + 7Be.

 However, the hypothetical reaction fared no better than other suggestions.

 By the early 1950s it thus seemed impossible that carbon and the other heavy ele-
 ments of atomic number Z > 4 could have been produced cosmologically in the early
 universe, and it seemed equally impossible that they could be produced in ordinary
 stars. In a study of 195 1 the Estonian-Irish astronomer Ernst Öpik suggested that what

 was not possible in ordinary main-sequence stars might be realized in red-giant stars.28

 In the late phase of such a star the contracting core reaches a temperature of about

 4 x 108 K, and Öpik argued that at this temperature it would be possible for nearly
 all helium to convert into carbon by a triple alpha process, thus circumventing the

 mass-gap problem. However, Öpik's article had almost no influence and was initially

 unknown even to astrophysicists working in the same research area.

 One of those astrophysicists was Edwin Salpeter, a young Austrian-born theorist at

 Cornell University who had worked with Bethe on problems of quantum mechanics

 and quantum electrodynamics. In the summer of 1951 Salpeter was invited to spend

 some time with Fowler and his group at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory. In one of

 his first studies on nuclear astrophysics Salpeter argued, much like Öpik but in greater

 detail, that in red-giant stars at T > 108 K three alpha particles would fuse into car-

 bon.29 In spite of the instability of beryllium-8, a small amount of this isotope will be

 built up, just sufficient to permit the further addition of an alpha particle. Salpeter's

 process would occur in the two reactions

 4He + 4He + Ch -* 8Be + y (Çh = 95 keV)

 4He + 8Be -* 12C* -> 12C + y + Q2 (Q2 = 7.4 MeV) .

 For the rate of energy production £ of the triple alpha process, as expressed in units

 of erg g"1 s"1, he found for temperatures T ~ 2 x 108 K

 ě = 103(2Aw)2{2^¥kTYÍ'

 where p is the density in gern"3 and Y is the concentration by weight of helium.

 Salpeter first calculated these results in July 1951, during his stay at Caltech.30

 Measurements made at Los Alamos and the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory a few

 years earlier had confirmed that beryllium-8, although unstable, is only so by a slight
 amount, namely about 95keV. The Los Alamos physicist Arthur Hemmendinger
 obtained 103 ± lOkeV for the disintegration energy of beryllium-8 into two alpha

 particles, while Fowler and his collaborators reported 89 ± 5 keV.31 Salpeter reasoned
 that the ground state of the nucleus provided a resonance level at a low excitation

 energy for a pair of alpha particles. Thus, at the high temperature in a red giant, there

 will be a fraction of the alpha particles that have thermal energies high enough to form

 beryllium-8 nuclei. Although these have a lifetime of only 10~16 s, at a temperature
 in the vicinity of 2 x 108 K beryllium-8 will be continuously present. According to

 Salpeter's estimate, the result would be an equilibrium ratio of beryllium-8 to helium-
 4 of the order of 10~10. Under these conditions beryllium-8 could absorb another

 alpha particle and form carbon- 12. Salpeter also considered (as had Öpik) the further
 formation of elements of Z > 6, such as

 12C + 4He -+ 16O + y + Qx (Qj = 7.1 MeV)
 16O + 4He->20Ne + )/+Q2 (Q2=4.7MeV).

 Taking into account the resonance effects due to the ground state of beryllium-8,

 Salpeter's rate equation indicated a rate for helium burning considerably greater than

 the one calculated by Öpik (which he did not know about at the time). In his brief arti-

 cle published in the Astrophysical Journal in 1952, Salpeter noted that the calculated

 rate might depend on the position of resonance levels in carbon- 12.32 If an appropriate

 resonance level existed, the production rate could be larger than the estimated one by

 a factor of 1,000 or more. But he did not follow up on the remark. Fifty years later

 Salpeter reflected that "I did not have the chutzpah (or guts) to do anything about it."
 The calculation made in 1951, he said (evidently with hindsight), "would lead to most

 of the helium being converted to oxygen and neon instead of carbon, but I just did not

 have the guts to think of resonance levels that had not been found yet!"33

 4 Prediction and confirmation

 Fred Hoyle had the chutzpah that Salpeter admittedly lacked. Contrary to Salpeter,

 Hoyle had for long been interested in nuclear astrophysics and the processes in the

 interior of the stars that generated the chemical elements. In an important article of

 1946 he examined the formation of heavier elements up to about the middle of the peri-

 odic system, concluding that the most abundant of these elements would be grouped
 about iron.34 As to the lighter elements, he assumed that carbon- 12 was somehow
 formed by helium nuclei, but without considering the mechanism. In this long and

 complex article he did not deal with the details of the nuclear reactions but merely

 established the general framework for element formation.

 In the fall of 1952 Hoyle was invited to spend the first 3 months of 1953 at Caltech.
 Having arrived in Pasadena a few days before New Year, he decided to follow up on
 Salpeter's study by taking a fresh look at the triple alpha process generating carbon.
 One reason for his dissatisfaction with Salpeter's calculations may have been his con-

 viction that helium burning in red giants should start at temperatures just above 108 K

 rather than at 2 x 108 K as assumed by Salpeter. Greatly interested in all aspects of
 stellar evolution, Hoyle was aware of a recent study by Allan Sandage and Martin
 Schwarzschild on stellar models with gravitationally contracting cores. According to
 one of the models by Sandage and Schwarzschild, the central temperature might be
 as low as 1.1 x 108 K, which they admitted was "rather lower than the temperature

 needed for helium burning (2 x 108 K) as derived by Salpeter."35 While Sandage and

 Schwarzschild did not consider the discrepancy to be serious, Hoyle saw it as a problem
 for Salpeter's reaction-rate equation. Much later, Hoyle recalled his reconsideration

 of the triple alpha process:

 Salpeter's publication of the 3a process freed me to take a fresh look at the car-

 bon production problem. I found difficulty in generating enough carbon, because

 the carbon kept slipping away into oxygen as it was produced. A theoretically

 possible way around this difficulty was greatly to speed-up the carbon synthesis

 by a rather precisely tuned resonance which would need to be about 7.65 MeV

 [originally 7.68 MeV] above ground-level in the 12C nucleus.36

 In another recollection of the events from his fruitful stay at Caltech, Hoyle said:

 It was in early January, 1953 that I decided to add 8Be(a, y)12C to the 3a pro-

 cess, finding that it appeared to scour out the carbon as fast as it was produced.

 Bad luck for poor old Ed I thought to myself, through a happy hour or two before

 common sense reasserted itself. There just had to be some way of synthesizing
 12C. Nothing was better than 3a and so 3a had to go a lot faster than it had
 been calculated to do. To go faster, a resonant state at about 7.65 MeV above
 the ground state would be needed. The trouble was that there appeared to be no

 such state, which was the problem I had on my mind as I walked into Willy's
 [Fowler's] office in the Kellogg Laboratory.37

 That is, Hoyle realized that to get an appreciable fraction of the original helium trans-
 formed into carbon-12, the 8Be(a, y)12C process had to proceed resonantly at an
 energy level of about 7.68 MeV or 0.31 MeV above the sum of the masses of beryl-
 lium-8 and helium-4. The predicted state was about 3.2 MeV above the first excited
 state of carbon-12, which was known experimentally (Fig. 1). "Assuming . . . that the

 Be8 + a reaction through this level is not forbidden by strict selection rules," he wrote

 in an article of 1954, "the resonance contribution from it quite overwhelms not only

 the nonresonance yield but also the resonance contributions from other levels."38

 With the new hypothesized resonance the carbon yield would increase by a factor

 of about 107 compared to that of the Salpeter process. Moreover, Hoyle also realized
 that the enormous enhancement of the triple alpha process by means of the resonance

 was not enough to secure a sufficient net yield of carbon-12. Because, if the produced
 carbon-12 were consumed by other reactions, and especially by the 12C(a, y)16O

 process, nothing would have been gained. By comparing the reaction rates of the two

 processes he found that the latter must occur through a known nonresonant level at
 7. 10 MeV above the ground state of oxygen- 16, slightly less than what corresponds

 to the combined masses of carbon-12 and the alpha particle. Because the 7.10MeV
 level is just below (12C + a)=7.16MeV, resonance cannot occur.

 In this way Hoyle was able to explain how most of the carbon produced in the core

 of a giant star will still be present when the star explodes as a supernova and spreads

 its material into interstellar space. In his account of the theory, as first presented in an

 article in Astrophysical Journal of 1954, Hoyle concluded that the theory was able to

 reproduce roughly the abundance ratios between carbon-12, oxygen- 16, and neon-20,

 but only if there existed a carbon resonance level at about 7.7 MeV.39 For the ratios he
 deduced

 in good agreement with astrospectroscopic estimates. Thus, with Hoyle's new insight

 the steps in the triple alpha reaction could be written as

 where Qi = 95 keV, Q2 = 0.3 1 MeV and Q3 =7.68 MeV. The net result was

 4He + 4He + 4He -► 12C + 2y + 7.28 MeV.

 Whereas Hoyle did not calculate a reaction rate for the revised triple alpha process,
 other physicists, following up on his idea, did. Taking into regard the Hoyle reso-
 nance they found a rate equation of the same form as the one Salpeter had reported
 in 1952, but with a much larger yield. Moreover, the energy generation turned out to

 39 Hoyle (1954, p. 134). Although today recognized as a pioneering contribution to the understanding of
 stellar nucleosynthesis, Hoyle's article of 1954 was not well known and only cited by few scientists. For
 the reasons for the lack of citations to the article, see Clayton (2007a,b) and Burbidge (2008).

 Hoyle did not rush to announce his prediction, which only became known to the

 community of physicists more than half a year after it had been confirmed experimen-
 tally. His announcement took place at a meeting of the American Physical Society
 in Albuquerque in early September 1953, five months after Hoyle had left Caltech

 for a stay at Princeton University. In its brief abstract Hoyle and his three coauthors

 said that the observed cosmic abundance ratio of He:C:O could be reproduced "if the

 reaction Be8 (a, y)C12 has a resonance state near 0.31 Me V, corresponding to a level

 at 7.68 MeV in C12."41 This first presentation was actually the study of the Kellogg
 experimentalists and not Hoyle, who at the time had left Pasadena and was back at

 the University of Cambridge. According to the recollections of Ward Whaling, "We
 wrote to him [Hoyle] and said, 'We're going to publish a paper and we'd like you to

 put your name on it, too.' . . . And he acceded, since the experiment - he didn't get in

 and turn and twist the knobs and read the counters, but it was his idea, his concept,

 that led us to do it in the first place."42 A fuller account of the reactions only appeared

 in Hoyle's more extensive article in the Astwphysical Journal of 1954, in which the

 predicted excited state was not given much emphasis. In fact, Hoyle did not mention

 the prediction at all, merely citing the experimental confirmation of Whaling and his

 group.

 Since Hoyle had his office in the Kellogg Laboratory it was natural for him to
 approach Fowler and the other Kellogg experimentalists with regard to having his
 prediction confirmed. The encounter between the British theorist and the American
 experimentalists has been told in various versions. In one of the versions Fowler
 recalled:

 I was very skeptical that this steady state cosmologist, this theorist, should ask

 questions about the carbon- 12 nucleus. . . . Here was this funny little man who

 thought that we should stop all this important work that we were doing otherwise

 and look for this [resonance] state, and we gave him the brushoff. Get away from

 us, young fellow, you bother us.43

 and the Kellogg physicists.

 An anthropic myth 733

 Fowler's recollection may be more colorful than accurate. In any case, it does not

 agree with the memory of Hoyle, according to whom his request to Fowler merely

 resulted in "a long technical discussion of whether the experimental methods used thus

 far might have missed the state I was looking for."44 The Kellogg nuclear physicist
 Charles Barnes recalled the meeting in Fowler's office as follows:

 As Fred presented his ideas, it was clear that the audience was visibly skeptical.

 Even Willy seemed to be somewhat skeptical, but I don't recall that he raised any

 serious objections to the ideas, whatever he thought about them. Toward the end

 of the meeting, I recall saying that we could and should certainly check whether

 there really was an excited state in 12C near the 8Be plus alpha threshold, as Fred

 was proposing, and that Ward [Whaling] and his group . . . were in a particularly

 good position to do the measurement.45

 Whatever the details, Fowler and his team quickly took an interest in what Hoyle

 told them and prepared looking for the missing resonance. One reason may have been

 that the prediction of a resonance level at about 7.7 MeV, although unconfirmed at the

 time, was not completely unexpected.

 Thus, as early as 1940, two physicists at Cornell University had reported an energy

 level in carbon- 12 at 7.62 MeV based on measurements of the range of alpha parti-
 cles from the reaction 14N(d, a)12C, where d denotes a deuteron.46 However, later

 and more precise measurements of the same deuteron-nitrogen reaction, made by R.

 Malm and W. Buechner at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, failed to confirm

 a level at about this energy.47 On the other hand, some studies of nuclear processes

 seemed to provide evidence for a level in the area 7.0-7.5 MeV, which was included as
 a possibility in some of the level diagrams published by the Kellogg Radiation Labo-

 ratory in the early 1950s (Fig. 2).48 What matters is that by 1952 there was conflicting

 evidence in regard to the question of a carbon-12 state in the vicinity of 7.5 MeV, not

 far from the state that Hoyle needed. Hoyle was probably aware of the possibility of

 such a resonance, which may have stimulated his decision to examine the triple alpha
 process more closely. Thus, it is not quite true that the 7.68 MeV excited state was

 "contrary to all the then-known evidence," such as the standard story has it.49

 It has been suggested that Hoyle did not really predict a new energy level, but rather

 "predicted that the newly expunged level would be real," as stated by David Arnett,

 element carbon" (p. 323).

 an American astrophysicist.50 Yet, even though there was unconfirmed evidence of
 one or more resonances in the range 7.0-7.5 MeV, Hoyle's prediction did not depend
 on this evidence. Moreover, none of the experimentally suggested levels had energy

 higher than 7.5 MeV. Contrary to the uncertain and conflicting experimental evidence,
 Hoyle's prediction of the 7.68 level was sharp and definite.

 Ward Whaling had come to Caltech as a research fellow in 1949, and by 1952 he
 had joined the Kellogg group as a nuclear physicist specializing in the determination
 of energy levels in the lighter elements. Level diagrams were a specialty at the labora-

 tory, where they were worked out by Thomas Lauritsen and others. Whaling recalled

 istence of earlier reported lines of about 7 MeV.

 how Hoy le addressed him and his group with respect to the question of a carbon- 12

 resonance of the proper energy. At the time the group consisted of Whaling, William

 Wenzel, Ralph Pixley, and an Australian visitor by the name of Noel Dunbar.

 So we looked at Tommy's [Thomas Lauritsen's] level diagrams, and you could

 see that at one point somebody had penciled in a level there, but then other people

 had tried to see it, and then Tommy had erased it; it seemed not to exist. And

 its energy wasn't exactly where it needed to be, anyway, for Hoyle's purposes.
 It was close by - like 7.4, or something like that, instead of 7.6. But the idea
 immediately occurred: "Well, let's look and see if we can see such a state in
 carbon-12." . . . We decided to look at it by bombarding nitrogen-14 with deu-

 terons and looking at the alpha particle. The reaction goes to carbon-12 plus an

 alpha particle. And by looking at the energy of the alpha particles, we should

 find high-energy alpha particles that leave carbon-12 in its ground state. And

 groups of alphas of lower energy, because some of the energy was left in the
 carbon-12 residual nucleus. So we decided we would try that.51

 It will come as no surprise to historians that one has to be careful with scientists' recol-

 lections, not least when they refer to events that occurred nearly a half century earlier.
 This is illustrated by the time it took to verify Hoyle's prediction. In 2002 Barnes

 said that the experimental confirmation took "literally just a few weeks," which agrees

 roughly with Hoyle's recollection of "about ten days."52 On the other hand, in 2004

 Whaling, who was in charge of the experiment, recalled that the experiment took some

 three months.53 Further, in an earlier conversation in about 1992 Whaling said that the

 first indication of an excited carbon state near 7.7 MeV was reported in his laboratory

 notebook on 15 January 1953.54 We may probably conclude that the prediction was

 verified fairly quickly and at a time when Hoyle was still at Caltech.

 Apart from being communicated at the September 1953 meeting of the American

 Physical Society, the study of Whaling and his collaborators was published in early
 November in the Physical Review, this time without Hoyle as a coauthor.55 The reac-

 tion examined by the Kellogg physicists, that is, 14N(d, a)12C, was the same one that
 had been studied more than 20 years earlier by Holloway and Moore, but the experi-

 ment of Whaling and his group was far more accurate. They used a beam of 620-keV

 deuterons to bombard a target of nitrogen-14 in the form of frozen ammonia (NH3)

 on a cooled copper plate. The energy spectrum of the emitted alpha particles was mea-

 sured by means of a double-focusing magnetic spectrometer, a method far superior to

 the old one based on the range-energy relationship of alpha particles. Whaling's group
 found a value for the carbon resonance of 7.68 ± 0.03 MeV with a width less than

 25keV, in excellent agreement with Hoyle's calculations (Fig. 3). These calculations
 were based on astrophysical considerations, but at the time astrophysics was of no

 great interest to Whaling and his collaborators who merely expressed their indebted-

 ness "to Professor Hoyle for pointing out to us the astrophysical significance of this

 level." What this significance was they did not say.

 Further experiments reported by Fowler and his group of nuclear physicists nar-

 rowed down the carbon-12 resonance level to 7.653 ± 0.008 MeV and showed that

 the spin and parity state of the level was most likely 0+. (The ground state is also 0+,
 while the first excited level of energy 4.43 MeV is a 2+ state.) For the disintegration

 energy of beryllium-8 decaying into two alpha particles they obtained 93.7 ± 0.9 keV.

 These results were found by producing the resonance state in the beta decay of boron-

 12 to three alpha particles.56 The data found by the Kellogg physicists and other

 groups were in full agreement with Hoyle's theoretical arguments. Further, American
 physicists were not alone in investigating the Salpeter-Hoyle triple alpha process; it
 also attracted the attention of European and Japanese theorists. For example, research

 groups at the universities of Tokyo and Kyoto made detailed calculations of the new

 triple alpha process and other alpha-capturing processes in the helium cores of stars.57

 By the time Hoyle made his prediction he was not only busy with nucleosynthesis in

 the stars, he was also working on the steady-state cosmological theory that he, together
 with Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, had introduced in 1948. Indeed, he was at

 the time best known as a cosmologist and advocate of this controversial theory of the

 universe based on the hypothesis of continuous creation of matter. By its very nature,

 the steady-state theory was restricted to stellar processes when it came to explaining

 the building up of elements, and for this reason it was important to demonstrate that all

 of the elements could in fact be produced without assuming a hot primordial state of

 the universe. Although Hoyle's study in nucleosynthesis thus had a connection to his
 favored cosmological model, it was not motivated by this model or otherwise closely
 related to cosmology. In his articles on the synthesis of carbon and other elements
 Hoyle was careful not to mention the cosmological debate. This was also the case

 when he joined forces with Fowler, Margaret Burbidge, and Geoffrey Burbidge and in

 1957 published the comprehensive and soon famous study on stellar nucleosynthesis
 known colloquially as the B2HF theory.58

 Although this theory was not directly associated with steady-state cosmology, indi-

 rectly it weakened Gamow's big bang alternative and, consequently, added support to
 the steady-state view of the universe. To Bondi, the B2HF theory was a "tremendous

 triumph" for the steady-state conception of the universe.59 Even before the appearance

 of B2HF, it was realized that the study by Hoyle and others on stellar nucleosynthesis
 was of relevance to the cosmological controversy. As Gold expressed it at confer-
 ence on nuclear astrophysics held in Liège, Belgium, in 1953: "In comparing these

 two cosmological theories one finds that the theory of the original explosion loses an

 important advantage if it can be shown that the generation of heavy elements is in fact

 a current progress."60

 5 Responses to the 7.65 MeV level

 Hoyle's prediction is today recognized to be a most important contribution to the early

 understanding of the formation of elements in the stars. It is often assumed that it also
 was considered to be such in the past. The prediction and its confirmation "electri-

 fied the nuclear physics community," says Geoffrey Burbidge.61 However, this is to

 greatly overrate the early influence of the resonance level and in particular Hoyle's

 prediction of it. Taken together, the two brief articles of 1953 in which the prediction
 was announced were cited 8 times between 1953 and 1981, whereas they received 62

 citations in the period from 1982 to 2009.62 There is little doubt that these citation

 numbers reflect the increasing popularity of the anthropic principle.

 Hoyle himself does not seem to have considered the prediction as particularly

 important. He did not turn it into a scientific article in 1953, nor did he highlight it
 in his later studies. As mentioned, he appeared as coauthor of an abstract article in
 1953, but without actually contributing to the article or showing any interest in it. He

 did not cite it in his 1954 article in Astrophysical Journal nor, as far as I know, in any

 to call it a "much-cited paper" (Scerri 2007, p. 323). Salpeter's 1952 article was cited more frequently,
 54 times until 1981. It should be noted that the citation data in the ISI Web of Science are not complete.

 of his later research articles. In a survey of stellar nucleosynthesis given at the 1958
 Solvay Congress, Hoyle pointed out the significance of the second excited level in

 carbon- 12,63 but again without referring to his own role or to the 1953 abstract article.
 "He took the news of his successful prediction calmly," as Whaling recalls.64 Hoyle

 later said about the prediction and its confirmation in early 1953 that "In a sense this

 was a minor detail," adding that it had a disproportionate effect "because it was seen

 by physicists as an unusual and successful prediction."65

 The literature on nuclear physics and astrophysics in the 1950s confirms that the

 7.65-MeV level was not seen as greatly important. Not only were there few refer-

 ences to it, none of the references highlighted Hoyle's prediction as a very significant

 one. Most did not mention the prediction, but only the experimental discovery of the

 level. To the extent it was known, it was known mainly through oral presentations and

 informal discussions. Thus, at an important meeting on astrophysics at the University
 of Michigan in July 1953, Salpeter gave comprehensive lectures on the triple alpha
 process and related processes of element formation in stars. His lectures included

 discussion of the Hoyle resonance, but they were not published.66

 In September 1953 an international conference on nuclear astrophysics convened

 in Liège, attended by most American and European experts. Among the participants
 were Fowler, Greenstein, Salpeter, Bondi, Gold, Oskar Klein, Evry Schatzman, and
 Dirk ter Haar. (Hoyle was absent both in Michigan and Liège.) Only one of the arti-
 cles appearing in the conference proceedings, a survey of nucleosynthesis written
 by Greenstein, referred to Hoyle's prediction. Greenstein described the case as fol-
 lows: "Hoyle, during lectures in 1953 at the Caltech, showed that in the absence of
 nuclear resonance the rate of formation of C12 and its destruction were such that only

 over a very narrow range of temperature would the ratio C12/O16 be appreciable.
 Fortunately, unpublished study at the Kellogg Laboratory has now established that a

 low-lying nuclear resonance level exists in C12."67

 In his 1956 article with Fowler, Greenstein again pointed out the astrophysical sig-

 nificance of the resonance level, but this time without mentioning that it had its origin

 in Hoyle's prediction. The same was the case when Salpeter discussed the new version

 of the triple alpha process at an annual meeting of the American Physical Society in

 January 1955,68 and also in a more popular article he published later the same year.
 Salpeter merely said that the triple alpha process proceeds "via intermediate steps
 involving the unstable Be8 and a resonance level in C12 which was only discovered
 quite recently."69 Many physicists doing calculations on stellar nucleosynthesis in the
 1950s were simply unaware that Hoyle had made a prediction that was subsequently

 dage, Geoffrey and Margaret Burbidge, Edwin Salpeter, George Gamow, Don Osterbrock, Owen Gingerich,

 confirmed in the laboratory. Had they missed the brief abstract in the September 1953
 issue of Physical Review, they would not necessarily know about it. For example,

 a group of Japanese physicists apparently thought that the resonance level had been

 discovered experimentally first and then Hoyle had understood its significance in the

 triple alpha process: "Since a level of 12C at 7.68 MeV and some properties of other
 nuclei were observed, Hoyle tried to calculate the reaction rates . . ., taking into account

 the resonance capture."70

 In short, there is no evidence that the discovery of the Hoyle resonance "electrified"

 either the nuclear physics or the astrophysics community. Although it was known and

 appreciated by experts in nucleosynthesis, its origin as a theoretical prediction attracted

 little attention or was simply unknown. That only changed later.

 6 Hoyle on cosmic fine tuning

 Hoyle's argument that there must exist a resonance state in carbon- 12 at an energy of
 about 7.7 MeV was a brilliant prediction based on astrophysical reasoning, and one

 that deservedly occupies a prominent place in the history of astrophysics. But history

 is one thing, folklore another. Was it an anthropic prediction? In his biography of
 Fred Hoyle, Simon Mitton notes that "A certain amount of folklore now surrounds

 the experiment [of Whaling et al.] and Hoyle's role." While this is certainly correct,

 unfortunately Mitton adds to the folklore in his account of how Hoyle motivated his
 interest in the resonance to his colleagues at Caltech:

 After studying Salpeter's paper in the Astrophysical Journal, Hoyle was not
 prepared to let the matter rest. . . . Fred said to his associates, "Since we are
 surrounded by carbon in the natural world and we ourselves are carbon-based
 life, the stars must have discovered a highly effective way of making it, and I

 am going to look for it."71

 Another biographer of Hoyle, Jane Gregory, tells basically the same story. Referring

 to Hoyle's thoughts in 1953, she says: "Hoyle thought that since human beings exist

 to ask such questions about the universe - and they exist in their particular biological

 form because carbon exists in plenty - then the universe must be one in which carbon
 is readily made."72 However, there is no documentary evidence at all (at least none

 that I know of) that Hoyle expressed himself in this or some similar anthropic way, nor

 that he originally thought along such a line. The two biographies, both well researched

 and solidly documented, repeat the anthropic myth.

 Whether or not Hoyle himself came to believe that he had found evidence for

 anthropic fine-tuning in 1953, he did not originally see it in that way. Hoyle might
 have reasoned something like this: "Since life is known to exist, and life as we know

 it is carbon based, there must be a way to produce carbon in the stars. Consequently,

 . . . there must exist a 7.68 MeV resonance." This is what many sources, including the

 two biographies mentioned above, claim or at least imply. In that case his reasoning

 would have counted as an anthropic prediction. But this was not the way Hoyle argued
 in 1953. In his autobiography of 1994, entitled Home Is Where the Wind Blows,

 Hoyle said that the prediction caused him to contemplate the question of whether the
 existence of life might be due to coincidences in nuclear physics. Perhaps, he said,

 "life would perforce exist only where the nuclear adjustments happened to be favor-

 able, removing the need for arbitrary coincidences, just as one finds in the modern
 formulation of the WAP."73 He also spoke of the prediction as "an early application

 of what is known nowadays as the anthropic principle."74 We are not told when he

 began thinking along these lines, but as mentioned there is no evidence to suggest that

 such anthropic-like thoughts motivated his prediction. Instead of speculating of what

 he might have thought, it is more fruitful to look at how Hoyle expressed himself in

 his published studies relating to the prediction and the anthropic principle.

 In the early publications on the carbon resonance, neither Hoyle nor others men-

 tioned it as a case of fine-tuning, nor did they refer to the existence of life in the

 universe. A lecture given in 1957 in the University Church, Cambridge, on the rela-

 tionship between science and religion might have provided an opportunity for Hoyle

 to make the connection, but in fact he did not. Hoyle discussed the possibility that "the

 laws of nuclear physics are designed to promote the origin of the complex atoms, so it

 may well emerge . . . that the laws seem as if they have also been deliberately designed

 to promote the origin of life." He went on to say: "Life demands highly special phys-
 ical conditions if it is to flourish. Hence if life is part of a deliberate plan so must

 the origin of the physical conditions be."75 Although Hoyle found the hypothesis of

 specially designed fine-tuning appealing, he did not clearly support it. What is more,

 he did not refer to his earlier calculation of the carbon- 12 resonance as a case in point.

 As far as I know, Hoyle first referred to life in connection with the nuclear processes

 generating carbon and oxygen in a book of 1965, where he offered an account of the

 delicate balance of the energy levels in beryllium-8, carbon-12, and oxygen-16. "The

 whole balance of the elements carbon and oxygen is critical not only for the chemistry

 of living organisms but for the distribution of the planets," he said.76 He continued:

 If carbon were more abundant than oxygen it would be inevitable, I think, that a

 big graphite planet would lie nearest to the sun

 ably placed resonance in the C12 nucleus, the rate of carbon production would
 be so slow that very little carbon would exist in the world; the opposite to the

 graphite planet situation. . . . When we examine the O16 nucleus we see that a

 level exists very close to the sum of the rest masses of C12 and an a-particle, but

 fortunately the level is below, so that an actual resonance can never occur. I say

 75 Hoyle (1957, p. 65). Another contribution to the lecture series was given by Charles Pantin, a British
 zoologist who is sometimes mentioned as an early advocate of anthropic reasoning and the idea of multiple
 universes; see Barrow and Tipler (1986, p. 250).

 fortunately, because if there was little carbon in the world compared to oxygen,

 it is likely that living creatures would never have developed.

 At the end of his book Hoyle returned to the question of whether the placing of the

 energy levels in carbon- 12 and nitrogen- 16 was fortuitous or not:

 It could simply be that since creatures like ourselves depend on a balance between

 carbon and oxygen, we can exist only in the portions of the universe where these

 levels happen to be correctly placed. In other places the level in O16 might be

 a little higher, so that the addition of a -particles to C12 was highly resonant. In

 such a place oxygen would be overwhelmingly more abundant than carbon, and
 creatures like ourselves could not exist.77

 While Hoyle did not think anthropically in 1953, his above speculations of 1965
 can well be seen as an anticipation of the anthropic principle. In a textbook published

 10 years later Hoyle repeated his idea, adding the speculation that the balance between

 the electromagnetic and nuclear forces (and hence the energy levels) might "vary from

 one region of the universe to other, very distant regions."78 In that case, life as we know

 it would only form in some cosmic regions, evidently in our own and possibly only in

 ours. In neither of the publications did Hoyle connect his study of 1953 with anthropic

 considerations, either in the sense that he singled out intelligent life or suggested that

 his earlier study was anthropically motivated.

 At the latest by 1980 Hoyle was aware of the anthropic principle, such as expounded

 in the article by Carr and Rees in Nature of 1979. He apparently now conceived his

 prediction of 1953 as related to anthropic reasoning. "Is the positioning of the level at
 7.65 MeV in 12C an accident?" he asked. "Is it an accident that the 7.12MeV level of

 16O lies just below the sum of the rest masses of 12C and 4He? Without these circum-
 stances together, the cosmic ratio of C to O would not be appropriate to life, which
 demands approximately equal abundances for these two crucial elements."79 By the
 early 1980s Hoyle was sometimes associating his prediction of the 7.65 MeV level
 with the anthropic principle, but not in any explicit sense. For example, in 1982 he

 spoke of the energy levels of carbon- 12 and oxygen- 16 as a "put-up job" apparently

 designed to produce the two elements in the right ratio. "A common sense interpreta-

 tion of the facts suggests," he said, "that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics,

 as well as chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking

 about in nature."80 He did not specifically refer to life, whether human or not.

 Although Hoyle was at that time intensely occupied with the nature and origin of

 life, he did not endorse the anthropic principle in any of its ordinary meanings and
 neither did he find it to be of much use for cosmology. As he saw it, the significance
 of the principle lay elsewhere. In an address at the first Venice Conference on Cos-

 mology and Philosophy in 1987, he gave a review of his ideas of the relations between

 79 Hoyle (1980, pp. 54-55). Hoyle also mentioned a few other instances of fine-tuning, referring to Carr
 and Rees (1979) for "a fuller compilation of these 'anthropic' issues."

 cosmology and biology in front of Carter, Sciama, Barrow, George Ellis, and other
 leading cosmologists. He emphasized that the key problem was how to explain the
 origin of life. According to Hoyle's reasoning, it was extremely implausible that life
 on Earth could have occurred by chance, which "seems to me [to] be the essence of

 the anthropic principle" As to this principle, he turned it upside down:

 Until we understand it [the origin of life], much, I believe, will remain to be dis-

 covered about cosmology, for surely the occurrence of life is the largest problem
 of which we are aware. It is not so much that the Universe must be consistent

 742 H. Kragh

 with us as that we must be consistent with the Universe. The anthropic principle

 has the problem inverted, in my opinion.81

 This is a version of the anthropic principle quite different from the one formulated by
 Carter and subsequently developed by a host of other physicists, cosmologists, and
 philosophers. At the following Venice conference, dedicated to the anthropic principle

 and taking place in 1989, Hoyle apparently adopted the strong principle, but it was in

 a version quite different from the usual one. "If our existence leads to a potentially fal-

 sifiable prediction in the sense of Popper," Hoyle said, "then I take it that the anthropic

 principle is being employed in its strong mode."82 He might have referred to his early

 prediction of the carbon- 12 resonance as an example, but did not. Instead he derived

 a prediction from "the immense biochemical complexity of life" concerning the spec-

 trum of the microwave background, which he considered "an example of a prediction

 from the strong anthropic principle relating the basic issue of the origin of life to the

 basic form of cosmology."83 This basic form of cosmology was the steady-state theory

 of the universe, which according to Hoyle was in harmony with and indeed favoured

 by anthropic considerations. While Hoyle avoided connecting his 1953 prediction
 with the anthropic principle, at the same conference the French astrophysicist Hubert
 Reeves made the connection. Maintaining that the anthropic principle could result in

 predictions made from a posteriori considerations, he mentioned Hoyle's prediction
 as an example.84

 Given that the standard view was and presumably still is that the anthropic prin-

 ciple rules out the steady-state universe and other cosmological theories operating

 with an infinite past,85 Hoyle's argument at the second Venice conference underlines
 the unorthodox nature of his conception of the anthropic principle. The general argu-
 ment that the existence of life in the universe can be understood on the basis of the

 anthropic principle in conjunction with a revised steady-state theory (rather than big
 bang cosmology) also appeared in the book, Life on Mars?, that Hoyle wrote with
 his long-time collaborator and former student Chandra Wickramasinghe. The two

 the anthropic principle. On the contrary, the two notions are generally seen as contradictory.

 83 What is sometimes known as the Davies-Tipler argument is an alleged refutation of cosmological theo-
 ries with an infinite past, including the steady-state theory, on the basis of the SAP; see Davies (1978) and
 Barrow and Tipler (1986, pp. 601-608).

 astronomers argued that access to superastronomical masses of carbonaceous matter

 is to be needed to get life started, and that this favoured the new quasi-steady-state

 cosmology (QSSC) over the big bang theory of the universe.86

 Hoy le now referred to the weak and strong forms of the anthropic principle in ver-

 sions that were more in line with those adopted by most other authors. He suggested

 that the strong version was of little or no scientific value - it might be nothing but "a

 semantic substitute for teleology." On the other hand, he and Wickramasinghe con-
 sidered the WAP - that "the universe must be consistent with the existence of life, and

 in particular with the existence of human life" - to be both testable and scientifically
 valuable. They explicitly described Hoyle's early prediction as a deduction from the

 anthropic principle:

 The weak anthropic principle serves to remove otherwise inexplicable cosmic

 coincidences by the circumstance of our own existence. One of the present writ-

 ers [Hoyle] was involved in an early application of the weak anthropic principle.
 ... It was shown in 1952-53 that to understand how carbon and oxygen could be

 produced in approximately equal abindances, as they are in living systems, it was
 necessary for the nucleus of 12C to possess an excited state close to 7.65 MeV

 above ground level. No such state was known at the time of this deduction but a

 state at almost exactly the predicted excitation was found shortly thereafter. So

 one could say that this was an example of using the weak anthropic principle in

 order to deduce the way the world must be, although the concept of the anthropic

 principle had not been explicitly formulated at that time.87

 Thus, Hoyle finally came to the conclusion that his 1953 prediction was a case of

 anthropic reasoning, or rather that it could be understood as anthropic in ^postfactum

 sense. But it took him about 40 years, and he never suggested that his motivations for

 the prediction were related to the existence of life in the universe. Nonetheless, Wickra-

 masinghe later maintained that the WAP was "pioneered by Hoyle in the 1950s" when
 he "deduced that the nucleus of 12C must possess an excited state close to 7.65 MeV

 above ground state."88

 7 A case of anthropic prediction?

 I have shown that Hoyle's famous prediction of the 7.65 MeV resonance state was
 not originally thought of in terms of anthropic fine-tuning, neither by Hoyle him-

 self nor by other researchers involved in stellar nucleosynthesis. The early literature

 related to the anthropic principle did not refer to the prediction of 1953 as an example

 of anthropic reasoning, although it would have been tempting to use the case in the

 86 The QSSC model, introduced in 1993 by Hoyle, Narlikar, and Geoffrey Burbidge, has no beginning in
 time, but contrary to the classical steady-state theory it expands in a cyclic pattern and for this reason does

 not satisfy the perfect cosmological principle on which the steady-state model was originally based; see
 Hoyle (1993) and Kragh (1996, pp. 385-388) for a summary description.

 87 Hoyle and Wickramasinghe (1999, pp. 89-90). The article, which first appeared as a preprint in 1991,
 was also published as a chapter in Hoyle and Wickramasinghe (1997).

 controversy that began to evolve at the time. Proponents of the anthropic principle

 were painfully aware of its lack of predictivity; yet, they ignored the one case that
 would soon be regarded as an exception. For example, in 1982 Can* emphasized how

 much more impressive it would be "if the Anthropic Principle could be used io predict

 a coincidence," regretting that "so far this has not been done."89 Like all astrophysi-

 cists at the time, Can* was aware of Hoyle's prediction, and yet, he did not think of it

 as anthropic. Nor did Can* and Rees in their article of 1979.

 To further illustrate this point, consider an important article that the Princeton phys-

 icist Robert Dicke published in 1961 and which is generally regarded as one of the

 main sources for the anthropic principle. Dicke discussed how "the biological require-

 ments to be met during the epoch of man" constrained cosmological knowledge, and
 in this context he mentioned that heavier elements must have been produced in the

 stars. "It is well known that carbon is required to make physicists," as he phrased it.90

 Had Dicke seen Hoyle's mechanism of carbon generation as connected to human life,

 it would have been natural to refer to it as his prediction. Again, Dicke did not make

 the connection. Only from about 1984 was the case reconstructed to be an anthropic

 prediction, and it became common to associate Hoyle's reasoning with the existence

 of life in the universe. Apparently Hoy le came to share this view. It was also only from

 this time that the case became well known outside the small community of nuclear

 astrophysicists.

 There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes an anthropic prediction,

 a concept which is used in diverse and loose ways. In an article of 1994, the philos-
 opher John Leslie defined anthropic predictions as "predictions encouraged by the

 anthropic principle, even if not dictated by it," adding that such predictions might well
 be made before Carter formulated and named the principle.91 This is a reasonable

 definition, but it is much less reasonable to exemplify it by Hoyle's "two dramatically

 successful anthropic predictions" of the carbon- 12 resonance and the nonresonant
 state in oxygen- 16. Hoyle's use of the nonresonant 7.1 MeV level in oxygen was not

 in fact a prediction - since the level was known at the time - but by Leslie's definition

 Hoyle must have been encouraged by anthropic considerations to make his prediction
 of the 7.65 MeV state. Indeed, Leslie maintains that "'anthropic' considerations did

 influence him," quoting from Hoyle that "we can exist only in the portions of the
 universe where those levels happen to be correctly placed."92 But this is a quotation
 from 1965, twelve years after the prediction! Only if Hoyle had said something along

 this line in 1953 (which he did not) might it be taken as evidence that he was anthrop-

 ically encouraged. Unfortunately, this kind of careless use of historical sources is not

 exceptional among philosophers, scientists, and science writers.

 I shall here take "anthropic prediction" to mean that if a property or phenomenon

 of nature is (i) inferred from or inspired by the existence of (intelligent) life in the

 universe, and if (ii) the property or phenomenon is unknown at the time of prediction,

 then it qualifies as an anthropic prediction. If the second condition is not employed, a

 great variety of inferences will have to be accepted as anthropic. The same is true for

 the second condition: it is not enough that a prediction can be reconstructed as relating

 to the existence of life, the relation must actually enter into the prediction. If it can be

 shown that advanced life depends crucially upon a predicted property, but this played

 no role in the prediction, one should not speak of an anthropic prediction, but rather

 of an anthropically relevant or significant property.

 For example, in 1931 Paul Dirac predicted the existence of positrons on the basis

 of relativistic quantum mechanics, and much later these particles turned out to play an

 important part in the early universe. It can thus be argued that had positrons not existed,

 neither would we. It is obviously unreasonable to call Dirac's prediction anthropic for
 this reason alone. As we have seen, Hoyle's prediction was novel but not based on

 considerations of life. Although the existence of the resonance state may be said to be

 anthropically significant (like Dirac's prediction may in principle be said to be), the

 prediction was no more anthropic than Dirac's prediction of the positron.

 While there is no doubt that Hoyle's prediction was not initially conceived as

 anthropic, it may still be argued that it nonetheless was anthropic. One may argue,

 contrary to what I have suggested, that Hoyle's own motivations and the entire history

 of the case are irrelevant for deciding whether it is anthropic in nature. Although such

 a position is foreign to a historian's mind, for the sake of argument I shall grant it as

 legitimate. According to this line of thought, what matters is solely if the predicted

 state is actually a necessary condition for the existence of intelligent life. If the answer
 is yes, the prediction was anthropic, irrespective of how Hoyle and contemporary

 scientists thought about it.

 More recent investigations of the energy levels in carbon and oxygen have to some

 extent been inspired by considerations of this sort, that is, there have been attempts to

 establish how finely tuned for life the levels really are. Are they really of anthropic sig-

 nificance? Of course, Hoyle's prediction refers only to the existence of carbon atoms,

 not to human beings. Had humans or other intelligent life forms not evolved, it would

 not have changed the prediction one iota (but then, of course, the prediction would not

 have been made!). For this reason, it has sometimes been objected that it cannot pos-

 sibly be anthropic in any strict sense. However, this is hardly a valid objection, since it

 is generally acknowledged that the term "anthropic principle" is a misnomer: it does

 not refer specifically to humans, but is a selection principle that requires the universe

 and its history to be consistent with the conditions that are necessary for our exis-

 tence as observers. Ten years after having introduced the anthropic principle, Carter
 regretted having suggested the term, which he now preferred to call the "self-selection
 principle."93

 In a series of "experiments" in the form of computer calculations Mario Livio and

 his colleagues Dave Hollowell, Achim Weiss, and James W. Truran investigated in
 1989 how changes in the carbon- 12 resonance would affect the production of carbon

 in the stars. Using updated values for Hoyle's 0+ resonance (7.644 Me V) and its place
 above the sum of the energies of beryllium-8 and helium-4 (277 keV), they tested the

 consequences of a hypothetical change in the energy difference. Livio and his col-
 laborators reported that, in the case of helium burning in the core of a massive star

 some 20 times as heavy as the Sun, the difference between the two energies could be

 increased by 60keV without destroying the consistency with the observed abundance

 of carbon and oxygen. If the 7.644 level were lowered by 60keV, it turned out that the

 yield of carbon would increase markedly.

 Relating their results to the anthropic principle, Livio and colleagues pointed out

 that the 60keV shift represents a significant fraction of the energy difference between
 the 7.644 level and the (8Be + a) energy. Hence their conclusion: "Thus, we believe

 that at least some formulations of the SAP, which is based on the necessity of having

 the 0+ level exactly where it is, is weakened significantly by our results."94 In agree-

 ment with this conclusion, Steven Weinberg has observed that what affects carbon

 production in the stars is not really the Hoyle resonance level of about 7.65 MeV, but

 the energy difference of roughly 0.25 MeV between the excited state and the state of

 the (8Be + ce) system at rest. "This energy misses being too high for the production

 of carbon by a fractional amount of 0.05 MeV/0.25 MeV, or 20 percent, which is not
 such a close call after all."95

 Later and more sophisticated calculations in the same tradition, but focusing on

 slight variations in the strong interactions keeping the nucléons together, have led to
 results that to some extent differ from those of Livio and his collaborators. In a series

 of studies Heinz Oberhummer and colleagues have calculated the sensitivity of the
 location of the resonance level to the strength of the nucleon-nucleon interaction,

 finding that even a small change in the strength (about 0.5%) will make carbon-based

 life impossible.96 The helium in the stars will be transformed into either carbon or

 oxygen, but not into both elements. This and similar study has strengthened the case

 for fine-tuning somewhat, yet without unambiguously confirming the anthropic sig-

 nificance of the Hoyle resonance level. It is presumably a matter of taste how finely
 tuned for life a coincidence has to be in order to qualify as anthropic. As Livio and

 colleagues remarked in their 1989 article, the implications for evaluating the anthropic

 principle "are not entirely free from subjective feelings."97

 Rather than focusing on the degree of fine-tuning, one may deny the anthropic

 nature of Hoyle's prediction by arguing that it has nothing to do with the existence of
 life. This is what Lee Smolin, an outspoken critic of string theory and the anthropic

 principle, has done. As he argues, the fact that we and other living beings are crucially

 made of carbon compounds is unnecessary for the argument, which is really nothing

 al.f see Klee (2002); and for a critique of Klee's arguments, see Walker and Čirkovič (2003). It is noteworthy
 that while Livio et al. and also Carter related the case of the carbon- 12 resonance to the SAP, in the 1990s

 Hoyle saw it as an example of the weak form of the principle.

 Review of Books ; 21 October 1999, pp. 46-48. Weinberg (2007) confirms that he does not consider the
 Hoyle resonance as evidence for anthropic fine tuning.

 but a deduction from observed facts and the known laws of physics.98 In the anthropic

 version - not to be confused with Hoyle's authentic version - the argument starts with

 the observation that life can only exist if carbon is plentiful in the universe. But this

 observation is redundant; it plays no role in the logic that leads to the prediction. Let

 us imagine, says Smolin, the counterfactual scenario that Hoyle's prediction had been

 falsified rather than verified by experiments. In that case, would we have concluded

 that carbon is not essential to life? Surely not; we might conclude that there was some-

 thing wrong with our model of the triple alpha process, that carbon was not necessarily

 produced in stars alone, or even that our knowledge of stellar composition and the laws

 of nuclear physics needed to be reconsidered. The carbon-life connection would never
 be questioned.

 8 Conclusion

 Fred Hoyle's prediction of the 7.65-MeV resonance state in carbon-12 was a remark-

 able inference from astrophysics to nuclear structure, the first of its kind, and it had a

 significant effect on the later development of stellar nucleosynthesis and other branches

 of astrophysics. In following the history of the event I have pointed out that the exis-

 tence of an excited state in this region was already suggested by some earlier experi-

 ments, but that Hoyle's prediction nonetheless counts as a novel prediction of a nuclear

 phenomenon. I have also suggested that the prediction was not seen as highly important

 in the 1950s, neither by Hoyle himself nor by contemporary physicists and astrono-

 mers. Contrary to the folklore version of the prediction story, Hoyle did not originally

 connect it with the existence of life. It is hardly the case that "Hoyle's successful pre-

 diction sparked a resurgence of interest in the old Design Argument," such as claimed
 by Barrow." If it did, it was a much delayed spark.100 The popular association with

 the anthropic principle is of a later date and has no basis in historical fact, something

 many authors seem to be unaware of or just do not care about. The anthropic myth, as

 I have called it, is widely considered a story that ought to be true, even if it is not - and

 it is not. Not only did the case not figure in the anthropic literature until the early

 1980s, Hoyle himself did not conceive it as anthropic until about that time.

 I conclude that from a historical point of view it is misleading to label the prediction

 of the 7.65 MeV state anthropic or to use it as an example of the predictive power of the

 anthropic principle. Whether the principle has such power remains a contested issue,

 but this more general question is beyond the scope of this article. Admitting that there

 is a certain arbitrariness in the notion of anthropic prediction, I have argued that it can

 1UU Owing to its connection to fine-tuning and design arguments, Hoyle's prediction often turns up in
 religious contexts. Thus, in a defense of natural theology, Owen Gingerich, an astronomer and historian of
 science, says: "Hoyle predicted that there must be something special about the carbon nucleus, . . . some-
 thing that would account for the high abundance of carbon in the universe." He adds: "I am told that Fred

 Hoyle said that nothing shook his atheism as much as this discovery." (Gingerich 2006, p. 57).

 best be understood in a historical sense. Even if Hoyle's prediction is considered from

 an ahistorical point of view, there are reasons to doubt its anthropic nature.
