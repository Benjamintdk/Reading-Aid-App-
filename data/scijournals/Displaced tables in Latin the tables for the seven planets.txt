 Abstract The anonymous set of astronomical tables preserved in Paris, Bibliotheque
 nationale de France, MS lat. 10262, is the first set of displaced tables to be found in
 a medieval Latin text. These tables are a reworking of the standard Alfonsine tables

 and yield the same results. However, the mean motions are defined differently, the
 presentation of the tables is unprecedented, and some new functions are introduced
 for computing true planetary longitudes. The absence of any instructions as well as
 unusual technical terms in the headings make it difficult to appreciate the cleverness
 that went into the construction of these tables that are extant in a unique copy. In this

 article we provide a detailed analysis of these tables and their underlying parameters.

 The displaced tables are typical of a pervasive tendency
 in Islamic science to provide extensive and elegant
 numerical tables for the convenience of practitioners.
 The underlying astronomical theory is neither

 questioned nor affected.'

 1 Introduction

 In 2012 we published A Survey of European Astronomical Tables in the Late Middle

 Ages in which we discussed a wide range of tables, many of which were previously

 known. In this monograph we mentioned an unusual set of tables, whose significance

 had not been appreciated hitherto, that depends on a principle of displacement to elim

 inate subtractions in the course of computing planetary positions. This principle was
 employed in some zijes in the Islamic world, but until now there was nothing compa

 rable in the Latin West. As we will see, this set of tables is a most ingenious reworking

 of the Parisian Alfonsine Tables, rather than a translation of an Arabic zij (where the

 term zij is used in Arabic to refer to a set of astronomical tables with instructions for
 their use). What makes this set of tables so unusual is that, for example, the mean
 planetary motions are defined differently from those in the standard Alfonsine tables,

 and some of the functions for computing true planetary longitudes from their mean

 motions also differ noticeably from those in the standard Alfonsine tables; neverthe
 less, computation with these displaced tables yield the same results as computation

 with the standard Alfonsine tables. Moreover, the tables for first station are presented
 in a completely different way from those we have seen in the Ptolemaic tradition,

 although the underlying parameters are unchanged. Given the absence of instructions,
 it was not an easy task to unravel the cleverness of the construction of these tables. We

 had some helpful guidance from a paper by Kennedy (1977), but it was not sufficient

 for uncovering various subtleties in these tables for which there are no counterparts in
 the tables that Kennedy analyzed.

 Paris, Bibliotheque nationale de France, MS lat. 10262, is a fifteenth-century
 manuscript containing two sets of astronomical tables: an anonymous set for 1340
 (ff. 2r-46v); and another set, called Tabule frequentine (ff. 47v-71r), composed by
 Melchion de Friquento of Naples in 1438 (f. 46v: 1437 completus).2 Neither set has
 previously been examined. In this paper we focus on the first set, entirely composed
 of tables with no accompanying text. At the bottom of the last table (f. 46v), we read:
 Expliciunt tabule de septem planetis et de veris locis eius (Here end the tables for
 the seven planets and their true positions). Therefore, we shall refer to this set as the
 Tables for the Seven Planets (where the Sun and the Moon are considered planets).
 The yearly tables begin in March, and we are told that the tables are valid for 1340

 completus, or 1340 (complete), meaning that the epoch is noon of February 28, 1341,

 the last day of the year, counting from March 1, 1340.3

 The name of the author of these tables is not given in the manuscript, and no local
 ity is mentioned. However, on f. 9r, at the bottom of a table for the mean motion of

 the Sun, we are told that the radix for the Sun, anno domini 1340 completo, is 8s
 16;41,49° (=256;41,49°). In contrast to the use of physical signs of 60° in the Parisian

 2 For a description of this manuscript, see Thorndike (1957), especially pp. 144-145. Richard L. Kremer

 informs us that he is preparing a study of the Tabule frequentine, tentatively called "Melchion de Friquento's
 eclipse tables of 1437, a revised Latin version of Immanuel Bonfils's Six Wings".

 3 The last day of February belongs to 1340 according to the convention of this text (in fact, it is the last day

 of that year), but to 1341 according to our modern convention (it is the 59th day of this year). The same
 convention applies to all subsequent years in this text. Note also that the common astronomical practice in
 the Middle Ages was to take noon as the beginning of the day.

 Displaced tables in Latin

 Alfonsine Tables (PAT), we note the use here of zodiacal signs of 30°. If we compute

 the mean motion of the Sun using the PAT for Toledo, we find its mean longitude to be
 346;20,53° and its mean argument of center, 256;43,54°.4 Therefore, the given radix
 refers to the mean argument of center of the Sun. The difference in the mean argument

 of center, 0;2,5°, is the amount traveled by the Sun in about 0;50h, which corresponds
 to a difference in geographical longitude of about 12;40° east of Toledo. This figure

 agrees, although not exactly, with the longitude of the meridian of Paris, taken as 12;0°

 east of Toledo in many astronomical tables of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.5

 The Tables for the Seven Planets give multiple examples of displaced tables. A
 table is said to be displaced with respect to another when its entries are the same as

 those in the standard table after adding a constant to its argument (horizontal displace

 ment), or derive from the entries in the standard table by adding a constant (vertical
 displacement). This can also be expressed in algebraic terms: if y = fix) is the func
 tion underlying a given table, then the function embedded in the displaced table is
 y = f (x + kh), for a displacement on the X-axis, or y = /'(x) + kv, for a displace
 ment on the Y-axis. Of course, both displacements can occur at the same time, leading
 to an equation such as

 y = f(x + kh) + kv. (1)

 The purpose of displaced tables is to avoid subtractions, that is, the use of complicated
 rules for handling negative numbers before they were available to astronomers who
 computed planetary positions by means of astronomical tables.6

 This problem was already felt by astronomers in the ninth century, who called the
 standard table asli and the displaced table wad0!.1 Displaced tables were clever com
 putational devices, with implications for the method of computation of astronomical
 quantities, but did not challenge either the parameters or the models on which the
 original tables were based. Kennedy (1977) presented an explanation of displaced
 planetary tables in the medieval Islamic world, and demonstrated the equivalence of
 computations using one such set with computations using Ptolemy's tables. Kennedy
 focused on the tables of Ibn al-Aclam (d. 985) and called attention to the fundamen
 tal relation of three displacements for each planet (see Eq. 26, below).8 Byzantine
 astronomers apparently depended on their Muslim predecessors for displaced tables:

 4 According to this computation, 89;36,59° is the longitude of the solar apogee, A a , which is the difference

 between the solar longitude and the solar mean argument of center at a given time.

 5 See, e.g., Kremerand Dobrzycki (1998).

 6 It is important to distinguish between displaced tables and shifted tables. A shifted table contains the
 same information as the standard table (the same columns and rows, and the same entries) but the first row

 is not that for argument 0° or 1° but for some other convenient number, to stress the fact that the entry

 reaches a specific value such as a maximum or a minimum for that particular value of the argument. Shifts

 occur, for instance, for the planetary latitudes of certain planets in John of Murs's Tables of 1321 (Chabas
 and Goldstein 2009, see esp. pp. 308-309).

 7 Salam and Kennedy (1967, p. 497). See also Debarnot (1987, p. 43 (Table 9)) and Jensen (1971).

 8 Displaced tables in Islamic astronomy are also discussed in Jensen (1971), Saliba (1976), Saliba (1977),
 Mercier (1989), and Van Brummelen (1998). For displaced tables in the Maghrib, see Samso and Millas
 (1998), and Samso (2003).

 seeTihon (1977-1981, espec. 68:76 and 110). As far as we can determine, none of the
 displaced tables compiled by astronomers in the Islamic World and Byzantium were
 known in the West. Two Jewish astronomers in Provence, Levi ben Gerson (d. 1344)

 and Immanuel ben Jacob Bonfils of Tarascon (fl. 1350), composed zijes in Hebrew in

 which they used the principle of displaced tables for the times and longitudes of syz

 ygies (but not for the motion of the planets); however, there is no evidence to suggest

 that they depended on Islamic or Byzantine sources.9 In astronomy written in Latin

 the tables described here are the first to use displaced tables systematically, although
 we know of an earlier use of this type of table by John Vimond around 1320, limited

 to his table for trepidation (or "access and recess").10

 As mentioned above, the Tables for the Seven Planets have no accompanying text;

 therefore, the following comments are based entirely on the information provided by
 the tables themselves. As will be seen, the terminology in these tables often differs

 from that commonly used at the time, and many of the tables have a presentation that

 diverges from other tables with the same parameters that are based on the same model.

 There follows a table of contents, arranged by section number.

 an adaptation of Bonfils's tables, where displaced tables occur.

 Displaced tables in Latin

 2 Multiplication table

 The first table in this manuscript (ff. 2r-7v) is a multiplication table for base 60 arith
 metic, with entries for each integer from 1 to 60. This table, presented as a 60 x 60
 square matrix, is quite common in manuscripts containing sets of astronomical tables
 (see, e. g., Chabas and Goldstein 2012, p. 227). The fact that f. 8r-v is blank makes
 it uncertain if this multiplication table belongs to the set examined here, for it could

 very well have been inserted by the copyist to facilitate computation.

 3 Mean motion of the Sun

 Folio 9r contains five tables for the mean motion of the Sun. The first lists the Radices

 ad 32 annos post annum 1340, i.e., the values of the mean motion of the Sun at the

 beginning of each year for a period of 32 consecutive years. The entry for year 1 is 8s

 16;26,51°, and it corresponds to the mean argument of center of the Sun at noon of

 February 28, 1342; the entry for year 32 is 8s 16;36,12°. It should be emphasized that

 a period of 32 years for the motion of the Sun is very unusual; in any case, we have
 not found it in the previous literature, where periods of 20, 24, and 28 abound (see
 Chabas and Goldstein 2012, p. 54). We also note that the usual phrase anni expansi

 (expanded years, that is, those within a cycle, in contrast to anni collecti for the years

 at the interval of a cycle) does not appear here or in the headings of the other tables.

 The other four tables for the Sun have a general title, beginning Tabula porcionis

 solis ad annos radicum..., where porcio has to be understood here as "argument of cen

 ter".1 1 The second table on this folio gives the mean motion of the Sun for accumulated

 months; its first entry corresponds to March (Is 0;33,18°) and the last one to February

 (lis 29:45,39°). These entries agree exactly with those given by John of Ligneres in
 his Tabule magne for a year beginning in January (see Chabas and Goldstein 2012,
 Table 5.1B, pp. 55-56), who also used zodiacal signs of 30°. The third table is headed
 ad annos perpetuacionis, from 1372 to 1852, at 32-year intervals, and again we see

 the use of non-standard terminology, for the phrase anni collecti is totally absent from

 this set of tables. The fourth and fifth tables are, respectively, for the mean motion of
 the Sun for days from 1 to 31, and for hours and fractions of an hour from 1 to 60.

 The entry for argument Id is 0s 0;59,8°.

 As mentioned above, at the bottom of the folio we are told that the Radix porcionis
 solis ad anno domini 1340 completo is 8s 16;41,49°. From this value and the entry
 for year 32 (8s 16;36,12°) we derive a mean motion in the argument of center of
 0;59,8,13,32,49°/d. As indicated previously, the entries in these tables represent the

 '' We know of no prior usage of porcio for the argument of center of the Sun. There are, however, examples

 where it means "anomaly" in the case of the planets. On porcio (or portio) in the sense of "anomaly", see
 Goldstein et al. (1994, pp. 63-64) (see also Nallino 1903-1907, vol 2, p. 328), where a reference is given
 to John of Ligneres's use of this word in the canons to his tables, whose incipit is Priores astrologi motus

 corporum celestium(\?>22). The Arabic for anomaly \shissa, which means "portion" and one of the Hebrew

 terms for anomaly, manah, also means "portion". Both the Latin and Hebrew terms apparently come from

 Arabic. The fact that in our text the argument of center of the Sun is considered the "anomaly" indicates that

 the author had in mind an epicyclic model for the Sun, which is equivalent to the eccentric model according
 to Apollonius's theorem (see Almagest III.3; Toomer 1984, pp. 141-153).

 mean argument of center of the Sun, k, and this is another peculiar characteristic of
 the Tables for the Seven Planets, because in other sets the mean solar motion, that is,

 X, is usually tabulated. The two quantities are related by means of Xa , the longitude of
 the solar apogee, for X = H + A small table, found later in the text (f. 17r), gives
 the motion of the solar apogee. It is entitled Motus augium equatus and the entries are

 yearly values, probably corrected for precession. The entry for 32 year is 0; 19,42,35°,
 which implies a daily motion of 0;0,0,6,4°/d. By adding this value to the one derived

 for the mean motion in the argument of center of the Sun, the result is 0;59,8,19,37°/d,

 in good agreement both with the value used by Vimond (0;59,8,19,37,4°/d) and the
 value in the PAT (0;59,8,19,37,19,13,56°/d) for the mean solar motion in longitude.12

 It would thus seem that the Tables for the Seven Planets belong to this tradition. We

 will show that the rest of the tables provide additional evidence of this relationship.

 4 Solar equation

 The solar equation is given on ff. 9v-10r. The title of the corresponding table (Tabula
 equacionum solis cum auge eius equata) indicates that the value for the solar apogee
 has already been taken into consideration. The argument, which we call K, in parallel
 with the standard usage of £,13 begins at 0°, not at 1° as was the common practice
 at the time. The entry for 0° is 2s 29;37,9° (=89;37,9°), and corresponds to the lon
 gitude of the solar apogee at epoch, 89;36,59° (see n. 4). The minimum 2s 27;27,9°
 is reached at 92°-94°, and the maximum 3s 1;47,9° at 267°-269°. Subtracting alge

 braically either of these two values from the entry for 0°, one gets 2;10,0°, which is

 the standard Alfonsine parameter for the maximum solar equation.14 Therefore, all
 entries for the solar equation, C(K), are displaced upwards by 89;37,9°, compared
 to the entries in the standard tables in the Alfonsine corpus, c(ic), to make all entries

 positive, thus allowing the user to avoid dealing with a set of complicated rules for
 adding and subtracting various terms:

 C(K) = c(k) + 89;37,9°. (2)

 This is the first example of a displaced table in this set, where the argument is the

 mean argument of center, K, and the entries represent C (K), which is the sum of the

 Alfonsine solar equation (whether positive or negative), c(jc), and the longitude of the

 solar apogee, A-a- In this case the displacement is vertical (see Fig. A).

 The canons to this table, which are not extant, should have had an instruction indi

 cating something like "to find the true position of the Sun, enter the table with the

 12 For Vimond, see Chabas and Goldstein (2004, p. 221); for the PAT, see Ratdolt (1483, f. d5r). For a
 modern edition of these tables, based on Ratdolt (1483), see Poulle (1984).

 13 Throughout this paper capital letters are used to represent variables and functions in the Tables of the
 Seven Planets.

 14 As in the tables of John Vimond (Chabas and Goldstein 2004, p. 223), the solar equation—with the
 same maximum of 2; 10°—is not explicitly given. For the maximum solar equation, 2; 10°, in the PAT, see
 Ratdolt (1483, f.e3r).

 5 Length of daylight, diurnal seasonal hours, and the equation of time

 On ff. 10v-l 1 v there is a table with a column for the argument from 1° to 30°, and
 three other columns for each of the twelve zodiacal signs, beginning with Aries. The
 headings are Horn equalis, tempus horarum, and equatio dierum. The first entries for
 Aries 1° are 12;3h, 15;4°, and 8;28 min, respectively. The entries in the first column,

 And, indeed, in Ptolemy's model for the equation of the Sun, A., the true longitude of

 the Sun is obtained adding its mean longitude, X, to the solar equation: X = X + c(i<).

 Now the solar equation is also the difference between the true argument of center of
 the Sun, k, and its mean argument of center, ic: it is negative if 0° < i< < 180°, and
 positive if 180° < k < 360°. The Tables of the Seven Planets yield the same result as
 that deduced from Ptolemy, for

 under Horn equalis, display the length of daylight (i.e., the time interval from sunrise
 to sunset) for a given locality; it reaches a maximum, 15;lOh, at Gem 28° — Cnc 2°,

 and a minimum, 8;50h, at Sgr 28° — Cap 2°. If we consider the obliquity of the ecliptic,

 s, to be 23;33°, the resulting geographical latitude, <p, for which the table is valid is
 (p = 42;44°, which agrees fairly well with the parallel through Toulouse (rather than
 with that of Paris, where the longest daylight is 16;0h). The geographical longitude
 (see above) and latitude that we derive from the tables do not yield good agreement

 with any place where astronomy was practiced in the fourteenth century, but a locality
 approximately fitting both computed coordinates is Perpignan.

 The entries in the second column, under tempus horarum, display the length of a

 diurnal seasonal hour (i.e., a twelfth of the length of daylight); it reaches a maximum,
 18;57h, at Gem 21° — Cnc 3°, and a minimum, 11 ;3h, at Sgr 21° — Cap 3°. These
 two columns are mutually consistent.

 The third column displays the equation of time (i.e., the difference between appar

 ent and mean time where apparent time is counted from true noon, that is, the moment
 that the true Sun crosses the meridian, and mean time is counted from mean noon).

 The argument is the solar longitude expressed in degrees and the entries are given
 in minutes and seconds of an hour. The extremal values are 0;21,24h (at Tau 26°),
 0; 1 l,16h (at Leo 5°), 0;31,48h (at Sco 8°), and 0;0,0h (at Aqr 20°-23°). When con
 verting these values into time-degrees, that is, multiplying each entry by 360°/24h, we
 obtain 5;21°, 2;49°, 7;57°, and 0,0°, respectively, which are the characteristic values

 found in the equation of time ascribed to Peter of Saint Omer and used by John of
 Ligneres, among others (see, e. g„ Chabas and Goldstein 2012, pp. 37-40).

 6 Mean motions of the Moon

 The mean motions of the Moon are addressed in five tables on ff. 12r-13r. In addition

 to columns for the various arguments, each table has three columns headed centrum
 lune (here meaning double elongation), porcio lune (argument of lunar anomaly), and
 medius locus lune (mean longitude of the Moon). Again, for the first two quantities
 this is not the standard terminology.

 The first table lists the radices at the beginning of each consecutive year from 1342

 for a period of 32 years. The entries for year 1 are 6s 3;36,2° (double elongation), 3s
 17;36,22° (anomaly), and 8s 10;16,38° (longitude). The second table gives the mean
 motion of the Moon for the months; the first entries, for March, are 1 s 5;49,36° (double

 elongation), Is 15;0,53° (anomaly), and Is 18;28,6° (longitude). The third and fourth
 tables are, respectively, from 1372 to 1852, at 32-year intervals, and for hours and

 parts of an hour, from 1 to 60. The fifth table is for days from 1 to 31, and the first

 entries for argument Id for the three variables are 0s 24;22,54° (double elongation),
 0s 13;3,54° (anomaly), and 0s 13;10,35° (longitude), confirming that the first column
 is indeed the double elongation, for 0s 24;22,54° = 2 • (0s 13;10,35° — 0s 0;59,8°).

 As was the case for the Sun, at the bottom of f. 12v we are given the radices for

 the three variables, anno Christi 1340 perfecto'. 9s 14;21,15,14° (double elongation),
 0s 18;53,8,0° (anomaly), and 4s 0;53,34,57° (longitude). We note that the values are

 given here to thirds and that the last digit for the anomaly is "0", indicating that the

 author was sensitive to accuracy. From the values of the radices and those for year 32

 in the first table for the mean motions of the Moon, we derive the following values for
 the mean motions: 24;22,53,23,16°/d (double elongation),15 13;3,53,57,30°/d (anom
 aly),16 and 13;10,35,l,15°/d (longitude).17 All of them are typical parameters of the
 PAT (Ratdolt 1483, f. d5v-d7r).

 We have recomputed the radices using the PAT for noon of February 28, 1341 for
 the meridian of Paris, 12° east of Toledo, that is, at 0;2d before noon in Toledo. The

 results are presented in Table 1.

 The agreement is good for the double elongation and the mean argument of center

 of the Sun, but much better results are obtained when recomputing the radices for
 0;l,57,30d before noon in Toledo, that is, for a locality 11 ;47,45° east of that Spanish
 city. The results are presented in Table 2.

 From Table 2 it follows that the mean argument of anomaly of the Moon tabulated
 here is diminished by 13;9° from that obtained from the PAT for a locality near the
 meridian of Paris, and that the mean lunar longitude is diminished by exactly 7;36°.
 As will be seen in Sect. 8, the displacements applied to the two quantities correspond,

 on the one hand, to the maximum value of the lunar equation of center in the PAT
 (13;9°) and, on the other hand, to the sum (7;36°) of two parameters, the maximum

 15 The value for year 32 given in the text is 4s 15;17,11°, and the difference between this value and that of
 the radix is 210;55,56°. Thus the amount of the double elongation in 32 years of 365; 15 days is 2I0;55,56°

 and 791 complete revolutions, leading to a daily mean motion of 24;22,53,23,16°/d.

 16 The value for year 32 given in the text is 12s 22;28,24° (read 2s 22;28,24°), and the difference between
 this value and that of the radix is 63;35,6°. Thus the amount traveled by the Moon in the argument of
 anomaly in 32 years of 365; 15 days is 63;35,6° and 424 complete revolutions, leading to a daily mean
 motion of 13;3,53,57,30°/d.

 17 The value for year 32 given in the text is Is 16;35,39°, and the difference between this value and that
 of the radix is 2B5;42,4°. Thus the amount traveled by the Moon in longitude in 32 years of 365;15 days is
 285;42,4° and 427 complete revolutions, leading to a daily mean motion of 13; 10,35,1,15°/d.

 8 Lunar equations

 The lunar equations are presented in three separate tables. The author, well aware
 of Ptolemy's second lunar model (see Fig. B), has split the treatment of the lunar
 equations, C3 and c, according to the two independent variables involved: the double

 elongation, 2rj, and the true argument of anomaly, a. The true longitude of the Moon is

 the sum of four positive terms, all of which are tabulated (see Eq. 14, below), whereas
 in the standard Alfonsine tables the true longitude of the Moon is the algebraic sum of
 three terms (see Eq. 8, below). Despite the differences in these procedures, we show
 that the results are the same.

 The longitude of the Moon, X, is found by applying an equation, c, to its mean
 longitude, X, which is a linear function of time: X = X + c. Moreover, the mean argu
 ment of anomaly, a, is also a linear function of time. In Ptolemy's second lunar model
 (.Almagest V.8), the lunar equation, c, depends on two independent variables: the true

 argument of anomaly, a (angle AcCL), and the double elongation, 2rj (twice the angu

 lar distance between the mean longitude of the Moon and the mean longitude of the
 Sun). In this context the lunar equation is a combination of functions of one variable

 represented by the 4th, 5th, and 6th columns of Ptolemy's table in Almagest V.8. The

 vast majority of later sets of tables used Ptolemy's approach, although some of them

 have slightly modified parameters or rearrangements of the order of the columns. In

 PAT these three columns correspond respectively to the 6th, 5th, and 4th columns; in

 the following, we will use the conventions of PAT to identify the columns <?,■:

 c = c6(a) +c5(a) • C4(2t])

 a = a + CT,(2rf).

 In Eqs. 6 and 7,03(2/7) is the equation of center, c^ilrj) represent the minutes of pro
 portion, C5(a) is called the increment, and C(,(a) is the equation of anomaly. Thus, the

 true longitude of the Moon is given by

 X = X + c6(a) + 05(a) ■ c4(2ri). (8)

 The first table (ff. 13v-14r) is for the equation of center; it has a column for the
 argument, from 0° to 29°, and then columns for each sign, from Os to lis. For each
 sign and each degree of the argument, we are given entries for the equation of center
 and the minutes of proportion (C3 and C4, respectively, in PAT's arrangement, both
 variables depending on the double elongation). For the tabulated equation of cen
 ter, the entry for 0s 0° is 13;9°. It reaches a maximum of 26;18° (twice 13;9°) at
 114°-115°, and a minimum of 0;0° at 245°-246°. So the equation of center of the
 Moon is tabulated with a vertical displacement, for its entries are displaced upwards

 by 13;9° with respect to the standard Alfonsine table (see Chabas and Goldstein 2012,
 Table 6.2A, p. 71). If we call 03(277) the equation of center in the corresponding

 Alfonsine table, the tabulated entries, C^,(2rj), for the equation of center in the Tables

 for the Seven Planets are given by

 C3(2?7) = c3(2?7) + 13;9°. (9)

 It is worth noting that Eq. 7 and the definition of A in Eq. 4 imply that A = a.18

 18 A = A + C&rj) = (a - 13;9°) + C3(2ij) = (a - 13;9°) + (c3(2;j) + 13;9°) = a + c3(2??) = a.

 For the minutes of proportion the entry for Os 0° is 0'. The entries increase mono

 tonically to 60' at 173°-187°, and decrease to 0' at 349°-371°. Except for copyist's
 errors, they agree with those in the PAT. Therefore,

 C4(2?j) = c4(2f7).

 (10)

 Let us now turn to the third table (ff. 14v-l 5r), which is for the equation of anomaly;

 it has a column for the argument, from 0° to 29°, and then columns for each zodiacal
 sign, from 0s to lis. For each sign and each degree of the argument, we are given
 entries for the equation of anomaly and the dyversitas dyametri proporcionalis19 (cor

 responding to c'6 and C5, respectively, in PAT's arrangement, both variables depending
 on the true argument of anomaly). For the equation of anomaly, the entry for 0s 0°
 is 4;56,0°. It reaches a minimum of 0;0,0° at 91°-99° and a maximum of 9;52,0°

 (twice 4;56,0°) at 264°, that is, the vertical displacement is 4;56°. This parameter was
 systematically used by Parisian Alfonsine astronomers, but its origin goes back much
 earlier (Chabas and Goldstein 2003, pp. 252-253). Thus, if we call C6(a) the equation
 of anomaly in the corresponding PAT, the tabulated entries, Cg(A), for the equation
 of anomaly in the Tables for the Seven Planets are given by

 C6(A) = c6(a)+4-56°.

 (ID

 The first entry in the column for the dyversitas dyametri proporcionalis, usually called
 "increment", is 2;40°; it reaches a minimum of 0;0° at 113°—119° and a maximum of

 5;20° (twice 2;40°) at 251°-257°. Except for copyist's errors, the entries agree with
 those in the PAT, but for the vertical displacement of 2;40°. Again, if we call C5 (a) the

 increment in the corresponding PAT, the tabulated entries, C5(A), for the increment
 in the Tables for the Seven Planets are given by

 C5(A) = c5(a) + 2;40°.

 (12)

 In the second table (f. 14v), headed dyversitas dyametri centralis, the argument is

 given at intervals of 1', from 0' to 60', and the entries, D(M), decrease monotonically
 from 2;40,0° (at 0') to 0;0,0° (at 60'). Moreover, the entries show a constant decrease

 of 0;2,40° for each degree of the argument (see Table A); hence,

 D(M) = 2;40 • (1 - C4(2rj)).

 (13)

 The tables described above yield the same results as those obtained from the PAT

 for the true position of the Moon, and were computed with a similar expression (see

 Eq. 8). If A. and L are the true lunar longitudes in the PAT and the Tables for the Seven

 A. = X + Cf,(a) + cs(a) ■ C4(2r})

 = (L + C6(A) + C5(A) ■ C4(2rj)) + 2;40° - 2;40° • C4(2t)) = L.

 The term, 2;40° • (1 — C4(2/y)) = D(M), is found in the table for the dyversitas
 dyametri centralis, and therefore the expression to compute the true longitude of the
 Moon is

 where all the terms are tabulated and none of them is to be subtracted. Note that there

 is no counterpart to the function D(M) in the standard Alfonsine tables.

 The canons to this set of tables, which are not extant, should have had an instruction

 more or less in the following terms: "To determine the true position of the Moon, find
 the mean longitude of the Moon, and keep it; find the double elongation, and enter

 with it in the table for the equation of center and the minutes of proportion, and keep

 them. Find the mean argument of anomaly, and add to it the equation of center to

 obtain the true argument of anomaly, and enter with it in the table for the equation of

 anomaly and the increment, and keep them. Enter the table for the dyversitas dyametri

 centralis with the minutes of proportion, and keep what you find there. Then add the

 mean longitude to the true argument of anomaly, and add the result to what is obtained

 from multiplying the increment by the minutes of proportion. To the value obtained

 add what you found in the table for the dyversitas dyametri centralis."

 To illustrate Eq. 14 consider the Moon at epoch (noon, February 28, 1341), when

 the double elongation, 2rj, was 4,45;9,0° (=285;9,0°). The equation of center in the
 standard Alfonsine tables is 03(2*7) = —10;26° and, because of Eq. 9, C^Clrj) =

 2;43°(=—10;26° +13;9°). The corresponding minutes of proportion are c^dr]) = 19
 and C^{2r}) = 19, because of Eq. 10. In this case the term D(M) — 1;49,20°. Now,
 the argument of anomaly, a, according to the standard Alfonsine tables, is 32;27,43°,
 and thus a = 22; 1,43°(=32;27,43°-10;26°). From Eq. 4, A = 19; 18,43°, and thus
 A = 22; 1,43° (=19; 18,43° +2;43°). The tabulated values for the equation of anomaly,
 C6(A), and the dyversitas dyametri proporcionalis, C5(A), are 3;13,19° and 1;48°,

 respectively, whereas the values for the equation of anomaly, C(,(a), and the increment,
 cs(a), found in the standard Alfonsine tables are —1;42,41° and — 0;52°, respectively.
 We note that Eqs. 11 and 12 hold. According to Eq. 6, using the standard Alfon
 sine tables the correction to be applied is c = (—1:42,41°) + (—0;52°) • (19/60) =
 —1;59,9°, whereas using the Tables of The Seven Planets C = 3;13,19° + 1;48° •
 (19/60) = 3;47,31°.

 With the standard Alfonsine tables the mean lunar longitude at epoch, X, is

 computed to be 128;55,23°; thus, with Eq. 8, the true lunar longitude of the Moon at
 epoch is

 X = X + ce(a) + 05(a) ■ C4(2r7)

 = 128;55,23° - 1;59,9° = 126;56,14°.

 With the Tables for the Seven Planets we obtain L = 121; 19,23° (see Eq. 5); thus,
 with Eq. 14, the true longitude of the Moon at epoch is

 L = L + C6(A) + C5(A) • C4(277) + D(M)

 = 121; 19,23° + 3;47,31° + 1;49,20° = 126;56,14°,

 in agreement with X.

 9 Lunar node

 Folio 16r contains five tables for the mean motion of the lunar node. The first lists

 the values of the mean motion of the node at the beginning of each year, beginning

 with 1342, for a period of 32 years. The entry for year 1, i.e., 1342, or more precisely,
 February 28,1341, is 3s 22;3;17°. The second table gives the mean motion of the Sun

 for the months; its first entry corresponds to March (0s 1;38,30°) and the last one to

 February (0s 19;19,42°). The third table lists values from 1372 to 1852, at 32-year
 intervals. The fourth and fifth tables are, respectively, for the mean motion of the lunar

 node for days from 1 to 31, and for hours and parts of an hour from 1 to 60. The entry

 for argument Id is 0s 0;0,3,11°. As was the case for other mean motions, at the bottom

 of the folio we are told that the radix at anno Christi 1340perfecto is 3s 2;43,34,43°.
 From this value and that for year 32 we derive —0;3,10,38,7°/d as the mean motion

 of the lunar node,20 in full agreement with the corresponding parameter in the PAT.

 20 The value for year 32 given in the text is Us 21 ;39,20°, and the difference between this value and that
 of the radix is 258;55,45,17°. Thus the amount traveled by the lunar node in 32 years of 365; 15 days is
 285;42,4° and one complete revolution, leading to a daily mean motion of —0;3,10,38,7°/d.

 Displaced tables in Latin 15

 10 Precession/trepidation

 On folios 16v-17r there are various tables for precession/trepidation in the framework
 of the PAT. In general, the approach found in the Alfonsine corpus is to treat two
 terms separately: a linear term, usually called "motion of the apogees and the fixed
 stars", based on a mean motion of 0;0,0,4,20,41,17,12°/d, and presented in a single
 table; and a periodic term, usually called "motion of access and recess of the 8th
 sphere", requiring the use of two tables (one for the "mean motion", based on a value
 of 0;0,0,30,24,49,0°/d, and another for its "equation", found in a separate table with a
 maximum of 9;0,0°): see Chabas and Goldstein (2012, pp. 48-52).

 The author of the Tables for the Seven Planets follows the same approach, uses the

 same parameters, but gives a different presentation. Folio 16v has four tables under

 the general title Tabula motus augium et stellarum fixarum atque 8° spere, displaying

 the two mean motions of the components of Alfonsine variable precession. Each table

 has two columns, in addition to that for the argument: the mean motion of the apogees

 and the fixed stars on the one hand, and the mean motion of the 8th sphere on the

 other. The motion of trepidation is to be applied to the positions of the fixed stars as

 well as to the positions of the planetary apogees.

 The first table gives entries for both quantities at the beginning of each year for

 a period of 32 consecutive years. The entries for year 1 are 0s 0;51,12° (apogees)
 and 2s 8;10;51° (8th sphere), and those for year 32 are 0s 1;4,52° (apogees) and
 2s 9;46;31° (8th sphere). The second table gives the mean motion of both quanti
 ties for accumulated months. The third table, headed ad annos perpetuacionis, has
 entries for years 1372 to 1852, at 32-year intervals, of both quantities, whereas the
 fourth table is for their mean motions for days from 1 to 31. As was the case for
 other quantities, at the bottom of the folio we are given the radices for both quanti
 ties, anno Christi 1340 perfecto: 0s 9;50,45,59,27° (apogees), and 2s 8;7,45,20,10°

 (8th sphere).21 From these radices and the entries for year 32 we derive the following
 mean motions: 0;0,26,28°/y (apogees) and 0;3,5,1 l°/y (8th sphere), which correspond
 to about 0;0,0,4,20,51°/d (apogees) and 0;0,0,30,25,12°/d (8th sphere), that is, 1 revo
 lution in 49,000 and 7,000 years, respectively. These are the standard values found in
 Alfonsine astronomy for precession/trepidation. Combining the mean motion of the

 8th sphere and its radix, we find that the argument of the 8th sphere was 0° about
 1324 years and 9 months before the epoch of these tables (February 28, 1341), that is,
 in May 16 AD. This date is explicitly given by Giovanni Bianchini (fifteenth century)

 as the epoch of the Alfonsine model; see Chabas and Goldstein (2009, p. 32), and the

 Tables for the Seven Planets offer a justification of it.

 It remains to compute the periodic term of Alfonsine trepidation, that is, the equa

 tion of the 8th sphere, which is tabulated on f. 17r. Indeed, the entries given in the

 table are based on the standard Alfonsine equation of the 8th sphere which reaches
 a maximum of 9;0,0° at 90°, a minimum of —9;0,0° at 270°, and vanishes at 0° and

 180° (see also Ratdolt 1483, f. d3v). The corresponding entries on f. 17r are 9;0,0° at
 0°, 18;0,0° (maximum) at 90°, 9;0,0° at 180°, 0;0,0° (minimum) at 270°, and 0;0,0°

 21 We note that the radix for the apogees has the wrong number of degrees (probably a copyist's error); to
 be consistent with the 32 values in the table, it should be Os 0;50,45,59,27°.

 at 360°; thus, the entries are displaced upwards by 9° from the standard table, and can

 be represented by the modern expression (where y is the entry and x is the argument):

 y = 9° + arcsin(sin9° • sinx). (15)

 This is another case of a vertically displaced table we find in this manuscript. Inter

 estingly, the only example in Latin of a displaced table previously known to us is that

 of John Vimond (see n. 10), whose table for the equation of the 8th sphere presents
 both a vertical displacement (8;17°) and a horizontal displacement (113°). However,
 Vimond's purpose was not to avoid "negative" numbers in his table (otherwise he
 would have used a vertical displacement of at least 9;0°, as here); rather, he wished to

 set the origin of the equation of the 8th sphere at the value (8; 17°) it had at the time he

 composed his tables (1320). Apparently, the author of the Tables for the Seven Planets

 did not have the same goal as Vimond, although he used the same principle.

 As mentioned above, on folio 17r there is also a small table entitled Motus augiuni
 equatus ad 32 annos post annum 1340, listing 32 values. The first entry is 0;0,37,11°

 and the last entry, for 32 years, is 0; 19,42,35°. The entries show a steady increase but
 the line-by-line differences do not reveal a clear pattern. A complement to this table

 is found on f. 18r among the tables for the mean motions, where we find one headed
 Motus augium equatus ad annos perpetuacionis, listing entries from 1372 to 1852 at
 intervals of 32 years. The first entry is 0; 19,42,35° but, as in the previous case, the
 line-by-line differences do not vary in a smooth way. With all these cautions, from

 the entry for 32 years it is possible to derive a motion of the apogee of 0;0,36,57°/y,

 or 0;0,0,6,4°/d, which is the amount to be added to the mean motion in solar anomaly
 to obtain the mean motion in the argument of solar longitude (see Sect. 3). The value

 we deduce from the table is certainly close to Ptolemy's value for precession of 1° in
 100 years, that is 0;0,36° in 1 Egyptian year of 365 days.

 11 Planetary mean motions

 Next come tables for the mean motions, equations, and stations of the five planets,
 on ff. 17v-22r (Saturn), ff. 22r-26v (Jupiter), ff. 27r-31r (Mars), ff. 31r-35v (Venus),

 and ff. 35r-40r (Mercury). In this section we review the mean motions of the planets,

 for each of which we are given five tables. As we will see, all the mean motions are

 displaced with respect to those in the standard Alfonsine tables.

 The first of these five tables lists the radices of two variables, centrum (argument of

 center) and porcio (here meaning the displaced argument of anomaly, as will be seen

 below), for the beginning of each year after 1340 for a period of 32 consecutive years.

 The entries for both variables for year 32 are, respectively: ls6;7,52° and Is 14;30,11°
 (Saturn); 8s 12;53,57° and 8s 18;7,43° (Jupiter); 2s 0;5,0° and 2s 19;44,28° (Mars); 6s
 25;36,12° and 7s 22;56,20° (Venus); and 3s 19;22,12° and2s4;36,10°(Mercury). The
 second of these tables gives the mean motion of the planets for accumulated months,

 beginning in March, for the two variables. The third of these tables is headed ad annos

 perpetuacionis and displays entries for the two variables from 1372 to 1852, at 32-year

 intervals. The fourth and fifth of these tables are, respectively, for the mean motion of

 the planets for days from 1 to 31, and for hours and parts of an hour from 1 to 60.

 From the values of the radices and those for year 32 in the first table for the mean

 motions of the planets, we derive the following values for the daily mean motions:

 ter); and 0;31,26,32,35°/d (Mars, argument of center). These three parameters differ by

 0;0,0,6,4°/d from the standard Alfonsine mean motions, as was the case for the argu

 ment of solar anomaly, indicating that the precession of 1° in 100 years was applied to

 the planets as well as to the Sun. We have also derived the daily mean motions of anom

 aly for the inferior planets: 0;36,59,27,24°/d (Venus) and 3;6,24,7,43°/d (Mercury),
 which agree exactly with the corresponding parameters in the PAT.

 As was the case for the Sun and the Moon, we are also given the radices anno christi

 1340 completo, which we display in Table 3.

 We have recomputed the mean positions of the planets using the PAT for noon

 of February 28, 1341 for the meridian of Paris, 12° east of Toledo. The results are
 presented in Table 4.

 From Table 4 it follows that the arguments of center of the five planets given in
 these tables are diminished, but for a few seconds, by 14°, 18°, 61°, 51°, and 28°
 from those obtained from the PAT for a locality near the meridian of Paris. Table 4

 also indicates that the entries for the argument of anomaly are diminished, but for a
 few seconds, by 7°, 6°, 12°, 3°, and 4° from those derived from the PAT. As will be

 shown in Sect. 12, all these integer values correspond to the horizontal and vertical
 displacements (khi and kV3, respectively) used in the tables for the equations of the

 12 Planetary equations and stations

 In this section we review the equations and the stations of the five planets, for each
 of which we are also given five tables, in which the equation of center (one table;
 see Sect. 12.1) and the equation of anomaly (four tables; see Sects., 12.2 and 12.3)

 are treated separately. Figure C displays the model for Mars. As we will see, the true

 longitude of a planet is found by adding four positive terms, all of which are tabulated

 (see Eqs. 43 and 45, below). These terms are all different from those in the standard

 Fig. C Model for Mars, where O is the observer, D is the center of the deferent circle AC P, A is the
 apogee, P is the perigee, E is the equant point, 0 V is the direction to the vernal point on the ecliptic, 5
 is the direction to the mean Sun, Ae is the mean apogee on the epicycle whose center is C, Ae is the true

 apogee on the epicycle, k and a are the mean arguments of center and anomaly, respectively, M is the mean
 position of the planet, and M is its true position (where, for an outer planet, CM is parallel to OS)

 Alfonsine tables, where the true longitude is found as the algebraic sum of four terms.
 The author of these tables has considered two cases: (1) the epicyle is near the apogee

 of the deferent, and (2) the epicycle is near the perigee of the deferent. In case 1 he has
 the distance of the center of the epicycle vary from its maximum to its mean value,

 whereas in case 2 he has the distance of the center of the epicycle vary from its mean
 to its minimum value.

 12.1 Equation of center and equatio porcionis

 In the first table the argument ranges from 0° to 29° for each zodiacal sign, and for

 each degree we are given three entries: equatio centri, equatio porcionis, and minutes

 of proportion. The first two are given in degrees and minutes, and the third entry is
 given in minutes (see Table B).

 Table 5 displays significant values of the equation of center for the five planets. To

 determine the relation between the equation of center presented here and that in the

 PAT, let us consider the case of Mars. The entry for 0° is 2;29°; the minimum (0;36°) is
 reached at 31°-35° and the maximum (23;24°) at 203°-207°. The difference between

 the two extremal values is 22;48°, that is, twice 11;24°, the standard parameter used
 for Mars in the PAT. The entries in the table are displaced exactly 12° upwards as com

 pared with the corresponding entries in the PAT, and 12° is the minimum integer for a

 vertical displacement ensuring that all entries for the equation of center are positive.

 But the entries for the equation of center have a second displacement, a horizontal dis
 placement, of 61° with respect to the table in the PAT. With the notation used above,

 K = k — 61°. If we call c3(k) the equation of center in the corresponding PAT,22 the

 tabulated entries, C3 (K), for the equation of center in the Tables for the Seven Planets
 are given by C3(K) = c3(K + 61°) + 12°. This is the first example of a horizontal
 displacement in these tables. For each planet the corresponding displacement applied

 to k (see Table 5) accounts for the difference between the entries given in the Tables

 for the Seven Planets and the PAT. Thus, the general rule for the equation of center of

 the planets can be written as

 C3(K) = c3(K + kh3) + kv3, (18)

 where kh3 and kv3 are the horizontal and vertical displacements associated with c3 (k),

 the equation of center in the PAT. Once C3(K) is known, the true argument of center,
 K, is defined as:

 on analogy with the expression for the true argument of center, k , used in the Alfonsine
 tables,

 K = K+C3(K), (19)

 k = k +c3(ic), (20)

 where c3(k) < 0° when 0° < k < 180°, as shown in Fig. D.

 All the underlying parameters displayed in Table 5 are strictly in the tradition of

 the Alfonsine corpus. Interestingly, the function for Venus is presented with displace
 ments that differ from that for the Sun (see Sect. 4, above), although they share the
 same maximum equation, 2;10°.

 As for the column labeled equatio porcionis, note that for a given argument its

 entries and those corresponding to them in the equation of center always add up to an

 integer number of degrees: 14° (Saturn), 12° (Jupiter), 24° (Mars), 6° (Venus), and 8°

 (Mercury). This is exactly twice the vertical displacement applied to each planet, that
 is, 2 ■ kv3. Thus, if we call the equatio porcionis E(K), it follows that the author of
 the Tables of the Seven Planets defined it as

 E(K) + C3(K) = 2-kv3. (21)

 This definition was intended to eliminate subtractions, as will be justified below: there
 is no counterpart to the function E(K) in the standard Alfonsine tables. Figure D

 22 In the PAT the equation of center is displayed in the third column in the tables for planetary equations,
 hence the notation used here.

 Fig. I) Mars, equation of center and equatio porcionis

 shows the equation of center and the equatio porcionis in the case of Mars. The other

 planets follow the same pattern (see Table 5).

 When E(K) is known, the true anomaly, A, is defined as:

 A = A + E(K) (22)

 on analogy with the expression for the true argument of anomaly, a, used in the Al
 fonsine tables,

 a = a — C3 (it) (23)

 where, again, ci(ic) < 0° when 0° < k < 180°.

 In the third column of this table the entries for the minutes of proportion are also

 dependent upon those in the PAT (see Fig. E for the case Mars) except for two features:

 a horizontal displacement, different for each planet, and a vertical displacement of 60',

 which is limited to the positions when the planet is near its apogee. Note that in the
 PAT the minutes of proportion for these positions are subtractive, whereas they are
 additive for the positions near perigee. Consequently, in order to avoid subtractions,
 the author of the Tables for the Seven Planets only applied a vertical displacement of
 60' to half of the column, that is, where the center of the epicycle is near apogee, and
 left unchanged the additive part (for details see Table 6). With this approach, if an
 entry, c^k), gives the minutes of proportion in the PAT,23 the corresponding entry in
 the Tables for the Seven Planets in the case of Mars is Ci(K) = C4(K + 49°) + 60',

 near apogee, and C^(K) = c^(K + 49°), near perigee. Thus, the general rule for the
 equation of center of the planets can be written as

 23 In the PAT the minutes of proportion are displayed in the fourth column in the tables for planetary equa
 tions; hence the notation used here. Note, however, that in the corresponding table in Ptolemy's Almagest
 they are found in the eighth column and depend on the mean argument of center, whereas in the PAT they

 are a function of the true argument of center. For this function in the Almagest, see Neugebauer (1975, pp.
 185-186).

 minutes of proportion for Mars; the other planets follow the same pattern (see Table 6).
 As in previous cases, the vertical displacements are intended to avoid cumbersome
 rules for addition and subtraction corresponding to the simple rules we now give by
 means of algebraic signs. The horizontal displacements are intended to counterbalance

 another displacement in a different column or table. That this is indeed the case can be

 seen from the fact that the horizontal displacements applied to the argument of center

 (the column on the right side in Table 5) and to the minutes of proportion (the column
 on the right side in Table 6) add up algebraically to the vertical displacement applied

 to the equation of center (see Table 5):

 kh3 — kh4 = k vj,.

 (26)

 From Eqs. 16, 18, 20, and 26 it follows that

 K = k — kh\.

 (27)

 Therefore kh\ is the displacement to be applied to the Alfonsine true argument of

 center to obtain the true argument of center in the Tables of the Seven Planets.24

 12.2 Equation of anomaly near greatest distance

 For each planet the equation of anomaly is displayed in four tables: two, here called
 (i) and (ii), associated with greatest distance (i.e., between greatest and mean dis
 tance) and two, with exactly the same presentation, associated with least distance
 (i.e., between mean and least distance: see Sect. 12.3). In the Almagest and sets of
 tables related to it the equation of anomaly is treated separately when the center of
 the epicycle is near apogee in contrast to the case when the center of the epicycle

 near perigee. Ptolemy first assumed that the center of the epicycle is at mean distance
 and computed the equation of anomaly under this condition (Ptolemy's column 6). He

 then considered the case where the center of the epicycle lies between maximum dis
 tance (apogee), where the equation of anomaly is least, and mean distance. Ptolemy's
 column 5 gives the subtractive difference to be applied to the equation of anomaly
 at mean distance. This is because at maximum distance the equation of anomaly is
 least. To interpolate between mean distance and maximum distance Ptolemy applied
 the minutes of proportion in his column 8 to the subtractive difference; thus, in this
 case, the total equation is

 c{a) = C(,(a) - c5(a) • c8(k)

 (28)

 where ic is near apogee. As Neugebauer (1975, pp. 185-186) demonstrated, Ptolemy

 used different formulas for cs(i<) near apogee and near perigee, but put the values in a

 single column. Between mean distance and perigee Ptolemy computed the entries in

 his column 7 which is the amount to the added to the value for mean distance to get

 the equation of anomaly at least distance (perigee) where the equation of anomaly is

 greatest; thus, in this case, the total equation is

 c(a) - c6(a) + c-j(a) ■ c8(at),

 (29)

 where k is near perigee. So in some cases one has to subtract and in other cases one has
 to add. The author of the Tables for the Seven Planets wished to avoid subtractions and

 he took a different approach without changing the model or the parameters. Instead of

 24 Indeed, K = K+C-}(K) = ic—kh2+c^(ic)+kv} = /c+C3(;e)—kh^+kws = K—^khi+kv^) = K—kh4.

 Displaced tables in Latin 25

 first tabulating the values for mean distance with a subtractive difference, he tabulated

 the equation of anomaly at greatest distance, where the equation is least. Hence, all
 corrections are positive, and the total equation is

 C(A) = D(A) + C5(A)-C4(K), (30)

 where D(A) is the equation of anomaly at apogee, Cs(A) corresponds to Ptolemy's
 05(0;), and c.4(K) (defined in Eq. 24) corresponds to Ptolemy's C8(k); all terms are
 positive. For values of k near perigee, the author of the Tables for the Seven Planets

 adhered more closely to Ptolemy's formula since it did not involve subtraction. Thus,
 between mean distance and minimum distance, our author used

 C(A) = C6(A) + C7(A).C4(/0, (31)

 where C(,(A) corresponds to Ptolemy's 04(a), C-j(A) corresponds to Ptolemy's ci(A),
 and C4(K) (defined in Eq. 25) corresponds to Ptolemy's c%(k). We will see that the
 entry for mean distance is the same whether one uses the formula near apogee or the
 formula near perigee.

 (i) The argument is the minutes of proportion, as indicated in the heading, displayed
 here as integers from 0 to 60. There are two other columns, one labeled diversitas dy

 ametri centralis and another for the first station near greatest distance (see Table C).

 The entries corresponding to 0 refer to greatest distance, and the entries corresponding
 to 60 refer to mean distance.

 This table is unprecedented in the astronomical literature and, in the absence of

 canons explaining its use, it is difficult to interpret the meaning of the expression,
 diversitas dyametri centralis. Table 7 shows the extremal values for all planets.

 A close inspection of the entries for the diversitas dyametri centralis indicates that

 they are strongly dependent on the apogees of the planets at epoch (noon, February
 28, 1341, Toledo). A comparison of our computation of the planetary apogees for the

 city of Toledo at that time and the entries for 0 for each planet is displayed in Table 8.
 From Table 8 it follows that the entries for 0 tabulated here for the diversitas dy
 ametri centralis are obtained by adding a constant to the longitude of the apogee of

 a As will be seen below, the rounded value for each planet should result from subtracting the maximum
 of C6 — C5 (see Table 10) from kv^ (see Table 5). In the case of Jupiter, this gives 1;26° (=12 — 10;34),
 whereas we obtain 1 ;6° when using the entry for 0 in the table, 5s 22;37,40° (see Table 7), and a set of
 standard Alfonsine tables. If the author had taken 5s 22;57,40° as the entry for 0, the rounded value would
 have been fully consistent with those for the other planets

 each planet at epoch, Xo- This constant is specific to each planet and results in turn
 from the displacements applied to its variables, khu — max(c6 — C5): see Table 10.

 Therefore, these entries play a crucial role in computing the true planetary longitudes

 but have no direct astronomical meaning. On the other hand, for each planet the range
 for the entries is 0;20,42° (=8s 12;42,18° — 8s 12;21,36°) or 0;21° (if we consider

 8s 12;21,18° as the intended entry for 60) for Saturn, 0;30° for Jupiter, 5;38° for

 Mars, 1;42° for Venus, and 3; 12° for Mercury. It turns out that these values agree with
 the vertical displacement applied to the difference at greatest distance, C5, associated

 with the argument of anomaly. We have called this quantity kv5 (see Table 11). In the

 case of Mars, its value is 5;38°, and the diversitas dyametri centralis near greatest
 distance, £>5, which is a function of the minutes of proportion, M, can be written as

 Ds(M) = £>5(0) — 5;38 • C\(K). Thus, the general rule for the diversitas dyametri
 centralis near greatest distance is given by

 D5(M) = £>5(0) - kv5 ■ C4(K),

 The third column in this table displays the first station as a function of the minutes

 of proportion. The entries for the first station represent the true argument of anomaly
 of the first stationary point, and those for 0 agree with the entries in the Almagest
 (see, e.g., Toomer 1984, p. 588) and sets of tables related to it. They correspond to

 the greatest distance of the center of the epicycle, when the mean argument of center,
 k, is zero. It should be recalled that the table in Almagest XII.8 gives the positions

 of the stationary points on the epicycle as a function of ic (see Neugebauer 1975, pp.
 202-205), not as a function of the minutes of proportion, as is the case here. The

 entries increase (except for Mercury) monotonically and vary in a range different for
 each planet: 1;23° (Saturn), 1;34° (Jupiter), 5;43° (Mars), 1; 18° (Venus), and —2;6°
 (Mercury). Figure F displays the first station of Mars, both near apogee (see Table 7)
 and near perigee (Table 12).

 If we call 1S5 (M) the tabulated argument of anomaly of the first station near apo

 gee, the entries can be computed by means of a linear function of M, the minutes of
 proportion:

 S5(M) = 55(0) + [S5(60) - S5(0)] • C4(K), (33)

 which, in the case of Mars, turns into

 S5(M) = 157;28° + 5;43° ■ C4(K).

 (ii) In the second table the argument ranges from 0° to 29° for each zodiacal sign.
 There are two columns, one for the equation of anomaly (the heading has argumen

 tum for anomaly) and another for the diversitas dyametri. The title indicates that the

 entries are given for greatest distance of the center of the epicycle (ad longitudinem

 is generally diversitas dyametri directus, and sometimes diversitas dyametri retro
 gradus, a change which is indicated by the insertion of the words statio, prima, and
 secunda, among the entries. See Table D.

 The relevant information for the equation of anomaly is summarized in Table 9,

 where the "underlying parameter" was derived by taking half the difference between

 maximum and minimum equation of anomaly.

 C6 — C5, that is, the maximum difference between the equation of anomaly at mean
 distance and the subtractive difference in the PAT.25 All these values are shown in

 Table 10.

 Figure G displays the tabulated values of the equation of anomaly for Mars near

 In the case of Mars the expression for the equation of anomaly at greatest distance

 subtractive difference and the equation of anomaly at mean distance; hence the notation used here.

 which, in the case general, corresponds to

 D(A) = c6(a) - c5(a) + max(c6 - c5). (34)

 The diversitas dyametri tabulated for each planet is the difference near greatest dis
 tance. The entries in this column agree with those for the same quantity, cs(a), in the
 PAT, but for a vertical displacement, which differs from one planet to another (see
 Table 11).

 In the case of Mars this displacement amounts to 5;38°. In general, if C5(a) is the

 difference near greatest distance in the corresponding PAT, that in the Tables for the
 Seven Planets is given by

 C5(A) = c5(a) + kv5. (35)

 We note that A = a, which is a consequence of equations 17, 18, 21, and 22.26 There
 fore, the displacements applied by the author of the Tables for the Seven Planets to
 the standard quantities used in Alfonsine planetary astronomy are such that they keep

 invariant the argument of anomaly.

 As in Eq. 28, the total correction when the planet is near apogee in Ptolemy's

 notation is

 which, in standard Alfonsine notation, is equivalent to

 c(a) = C(,(a) - c5(a) • cg(^),

 c(a) - c6(a) - c5(a) ■ c4(k).

 In the Tables for the Seven Planets the corresponding expression near apogee is

 C(A) = D(A) + C5(A) • C4(/0, (36)

 an expression only involving positive terms and leading to the same true longitude of

 the planets as the standard Alfonsine procedure.

 Indeed, A = A + E(K) = (a — kv^) + (2-kv-} —C^(k)) = a+kv3 — [(03(^)4-kvy)] = a — c^iic) = a.

 12.3 Equation of anomaly near least distance

 The following two tables, for least distance (i.e., between mean and least distance),
 have the same presentation as those for greatest distance (i.e., between greatest and
 mean distance), reviewed in Sect. 12.2 (i) and (ii).

 (i) As in Table C the argument is the minutes of proportion from 0' to 60', and

 there are two other columns, one labeled diversitas dyametri centralis and another for

 the first station near least distance (see Table E). Here the entries for 0' correspond to

 mean distance, and the entries for 60' correspond to least distance.

 The extremal values of the two columns (diversitas dyametri centralis and first

 station) for all planets are listed in Table 12.

 As was the case for greatest distance, the entries for 0' tabulated here for the div

 ersitas dyametri centralis are obtained by adding a constant to the longitude of the

 apogee of each planet at epoch, aq. This constant is specific to each planet and results

 in turn from the displacements applied to its variables: kli4 — kv6 (see Table 13).

 On the other hand, the range for the entries is: 0;25° for Saturn, 0;33° for Jupiter,

 8;3° for Mars, 1 ;52° for Venus, and 2; 10 for Mercury. The entries for least distance are

 a As will be seen below, the rounded value for each planet should result from subtracting kv(, (see Table 14)
 from kv 3 (see Table 5). In the case of Jupiter, this gives 0;57° (=12 — 11 ;3), whereas we obtain 0;37° when
 using the entry for 0 in the table, 5s 22;8,40° (see Table 12) and a set of standard Alfonsine tables. If the
 author had taken 5s 22;28,40° as the entry for 0, the rounded value would have been fully consistent with
 those for the other planets. (This is the same situation we noted in Table 8; thus, it would seem that the
 author either miscopied an entry for Jupiter on which he built up his two tables for the diversitas dyametri

 centralis, or that he had at his disposal a table for Jupiter generating a difference of 0;20°.)

 not exactly a continuation of those for greatest distance (Table 7), because they were

 computed by means of different expressions and different ranges were used. In the case
 of Mars the vertical displacement applied here, kv-j, is 8;3° rather than kv$ = 5; 38°,
 as was the case at greatest distance. Then the diversitas dyametri centralis near least
 distance, D~j, can be written as D-j(M) = Di(0) — where M is a value for

 the minutes of proportion. Thus, the general rule for the diversitas dyametri centralis
 near least distance is given by

 Dy(M) = Z>?(0) - kv7 ■ C4(K)

 that is,

 D-/(M) = Xq + kti4 — kv(, — kv-/ ■ C4(K). (37)

 The third column in this table displays the argument of anomaly of the first station
 near least distance as a function of the minutes of proportion (Table 12). The entries

 follow the same pattern as those near greatest distance, but we note that the entries
 for 60' at greatest distance (see Table 7) do not coincide with the entries for 0' near

 least distance (see Table 12) in three cases: Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. The entries for
 60' essentially agree with those in the Almagest and sets of tables related to it, corre

 sponding to the least distance of the center of the epicycle, when the mean argument

 of center, ic, is 180°. The entries, graphed in Fig. F, increase (except for Mercury)
 monotonically and vary in a range which is different for each planet: 1 ;19° (Saturn),

 1;31° (Jupiter), 6;9° (Mars), 1;12° (Venus), and -0;40° (Mercury).

 If we call S^ (M) the tabulated argument of anomaly of the first station near perigee,
 the entries are can be computed by means of a linear function of M, the minutes of

 of the equation of anomaly for Venus near least distance in the Tables for the Seven
 Planets and at mean distance in the PAT. The terminology in the Tables of the Seven

 Planets may be confusing, but the author sought to maintain a parallel structure in
 his treatment of the equation of anomaly near apogee and near perigee. The entries
 near apogee range from greatest distance to mean distance, and those near perigee
 range from mean distance to least distance. Hence, what is here called "the equation
 of anomaly near least distance" actually refers to the equation of anomaly at mean
 distance, to be applied to distances between mean and least distance.

 27 This expression is equivalent to C(,(A) = C(,(A) + kv6, because A = a.

 The diversitas dvametri tabulated for each planet is the difference near least dis
 tance to be added to the corresponding equation of anomaly at mean distance (see
 the extremal values in Table 15). The entries in this column agree with those for the

 same quantity, c-j(a), in the PAT, but for a displacement, which differs from one planet
 to another. If cj (a) is the difference at least distance in the corresponding PAT, the

 difference at least distance in the Tables for the Seven Planets is given by

 C-j(A) = c-j(a) + kvj. (40)

 anomaly is greatest.28

 the planet is near perigee is

 c(a) = c6(a) + c7(a) • c8(k),

 which, in standard Alfonsine notation, is equivalent to

 c(a) = C(,(a) + C7(a) • C4(ii).

 In the Tables for the Seven Planets, the corresponding expression near perigee is

 C(A) = C6(A) + C7(A)-C4(K). (41)

 k = ko + k + c(a),

 where c(a) = C(,(a) + c-j(a) ■ C4(k).

 28 These tables bear some similarity with the tables of John Vimond, who tabulated eg — c 5, but he did not

 apply any displacements to the planets. Vimond also tabulated C5 + C7, which has no counterpart in these
 tables (see Chabas and Goldstein 2004, pp. 248-256).

 where C(A) = C(,(A) + C7(A) ■ C4(K): see Eq. 41. The term D7(M) is tabulated
 under diversitas dyametri centralis.

 The general expression for the longitude of a planet near perigee is therefore

 given as

 which can be obtained from

 To be sure,

 L = D7(M) + K + C6(A) + C7(A) • C4(K), (43)

 X — Xo + k + C(,(a) + cj(a) ■ C4(k). (44)

 X = A.o + k + C(,(a) + c-j(a) ■ c4(k)

 = Xo + (K + kh4) + (C(,(A) — kv(,) + (C7(A) — kv-j) • C4(K)

 = Xq + kh4 - kv6 - kvj ■ C4(K) + K + C6(A) + Cy(A) • C4K) = L,

 provided that D-j(M) = Xq + kh4 — kvf, — kv-j ■ C4(K), which is the case: see Eq. 37.
 All terms appearing in Eq. 43 are positive and are found directly in the tables. Note
 that £>5(M) and Dy(M) have no counterparts in the standard Alfonsine tables.

 To illustrate Eq. 43 consider the position of Mars at epoch (noon. February 28,
 1341), when the planet is near perigee. The mean argument of center, K, and the mean
 argument of anomaly, A, are given as 55;6,26° and 84;48,42°, respectively, rounded to
 the seconds (see Table 3). From Eqs. 16 and 17 it follows that H and a in the standard
 Alfonsine Tables are 116;6,26° and 96;48,42°, respectively (where kh3 = 61° and
 kU3 = 12°: see Table 5). The corresponding values of the equation of center in both
 sets of tables are Ci(K) — 1;23° and c^(i<) = —10; 37°, and Eq. 18 holds. Thus,
 the true arguments of center are K = 56;29° and k = 105;29°, and Eq. 27 holds,
 where kh4 = 49° (see Table 6). The tabulated equatio porcionis for K = 55;6,26°
 is E(K) = 22;37°, and thus A = 84;48,42° + 22;37° = 107;26°. The argument of
 anomaly, a, according to the PAT, is 107;26° (=96;48,42° + 10;37°), and we note that
 A = a. The minutes of proportion corresponding to K = 56; 29° and k = 105;29° are
 C4(K) = 17/60 and c4{k) = 17/60, and we note that C4(K) — c4(k), as indicated in

 Eq. 25, valid near perigee. The tabulated values for the equation of anomaly, C(,{A),
 and the diversitas, C7(A), are 79; 11° and 11 ;48°, respectively, whereas the values for

 the equation of anomaly, c(,(a), and the additive difference, c7(c*'), found in the PAT

 are 38; 1° and 3;45°, respectively. We note that Eqs. 39 and 40 hold, where kv(, =
 4I;10° and kvj = 8;3° (see Tables 14, 15). From Eq. 41, C(A) = 79;11°+ 11;48°
 (17/60) = 82;32°, whereas the PAT yield c(a) = 38;1° + 3;45°- (17/60) = 39;5°.
 Now, the true longitude derived with the standard Alfonsine Tables is
 X = 133;23,50° + 105;29° + 39;5° = 277;57,50° (see Table 8). On the other hand.

 from Eq. 37, D?(17) = 141;13,49° - 8;3°- 17/60 = 138;56,58° (see Table 12). Thus,
 L — 138;56,58° + 56;29° + 82;32° = 277;57,58°, in agreement with the previous
 result.

 Similarly, the general expression for the longitude of a planet near apogee is

 Displaced tables in Latin 37

 given as

 L = D5(M) + K + D(A) + C5(A)-C4(K), (45)

 and it can be obtained from the standard Alfonsine procedure

 A. — ko + k + C(,(a) - 05(a) ■ C4(k). (46)

 To be sure,

 A. = Xq + k + C6(a) - 05(a) • c4(k)

 = Xq + (K + kh4) + cfi(a) - c5(a) + c5(a) + 05(a) ■ c4(k)

 = Xo + (K + khi0 + D(A) - max(c6 - C5) + cs(a) + 05(a) ■ c4(k)

 = Xo + kh4 - max(c6 — C5) + K + D(A) + 05(a) ■ (1 + c4(k))

 — Xq + kh4 — max(c6 — C5) + K + D(A) + (Cs(a) — kvs) ■ C4(K)

 = A-o + kh4 — max(c6 — C5) + K + D(A) — kv5 ■ C4(K) + Cs(A) • C4(K)

 — Xo + kh4 — max(c6 — C5) — kvs ■ C4(K) + K + D(A) + Cs(A) ■ C4(K) = L,

 provided that Ds(M) = Xo + kh4 — max(c6 — C5) — kv5 ■ C4(K), which is the case:

 see Table 7 and Eq. 32. All terms appearing in Eq. 44 are positive and are found in the
 tables.

 To illustrate Eq. 44, consider the position of Mars at noon, October 1, 1340, when

 i< = 37; 31,6°, and thus the planet is near apogee. From Eq. 16 it follows that K =
 336;31,6° (where kh^ = 61°; see Table 5). In the PAT, the corresponding equation of
 center is c^(ic) = — 6;26,40°, whereas the tabulated equatio centri and equatioporcio
 nis for K = 336;31,6° are C3(K) = 5;33,20° and E(K) = 18;26,40°, respectively.
 We note that Eq. 18 holds, where kv3 = 12° (see Table 5). We also note that Eq. 27
 holds, where kh4 = 49° (see Table 6). Then, k = 31;4,26° because of Eq. 18, and
 K = 342;4,26° because of Eq. 19. In the PAT, the corresponding minutes of pro
 portion is c4(k) = —51/60, whereas the minutes of proportion tabulated here is
 C4(K) = 9/60. Therefore Eq. 24 holds, where kv4 = 60'. The mean argument of
 anomaly of Mars for that date is a = 27;35,24°, and thus the true argument of anom
 aly is a = 34;2,4°, because of Eq. 23, and A = 15;35,24°, because of Eq. 17, where
 kv3 = 12°. Therefore, A = 34;2,4°, because of Eq. 22. We note that A — a. In the

 PAT, the corresponding entries for the equation of anomaly and the difference at great
 est distance are c(,(a) — 13;26° and €5(0) — 0;48°, respectively. Thus, the total cor
 rection is c(a) = 13;26°+0; 48°(—51/60) = 12;45,12°. On the other hand, the tabu
 lated values for the diversitas dyametri and the equation of anomaly are C5 (A) = 6; 26°
 (we note that Eq. 35 holds, where kv5 = 5;38°: see Table 11) and D(A) = 49;23°.
 From Eq. 36 it follows that C(A) = 49;23° + 6;26° • 9/60 = 50;20,54°.

 Now, the true longitude derived with the standard Alfonsine Tables is
 X = 133;23,50° + 31;4,26° + 12;45,12° = 177; 13,28° (see Table 8). On the other
 hand, from Eq. 32, D5(9) = 145;38,49° - 5;38° ■ 9/60 = 144;48,7° (see Table 7).
 Thus, L = 144;48,7° + 342;4,26° + 50;20,54° = 177; 13,27°, in agreement with
 the previous result.

 In Table 16 we present a summary of the values for the displacements, both vertical
 and horizontal, applied by the anonymous author of the Tables of the Seven Planets

 to the Sun, the Moon, the 8th sphere, and the planets.

 13 Latitudes of the superior planets

 Folio 40r displays a table for the latitudes of the three superior planets (the inferior
 planets are addressed in a very different way on ff. 4 lr-46v: see Sect. 17, below). This

 table is in the Almagest tradition, and is found in many other sets of tables such as the
 zij of al-Battanl and the Toledan Tables (see Chabas and Goldstein 2012, Table 9.2B,
 p. 109). For the zij of al-Battanl, see Nallino (1903-1907); and for the Toledan Tables,
 see Toomer (1968) and Pedersen (2002).

 14 Planetary visibility

 On f. 40v there is a table entitled Tabula visionis et occultationis for the three superior

 planets and the two inferior planets. It is a table for the visibility of the planets, also
 called a table of planetary phases, which is already found in Almagest XIII. 10, as

 well as in many other sets of astronomical tables, such as the Handy Tables, the zij
 of al-Battanl, and the Toledan Tables (see Chabas and Goldstein 2012, Table 11.2,
 p. 125).

 On f. 40v there is a small table entitled Tabula latitudinis lune in principio medio etfine

 eclipsis, an excerpt of which we reproduce below (see Table G). The argument, which

 is the argument of lunar latitude, is presented in four columns and, as indicated in the
 title, it is restricted to the values for which an eclipse is possible, that is, ±13° from

 the lunar nodes. The purpose of the table is to show the correspondence between the

 argument of latitude and the latitude of the Moon, and the entries can be recomputed

 by means of the modern formula

 P = arcsin(sin/ • sinw),

 where co is the argument of latitude, f) is the latitude, and the i is the inclination of

 the lunar orb to the ecliptic, taken here as 5;0° (the same parameter as in the table for

 lunar latitude on f. 13r).

 16 Eclipsed fraction of the solar and lunar disks

 A table for the eclipsed fraction of the solar and lunar disks is also found on f. 40v. The

 argument ranges from 1 to 12 linear digits (where the diameter of the eclipsed body
 is 12 digits, and the entries are the corresponding areal digits (where the area of the

 eclipsed body is 12). It is very common in sets of astronomical tables, such as the zij
 of al-Battanl, the Toledan Tables, and it is already found in Almagest VI.8. However,
 this was not one of the tables included in the editio princeps of the Alfonsine Tables
 (see Chabas and Goldstein 2012, Table 15.4, p. 175).

 17 Latitudes of Venus and Mercury

 The tables for the latitudes of Venus and Mercury are presented as six sub-tables for

 each planet, on ff. 41r-43v and ff. 44r-46v, respectively. Both are double argument
 tables. The vertical argument (center) is given in four columns at 6°-intervals and

 altogether there are 30 columns for the horizontal argument (anomaly), also at 6°
 intervals. Each of these columns contains entries for the inclination (latitudo prima)

 and the slant (latitudo secunda). The deviation (latitudo tercia) is presented in another

 column, which remains invariant in all sub-tables for each planet. Table H displays an

 excerpt of the table for the latitude of Venus.

 The maximum values for Venus and Mercury are, respectively, 7;22° and 4;5° for

 the inclination, 2;30° and 2;30° for the slant, and +10' and -13' for the deviation.

 This table differs, strongly in presentation and slightly in the basic parameters, from

 tables by Parisian astronomers who included the third component of latitude, John
 Vimond and John of Murs.29 For the maximum values of deviation, Vimond had +10'

 and —45' (Ptolemy's values in the Almagest), for Venus and Mercury, respectively,
 whereas John of Murs had +10' and —23', in contrast to +10' and —13' in the tables

 reviewed here. John of Ligneres was aware of the deviation, for he mentions it in the
 chapters on the latitudes of Venus and Mercury in the canons of his Priores astrologi

 motus corporum celestium,30 but we do not know of any tables by him similar to those

 presented here. All in all, the tables for planetary latitudes in the Tables for the Seven

 Planets, although certainly in the same tradition, are not simply related to those by
 John Vimond and John of Murs, or by any other known table-maker.

 18 Conclusion

 Throughout the time from the reception of the Alfonsine Tables in Paris (no later than
 1320) to the publication of the editio princeps in 1483 in Venice, an intense effort

 was made to adapt tables in the Alfonsine framework to the needs of practitioners.
 These adaptations focused on presentation rather than on the parameters underlying

 the tables of the Alfonsine corpus of tables. The set of tables which we have called the

 Tables for the Seven Planets for 1340 is an early example of this kind of work, with

 zodiacal signs of 30° (rather than physical signs of 60°), vacillation in the beginning of

 the year, and cyclical radices of 32 years, with special characteristics such as displace

 ments, different parameter for the latitude of Mercury, and different terminology.

 Displaced tables in Latin 41

 The use of double argument tables and the extensive use of displacements, both
 vertical and horizontal, show a deep insight into planetary astronomy and great skill in

 producing astronomical tables. This set of tables is also the first example that has been
 discovered in the Latin world of a systematic use of displaced tables, of which only a
 few examples were previously known in the medieval astronomical literature. Unfor

 tunately, no name is associated with this set, but the author was an astronomer working

 around 1340, probably in Southern France (judging by the geographical coordinates
 underlying these tables), who deserves the highest praise for his skill in providing
 clever and complex solutions to many problems, and for constructing a compact and
 consistent set of tables for the planets, building upon the work done by the Parisian

 group of astronomers in the early 1320s.
