 The original motivation for Copernicus's research:
 Albert of Brudzewo's Commentariolum super Theoricas

 Abstract In 1454 Georg Peurbach taught astronomy at the Collegium Civium in
 Vienna by reading a work of his own: the Theoricae novae planetarum. In 1483
 Albert of Brudzewo, teaching astronomy at Cracow University, adopted Peurbach's

 text together with a commentariolum of his own. Among the numerous commentaries

 preserved both in manuscript and in printed form, Brudzewo's stands out because

 it submits Peurbach's work to a subtle analysis that, while recognising the merits
 for which it was widely accepted, also focuses on the limitations of the celestial

 spheres described in it. Budzewo's commentary is of interest, in itself both for its

 criticism of Peurbach's descriptions of solar, lunar and planetary theory and also for

 its importance to Copernicus's own planetary theory. For Copernicus makes clear in

 the Commentariolus that his concern was the very same issue, violation of uniform

 circular motion by the rotation of spheres, that Brudzewo criticises in detail. In this

 way, Brudzewo's commentary stands as the original motivation for the investigation of

 the motion of the planets that was eventually to lead Copernicus to a planetary theory

 based strictly upon uniform rotation of spheres, and through that investigation to the

 motion of the Earth and the heliocentric theory.

 The original motivation for Copernicus's research: Albert..

 363

 On the penultimate day of August 1454 at the Collegium Civium in Vienna, the

 Magister Georg of Peurbach completed a course on the Theoricae novae which he

 had written himself. This course constitutes a crucial moment in the history of astron

 omy. The thoroughness and scientific foundation of the Theoricae novae enable them

 to mark a significant turning point with respect to the previous tradition. They explain,

 in fact, the "new" image of the celestial world, which was to persist for at least two

 centuries and even withstood the innovations introduced by Copernicus. From an

 analysis of the existing testimonies, a picture emerges of how the Theoricae, rooted in

 the cultural fabric of the Latin West, became the indispensable foundation for higher

 astronomical knowledge in the main university centres of the time, especially in con

 texts where it was considered imperative to renew and restore the science of the stars.2

 Although they mark an important turning point, the Theoricae novae do not actu

 ally break with the previous tradition but instead form part of it since they compose

 in a coherent manner the various contributions developed in the previous centuries.

 Peurbach gathers in a global view of the universe the most innovative results of the

 tradition with regard to both with the internal structure of the planetary spheres and

 with the superior spheres whose motions involve the overall celestial globe. His work

 offers a coherent and well-structured presentation of the whole universe in all its parts

 and according to the composition of their motions, from the sphere of the Moon up to

 the Prime Mover, reconciling on one side, the need of transmitting the global motions

 through the concentricity of the spheres, and on the other side, the need of saving the

 apparent irregularities through the eccentrics and the epicycles. The Theoricae novae's

 universe is made of suitably structured orbs moving in an actual way and influencing

 one another through their movements.3 This explains why Peurbach points out that his

 Theorica nova explains the real structure of the celestial spheres and their motions:

 "Incipit theorica nova realem sperarum habitudinem atque motum [...] declarans".4

 Those orbs and those spheres for which Peurbach intended to be the description of

 the spherical reality draw their foundations from the Almagest. So, in order to place

 Peurbach's contribution in perspective and understand its value, it is useful to compare

 the Theoricae novae with the Almagest. One can then observe the different methods

 characterising these astronomical texts, opposing the tö δτ ι to the δ ιότ ι—or, to use

 the Latin expressions, the narrative exposition to the demonstrative—but it is also

 worth highlighting that they are closely related in terms of content.

 2 This results from the analysis of the extant manuscripts and printed editions spreading Peurbach's The

 oricae novae, alone or with commentary, from fifteenth to seventeenth century. Cf. (Malpangotto 2016 ä
 paraitre).

 3 For a description of the way in which Peurbach, in his Theoricae novae planetarum, presents the structure

 of the planetary spheres, see (Malpangotto 2013b). For an analysis of what distinguishes Peurbach's Theor
 icae novae from the previous tradition, see (Malpangotto 2016 ä paraitre). To insert Peurbach's contribution

 in the previous tradition, (Duhem 1913-1915, vol. Ill), (Grant in Lindberg 1978), (Lerner 2008), (Barker

 2011) remain the reference works and the following question in (Lemer 2008,1,120-121) is still opened:«

 Faut-il voir dans cette incorporation des cercles abstraits de 1 'Almageste dans des orbes solides, le risultat

 de la diffusion progressive d'un modöle de machinerie cileste dont les origines lointaines remontent ä

 Ptol£m6e lui-meme? On peut le penser. En tout cas, tout se passe comme si ce processus de diffusion, qui
 meriterait de faire l'objet d'une itude particuliöre, avait trouv£ chez Peurbach son aboutissement».

 Ptolemy's method in the Almagest is rigorously empirical and mathematical. The

 descriptions of the phenomena, of the apparent motions in the heavens, are based

 strictly upon observations and the derivation and confirmation of the planetary systems

 and their parameters from those observations upon strict mathematical demonstrations.

 The Theorieae, written by Peurbach in 1454, are considered an isagoge to the Almagest.

 In contrast to Ptolemy's highly detailed work with its extremely thorough presentation

 of the celestial universe, the Theoricae is very synthetic: through a sequence of state

 ments and simply enunciated rules, it presents a comprehensive view of the celestial

 universe in terms both of structure of the planetary spheres and also of the composition

 of their motions. All of this is based on the models that Peurbach extrapolated from

 the Almagest. Nevertheless, a major part of the Almagest is completely absent from

 his text, namely the geometric demonstrations and the description of the phenomena
 which are both the cause and the effect of its models.

 It is for this reason that once this work was adopted as the reference textbook

 for university teaching in the 1480s, explanatory commentaries had to be added. On

 the whole one can recognise that the majority of commentators, even though adopting

 different approaches5 share a common purpose. These authors remain faithful to Peur

 bach's text, which they examine in an uncritical way, and in its entirety, with the aim

 of explaining its content as thoroughly as possible, in order to prove that, even in this

 new structure, Peurbach's orbs always embody the mathematical rigour and precision

 characterising Ptolemy's work. By the rigour of the mathematical demonstrations, they

 support the consistency of the parts of the universe and the accuracy of the relations

 between the elements examined even when some of them remain purely geometrical

 abstractions interacting with the orbs of which the planetary spheres are made.

 Even if one focuses solely on the printed versions—omitting the names of the

 numerous masters who taught Peurbach's Theoricae novae in many universities,

 adding their own explanations, which have only reached us in manuscript form—

 the contributions of Francesco Capuano, Silvestro Mazzolini da Prierio, Oronce Fine,

 Peter Apian, Jacob Milich, Erasme Reinhold, Ε. Oswald Schreckenfuchs, Christian

 Wursteisen and others in centres such as Padua, Paris, Ingolstadt, Wittenberg, Freiburg

 and Basel.. ,6 increasingly strengthened and consolidated the coherence of the universe

 described in Peurbach's work. This accounts for the fact that the image of the world

 conceived by Peurbach persisted for at least two centuries.

 Nonetheless, the authority of Peurbach was by no means universally accepted. In

 Cracow the Theoricae novae were read in an original way according to an unusual

 approach by Albert of Brudzewo. It will be interesting to try to understand where

 the originality of the analysis developed by Brudzewo concerning the universe of the
 Theoricae novae does lie, and whether someone has indeed been motivated to make

 good use of his "unusual remarks".

 5 (Duhem 2003), (Jardine 1984), (Lerner 2008), (Barker 2011) considers, for exemple, the real or "fiction

 alist" interpretation of the celestial orbs adopted by different authors.

 6 Only the better known printed versions of the Theoricae novae are evoked here: (Capuano 1495), (Maz
 zolini de Prierio 1514), (Reinhold 1542), (Schreckenfuchs 1556), (Nunes 1566), (Wursteisen 1568). For a

 complete description of the spreading of Peurbach's work and a catalogue describing both manuscripts and

 printed editions transmitting the Theoricae novae from 1454 to 1653, see (Malpangotto 2016 a paraitre).

 2 Aims and method

 Our reading of Brudzewo's Commentariolum reveals that his analysis of the Theoricae

 novae is a singular one, distinguishing him from all the other authors who examined

 Peurbach's work. In this paper we will show firstly, in the section Albert ofBrudzewo's

 Commentariolum super Theoricas novas Georgii Purbachii, the criteria which guide
 Brudzewo's lectures on the Theoricae novae and how he recognises in the Theor

 ica Solis the embodiment of the first principle of astronomy. We will then consider

 the parts of the Commentariolum in which Brudzewo focuses on the weak points of

 Peurbach's universe. While examining the presence of Mathematical artifices in Peur

 bach's universe, we will consider his reflections on the equant circle and on the mean

 apogee: Peurbach derived both these elements from the Almagest but, according to

 Brudzewo, was unable to assimilate them to the spheres and orbs of the Theoricae.

 In distinguishing Real motions and apparent motions and considering the presence

 of irregular motions in Peurbach's universe, we will stress how Brudzewo demon

 strates that Peurbach has built a universe that does not respect the principles of the celes

 tial nature and in which a separation occurs between appearance and reality. In the name

 of the principle of the perfect circularity and uniformity of motions considered in itself

 and in an absolute sense "in se et absolute", Peurbach's statements attributing irregular

 motion to the celestial orbs are inadmissible. Brudzewo underlines that these equivo

 cal, problematic statements made by Peurbach derive from the position of the observer

 at the centre of the world. In his analysis he perceives the Weaknesses of Peurbach's

 approach: the astronomers' point of observation. This particular point of observation

 represents then a serious problem for the Theoricae's universe. Brudzewo grasps the

 serious weakness that could shake the very foundations of the whole structure of that

 universe. This gave rise to the question this paper seeks to answer: could the problems to

 which the Cracovian Magister drew attention, and his reflections thereon, have helped

 stimulate the quest for a new point of observation from which to practise astronomy?

 The presence, in the same years of Brudzewo and Copernicus in Cracow, opens

 the possibility that Copernicus, young student at that university, knew Brudzewo's
 Commentariolum. In an effort to answer this question, in the sections devoted to
 Copernicus' Commentariolus: a new point of observation and to Copernicus's De
 revolutionibus, we will show that without exaggerating one's interpretation of Coper

 nicus's work in any way, the same objections and the same reflections as those found

 in Brudzewo's work can be observed therein, although more concisely, and these were

 developed by the Frombork astronomer in the name of the same principles and to

 emphasise the same inconsistencies.

 Purbachii

 3.1 Brudzewo's teaching in Cracow

 In 1483 Albert of Brudzewo, an eminent figure at Cracow university, reformed the

 teaching of theoretical astronomy by basing his lectures on Peurbach's new work,

 which he illustrated through his own commentary:

 Μ. Malpangotto

 the brief commentary on the Theoricae novae of Georg Peurbach brought

 together by Master Albert of Brudzewo in the University of Cracow for a more

 appropriate introduction of younger students during a reading made of the same
 Theoricae novae.1

 At the end of his course he expresses his awareness of the unusual and innovative char

 acter that distinguishes his reading of the Theoricae novae and expresses an exhortation

 to bring further improvements:

 From the unusual remarks expressed in this Commentariolum that have been set

 forth not according to received doctrine and science, the diligent reader should

 not readily rise up in indignation, but let him apply himself to bring forth anew

 what is more certain and profound in furtherance of this science.8

 Manuscript sources prove that from that year until at least 1495, Brudzewo's commen

 tary on Peurbach's Theoricae novae became a reference work for astronomy studies at

 the Faculty of the Arts of that University.9 Brudzewo was among the first Magistri to
 take an interest in the Theoricae novae. His Commentariolum is also the most ancient

 commentary on Peurbach's work to have been printed, with two editions in 1494 and

 in 1495, thanks to the contribution of one of his students.10

 7 L,f. 69r;R,f. 79r;D, f. 149v; K, 189r. For a Latin transcription, see the "Appendix". In 2013, in the same
 month of May, two studies on Brudzewo's Commentariolum appeared: (Barker 2013) and (Malpangotto

 2013a). Barker considers the vexed question of the reality of the celestial orbs to suggest that the common

 view of modern commentators, who usually depict Brudzewo as a fictionalist denying the physical reality of

 the orbs described by Peurbach in his Theoricae novae planetarum, "is an error based on selective reading

 and ignoring the context in which Brudzewo was writing". (Malpangotto 2013a) presented the first French

 version of our analysis of Brudzewo's text, which we here develop in more detail.

 8 L: f. 69r; R: 79r; D: 149v; K: 189r. For a Latin transcription see the "Appendix".

 9 The explicit of L confirms that Brudzewo's teaching dates back to the year 1483: "Dictum est anno domini

 Millesimo quadringentesimo octogesimo tertio". The Liber diligentiarum of the Arts Faculty starts with

 year 1487 and does not enable to know the teachers for the previous period. According to Birkenmajer in

 (Brudzewo 1900: XXVII), the manuscript annotation saying "1483 Brudzew legit", in the margin of f. sign.

 a3 ν of the 1495 printed version Inc. 2705 of the Jagiellonian Library, confirms that in 1483 Brudzewo read
 his Commentariolum.

 The same explicit in L also says that the text of the Commentariolum was made public to students in 1488:

 "Scriptum vero et in publicum editum anno domini Millesimo quadringentesimo octogesimo octavo". This

 same course should be the one written in manuscripts, R, D, Κ (see "Appendix").

 The Liber diligentiarum of the Arts Faculty of Cracow (Wislocki 1886: 5) reveals that Brudzewo gave a

 course on the Theorica planetarum in 1488. So he taught the commentary copied in these manuscripts.

 Manuscript C confirms that the Commentariolum is still read at Cracow University in 1493: "finitum in

 vigilia Circumcisionis domini a. d. 1493 Finis". For this semester, the Liber diligentiarum says that the

 Theorica planetarum was taught by Simon Sierpc (Wislocki 1886: 23).

 10 The Commentariolum was first printed in Milan in 1494 by the printer Uldericus Scinzenzeler (M in the

 "Appendix"; unknown to Birkenmajer). All the extant copies of this edition Μ lack any f. ai and Brudzewo's

 name does not appear anywhere in the volume. In 1495, the same printer published a second edition of the

 Commentariolum (E in the "Appendix" and in Brudzewo 1900). The titlepage on f. [ai]r does not mention
 Brudzewo's name. In the dedication letter, at f. [ai]v, Johannes Otto de Valle Uracense says that this is

 Brudzewo's work and states that Brudzewo was his praeceptor and the printer's colophon at f. sign, [g

 viii]v explicitly attributes the work to Brudzewo.

 367

 3.2 General approach of Brudzewo's reading

 In his commentary, Brudzewo does not adopt a uniform approach. He does not treat

 all the subjects of the Theoricae novae uniformly. Sometimes he refers directly to
 Peurbach's words: "what the text [of Peurbach] says is proved as follows",11 "it is

 shown in the text [of Peurbach]"12 and leaves the original text and diagrams to explain

 certain matters: "The Magister [Peurbach]'s text is sufficiently clear and evident look

 ing at the diagram";13 in other places he merely describes the contents by means of a

 paraphrase, whereas the subjects in which he is particularly interested are described

 at length. His analysis pays particular attention to the part of the Theoricae devoted

 to the planets.14 In general Brudzewo followed the same order adopted by Peurbach

 and examined the celestial spheres in the following order: the Sun;15 the Moon;16 the

 three superior planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn17; Venus18 and Mercury.19 He also

 retained the internal division of each chapter, by devoting the first part to a description

 of the orbs that comprise the total spheres; the second part to the movement of each

 orb considered both in itself and in relation to the Sun; and the third part to the terms

 for using the tables.20

 Ptolemy's astronomy is a constant presence in the whole of Brudzewo's work, and

 he regularly refers to the Almagest, from which he quotes entire passages in full,

 or indicates the book and the chapter in which Ptolemy discusses a specific subject.

 In this way he establishes the foundations of the orbs of the Theoricae novae and

 shows how they embody the mathematical precision and rigour of the Greek work.

 Brudzewo starts each section of his commentary by presenting the phenomena that

 persuaded Ptolemy to introduce the eccentrics and the epicycles. He then shows how in

 the Theoricae novae the same phenomena, which, in the Almagest could be imagined

 as the result of the abstract combination of purely geometrical circles, can also now

 occur through these particular structures of "partial orbs", that is, orbs forming the

 parts of an entire sphere made up of such orbs. In this sense Peurbach avoided the

 disadvantages that until then could only exist in the purely mathematical abstraction:

 11 (Brudzewo 1900: 23): "Littera autem taliter probatur". With "littera" Brudzewo always refers to the text
 of Peurbach's Theoricae novae.

 12 (Brudzewo 1900: 47): "probatur in littera". As usual, with "littera" Brudzewo always refers to the text
 of Peurbach's Theoricae novae.

 13 (Brudzewo 1900: 84): "Sequens etiam littera Magistri satis plana est et evidens in figura". Usually with
 "Magister" Brudzewo is referring to Georg Peurbach.

 14 Brudzewo's Commentariolum is divided into three parts: the Tractatus primus has no title in the man

 uscripts, but it concerns the texts about the Sun, the Moon and the planets (Brudzewo 1900: 22-127),

 while the titles of Tractatus secundus: De passionibus planetarum (Brudzewo 1900:128-145) and De motu

 octavae sphaerae tractatus (Brudzewo 1900: 146-151) appear in the extant manuscripts.

 15 (Brudzewo 1900: 22-44).

 16 (Brudzewo 1900: 44-78).

 17 (Brudzewo 1900: 78-107).

 18 (Brudzewo 1900:107-110).

 19 (Brudzewo 1900: 110-127).

 At the beginning of each section of his commentary, Brudzewo presents this structure which is common

 to each section of Peurbach's text. See (Brudzewo 1900: 22,44,78,107,110).

 he has deconstructed the motions which, in the Almagest, are carried out by a single

 circle, which even turned in opposite directions, preferring instead to assign each of

 these motions to one single orb conceived for this purpose.

 3.3 The criteria which guided Brudzewo's reading

 Brudzewo makes a careful and accurate analysis of the text of the Theoricae novae.

 He interprets it according to his own personal beliefs. This is made possible by the

 way in which Peurbach explains his universe, presenting it in almost mechanical

 functionality, like a perfectly functioning machine, without any explicit reference to

 the question of the a priori principles imposed by natural philosophy. The initial

 lines of the Commentariolum demonstrate clearly that for Brudzewo, the "partial

 orbs" described by Peurbach are real:21 "the eccentric is a real orb"22 and the "total

 sphere" of each planet is made of "real partial orbs."23 To Brudzewo, the universe that

 Peurbach describes in all its constituent parts, must reflect the image of the celestial

 world as it is in its reality. It must then represent the part of nature that must necessarily

 embody the perfection in which the regular, uniform revolutions take place. These
 revolutions:

 take place without any irregularity, since this motion is an essential attribute of
 the celestial bodies whose motion is different in nature to that of bodies in the

 sublunary world, whose motion is devoid of uniformity and order.24

 This world is governed by precise, rigorous laws, and established a priori principles

 to which Brudzewo constantly refers his analysis, since he considers that they are the

 most authentic expression of the essence of celestial nature. Thus, each celestial body

 must have its own unique motion which is performed in a perfectly uniform, circular

 manner; the same principle, in mathematical terms, requires each celestial body to

 move through equal angles centred on its own centre of motion, corresponding to

 equal arcs of the circular path through which it passes in equal intervals of time.25

 21 This conviction is regularly repeated and becomes particularly evident each time Brudzewo has to present

 the astronomical terms and the lines determining them in geometrical terms. In these passages he notices

 that Peurbach transforms the arrangement of the real orb carrying the celestial body into an imaginary

 circle represented on a plane: "In fact, the Theoristae, who know the real orbs' arrangement, habitually

 subordinate to these real orbs some imaginary circles which resemble them and which are arranged in the

 same way that finally each one, which imitates such an arrangement, be exposed to sight in a plane, for,

 as Ptolemy says, sense perception frequently aids the intellect to investigate. Sensus enim saepius adiuvat

 intellectum ipsum speculari inquit Ptolemaeus. » (Brudzewo 1900: 34); cf. also 57, the commentary to

 "Vocatur autem superficies".

 22 (Brudzewo 1900: 57): "lam Magister, posita declaration ecentrici, qui est orbis realis, [...]".

 23 (Brudzewo 1900: 22): "In prima parte ponit Magister divisionem totius sphaerae solaris in orbes reales

 partiales [...]".

 24 (Brudzewo 1900: 79-80): "[...] in revolutionibus, quae esset absque diversitate qualibet. Talis enim

 motus est quasi proprietas conveniens corporibus coelestibus, alienatis a natura istorum inferiorum, quorum

 motus [est] absque similitudine et ordine

 25 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 23): "Omnem motum coelestis corporis simplicem et verum aequalem esse,

 hoc est, super aequos angulos in centre motus consistentes et in arcus cadentes aequales, aequalibus
 fieri temporibus". This passage faithfully recalls the same words taken from the third book of the

 Brudzewo requires the perfect circularity and uniformity, demanded by Ptolemy for

 the motion of his abstract, purely mathematical circles, to be observed by the motion

 of the orbs conceived by Peurbach. And his assessment of the models in the Theoricae

 novae relies on agreement with these principles.

 3.4 The Theorica Solis and astronomy's first principle

 The Sun is the first to be examined in the Theoricae and it is similarly the first to be

 found in Brudzewo's Commentariolum. When describing the structure of its sphere

 in terms of partial orbs, Brudzewo refers to Peurbach's text "Littera autem taliter

 probata·".26

 Peurbach describes the motion of the orb carrying the Sun, saying that:

 But the orb carrying the body of the Sun moves by its own motion about its

 centre, namely, the centre of the eccentric, uniformly in the order of the signs

 about 59 minutes and 8 seconds each day of the degrees of the circumference

 described through the centre of the body of the Sun in one complete revolution,

 f...] Now, since the centre of the Sun moves uniformly about the centre of the

 eccentric in accordance with the motion of the orb carrying it, necessarily it will

 move nonuniformly about any other point. Therefore, in equal times the Sun

 describes unequal angles about the centre of the world and unequal arcs of the
 circumference of the zodiac.27

 Brudzewo approves this, since the regular motion of the Sun in its eccentric constitutes

 the foundation of astronomy, without which any consideration of this matter becomes

 impossible. The validity of this principle is also confirmed by mathematical rigour:

 The Sun in equal times decribes equal angles about its centre [of the eccentric]

 and cuts off equal arcs [of the eccentric]; therefore it moves uniformly.

 Brudzewo call this the "first principle of astronomy" and defines it rigorously:

 Although that the Sun moves uniformly in its eccentric is the first principle in

 astronomy, so that when it is denied, there is nothing more to be considered in

 astronomy, nevertheless, such a principle can be demonstrated by a subordinate

 science, namely, mathematics, in this way: The Sun in equal times decribes equal

 instead of using Alton's translation of the third edition of the Theoricae novae.

 angles about its centre [of the eccentric] and cuts off equal arcs [of the eccentric];

 therefore it moves uniformly.28

 In Brudzewo's description of this sphere he explains the "quod", that is the reasons

 the eccentric orb had to be included for this luminary, and also how the Theoricae's

 arrangement of orbs prevents any intrusion of the vacuum and break in the celestial

 spheres.

 Brudzewo draws attention to the optimal atmospheric conditions in the regions

 inhabited by the most ancient astral observers. He affirms the reliability of results

 achieved in a particularly limpid environment where nothing could disturb their obser

 vations.29 On the basis of these observations, the ancient astronomers, particularly the

 Egyptians and the Chaldeans, "concluded that the Sun moves nonuniformly in the
 zodiac".30 Nevertheless:

 Even though the Sun itself moves by an irregular motion in the zodiac, they

 judged, from the principles of philosophy, that it ought to move in its orb with a

 uniform and simple motion.31

 These ancient astronomers were then faced with two truths: one which was shown

 by the senses, that is the irregular motion of the Sun in the zodiac as it appeared to

 an observer at the centre of the world; and the other, which was based on an a priori

 principle, that is the circular and uniform motion of the Sun in the eccentric orb in

 which it had really to rotate:

 And thus, pondering these two alternatives in the mind, namely, the irregular

 motion of the Sun in the zodiac, but the uniform and regular motion in its orb,

 they reasoned: If the Sun itself would have its orb concentric to the zodiac, it
 would in fact also move uniformly in the zodiac [...] And thus since the Sun

 moves irregularly in the zodiac, not finding a cause more suitable, they assigned

 eccentricity to the orb of the Sun, by which the eccentric is raised in one direction

 from the centre of the world, approaching toward the zodiac, but in the other

 direction it will approach towards the centre of the world, withdrawing from the

 zodiac. For in this way the Sun will be seen to move irregularly in the zodiac,

 and remain longer in one half [of the zodiac] than in the other.32

 28 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 30-31): "Etsi Solem in suo ecentrico regulariter moveri sit primum principium in

 Astronomie (ideo cum negante illud, non est amplius in Astronomia disputandum), tarnen tale principium

 potest per scientiam subalternantem, scilicet mathematice demonstrari sic. Sol in temporibus aequalibus,

 aequales super centrum suum describit angulos et aequales resecat arcus, ergo aequaliter movetur."

 29 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 27-28).

 30 (Brudzewo 1900: 23): "concluserunt Solem in zodiaco inaequaliter moveri."

 31 (Brudzewo 1900: 23): "Et cum ipse Sol diverso motu et inaequali moveatur in zodiaco, senserunt

 ipsum—ex prineipiis philosophiae—debere moveri in suo orbe, aequali motu et simplici."

 32 (Brudzewo 1900: 23-24): "Haec itaq ue duo prae oculis pensantes, diversum scilicet motum Solis in
 zodiaco, uniformem vero et aequalem in suo orbe, arguebant: Si ipse Sol haberet suum orbem zodiaco
 concentricum, de facto etiam moveretur in zodiaco aequaliter [...] Cum itaque Sol in zodiaco moveatur

 irregulariter, causam non invenientes magis consonam, ecentricitatem orbis solaris assignaverunt, qui qui
 dem ecentricus in una parte elevabitur a centro mundi ad zodiacum accedendo, in altera vero ad centrum

 mundi appropinquabit, removendo se a zodiaco. Hoc namque pacto Sol videbitur in zodiaco irregulariter
 moveri et in una medietate morari diutius quam in altera."

 Since the observations demonstrated that the motion of the other planets in the

 zodiac was also different and varied from one another, it was necessary to introduce

 an eccentric orb for them too. The ancient observers of the stars inquired whether all

 the other spheres were eccentric:

 They found that the starry sphere is concentric to the world. They proved this

 through the Pleiades and the other stars diametrically opposed to Pleiades,

 namely, that when the Pleiades rise, the other stars set, and the converse. These

 same observers also saw that the motion of the seven planets was different and

 varied from one to another. Thus, if the eighth sphere is concentric and the planets

 among themselves move according to different motions, if their orbs were sup

 posed to be totally eccentric, then between the eighth sphere and the sphere imme

 diately below it, by reason of the different motion, there would occur a division of

 the spheres and the intrusion of a void, and the same would apply to all the infe

 rior spheres as well, which appeared to them absurd to suppose, for otherwise the

 heaven would be corruptible. Therefore, they could not save entire spheres eccen

 tric in themselves, [... ] Therefore, these two contrary motives troubled them, one,

 on account of which they were compelled to apply the eccentric orb of the Sun

 to the other spheres of the planets, the other, that if entire [orbs] were totally

 eccentric, a division between the spheres would be permitted. Considering this

 from both sides, they did not find anything more suitable than that in every sphere

 there are at least three orbs arranged in the way the [Peurbach's] text says.33

 Brudzewo does not name the person who conceived the solution to this problem, keep

 ing this vague by referring to those ancient astronomers who considered that the more

 appropriate solution was to adopt, for each planet, a single complete sphere concentric

 to the eighth sphere and comprising, in the case of the Sun, three partial orbs "taliter

 dispositi, ut inquit littera": arranged as described in the Theoricae novae text. Here

 Peurbach's authority reappears. The sphere of the Sun has a specific internal structure

 made up of an eccentric orb and two surrounding orbs which are of variable thickness.

 In Peurbach's conception the surrounding (circumpositi) orbs of variable thickness

 prevent the generation of the division and the intrusion of a void inside the total

 sphere. The specific structure of these orbs surrounding the eccentric comes from the

 necessity of enabling the motion of the eccentric carrying the Sun or the epicycle
 of the other planets. Because of their shape, they are called "eccentric in a certain

 sense", since they are only eccentric in one of the surfaces which contain them. In

 33 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 25): "Amplius imaginati scrutatique sunt, an foret conveniens ipsi Soli hunc

 unicum habere orbem ecentricum et quaerebant, si omnes sphaerae essent ecentricae: invenerunt quidem,

 quod sphaera stellata est mundo concenrica. Istud enim probaverunt per Pleiades et alias stellas Pleiadibus

 diametraliter oppositas, videlicet, quod quando Pleiades oriebantur, illae occidebant, et e converso. Viderunt

 insuper motum Septem planetarum, diversum et varium inter se. Si ergo octava sphaera est concentrica

 et planetae inter se moventur motibus diversis, positis eorum orbibus totaliter ecentricis, profecto inter

 sphaeram octavam et inter sibi immediate inferiorem, ratione motus diversi accideret scissio sphaerarum
 et commixtio vacui; et sic in aliis sphaeris inferioribus. Quod eis videbatur absurdum sentire, alias enim

 coelum esset corruptibile. [...] Movebant ergo eos duae causae contrariae: una propter quam coacti sunt
 ponere ecentricum orbem Solis cum ceteris planetarum sphaeris, altera quia si totae ecentricae fuissent,

 scissio sphaerarum committeretur. Hinc inde revolventes, non invenerunt aliquid magis consonum, nisi
 quod in unaquaque sphaera essent tres orbes ad minus taliter dispositi, ut inquit littera."

 defining their movement Peurbach characterises these orbs as having propriis motibus

 proporcionalibus, "their motions so proportioned" that the "thinner part of the superior

 orb always is above the thicker part of the inferior one".34 Brudzewo cannot restrain

 expressing his personal disappointment by dwelling on this character of proportionality
 in their motions:

 Now from this, that the principal centre of these orbs is the centre of the world,

 around which the motion of the eighth sphere takes place—which motion of

 the eighth sphere is in fact common to all the lower spheres and is passed in

 equal amount and in one and the same way (aequaliter et uniformiter) to them—

 therefore they have a motion in the amount proper to each {proportionalem) so

 that the thinness of one does not depart from the thickness of the other, nor the

 contrary. Further, the motion of any heavenly body [and then of each orb] about

 its centre is uniform, as was said, and the objection of some is of no effect,

 namely, that because these two orbs have with respect to one surface the centre

 of the world, but with respect to the other [surface] the centre of the eccentric,

 therefore if they move about the centre of the world, they will in a like way move

 about the centre of the eccentric. They say, therefore, it is inconceivable that the
 same orb move with the same motion about different centres. But in truth it is not

 incongruous, for on account of this, that they have different centres with respect
 to their different surfaces, the motions of the orbs themselves, in accordance

 with their different surfaces, can be assigned to different centres. Nevertheless,

 it would not be without incongruity that an orb, having this kind of disposition
 in both its surfaces, move with the same motion about different centres.35

 In the end Brudzewo's disagreement is clearly expressed. If the eccentric orb carrying

 the Sun is in complete correspondence with the law of motion, the "eccentric in a certain

 sense" orbs, which necessarily must be in the planetary spheres, lead Brudzewo to an

 initial reflection which highlights how this aspect of Peurbach's real universe holds an

 inconsistency between the concept of the perfection of motion, as Brudzewo conceives

 it with its own laws, and the motion of these orbs for which only the proporcionalibus

 motion is valid. Even though Brudzewo does not repeat his critique in the rest of his

 commentary, it applies to all the other orbs "eccentric in a certain sense", since at least

 one pair of orbs of this kind is found in each planetary sphere, and Mercury even has

 two pair of them.

 34 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [lv]): "Moventur autem orbes deferentes augem Solis propriis motibus propor

 cionalibus itaquod semper strictior pars superioris sit supra latiore inferioris." (Brudzewo 1900:29) criticise

 the improper character of the adjective "propriis" that Peurbach attributes to the motion of these orbs.

 35 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900:29-30): "Ex hoc enim, quod horum orbium principale centrum sit centrum mundi
 [...] ideo habent motum proportionalem, sic quod moles unius crassitudinem alterius non derelinquit,

 nec e converso. Cuiuslibet etiam corporis coelestis circa centrum suum motus est aequalis, ut dictum est,

 nec procedit instantia quorumdam, videlicet quod isti duo orbes quoad unam superficiem habent centrum

 mundi, quoad alteram vero centrum ecentrici; ergo si movebuntur super centra mundi, simili ratione super

 centra ecentrici. Dicunt ergo: esse inimaginabile,eumdem orbem eodem motu super diversis centris moveri.

 Sed revera non est inconveniens. Ex hoc enim quod habeant diversa centra respectu diversarum suarum

 superficierum, motus ipsorum orbium secundum diversas eorum superficies ad diversa centra referri possunt.

 Orbem tamen, in utraque superficie similis dispositionis, eodem motu super diversis centris moveri, sine
 inconvenient! non esset."

 4 Mathematical artifices in Peurbach's universe

 Whenever Ptolemy's astronomy is consistent with the Theoricae novae's orbs,
 Brudzewo accepts, illustrates and comments on these passages. Unfortunately the The

 oricae novae do not always represent the perfect transposition of Ptolemean geometry.

 When those orbs cannot explain certain celestial phenomena, Peurbach is compelled to

 maintain some of Ptolemy's mathematical abstractions. Thus, in his universe there are

 some circles and points to which, in perfect agreement with the Almagest, he attributes

 a fundamental function: they become the "rule of regularity"36 to which one can refer

 the irregular motions of the real orbs.

 In stating the role of these artifices, Peurbach assigns them such an important func

 tion that Brudzewo cannot fail to give attention to them and their role in this universe.

 If Brudzewo had commented on Ptolemy's mathematical astronomy in the Almagest,

 he would not have found any reason to criticise these artifices because all the discus

 sion would have remained on a purely geometrical level. Instead, he gives Peurbach

 the credit for his work in inserting Ptolemy's mathematical astronomy into a universe

 of orbs that really move and which have a physical effect on one another through the

 movement of their parts.37 He then considers where Peurbach retained certain math

 ematical elements derived from Ptolemy and attributed them an active role within the

 physical spheres. Brudzewo cannot avoid criticising these compromises, which conflict

 with what he expects to find in the Theoricae. He is particularly explicit in concerning

 the equant, which, according to Peurbach, represents the "rule of regularity" for the

 motion of the eccentrics and the epicycles of the planets, and the mean apogee as the

 index of regularity for the motion of the celestial bodies in their epicycles.

 (a) The equant

 In the fifth chapter of book IX of the Almagest Ptolemy specifies that the planets'
 epicycles do not physically move in the equant circle, that is in the eccentric circle in

 relation to whose centre, at twice the eccentricity of the eccentric, they move regularly

 through equal angles in equal intervals of time.38 Instead they move in their own circle,

 which is different from the equant, around their own centre, which is different from

 the equant's centre, and here their motion is irregular. In the Ptolemaic approach this

 statement cannot be criticised as it refers exclusively to purely geometric circles whose

 function is purely for calculation purposes. The context in which Peurbach refers to

 the equant is completely different. He explicitly distinguishes between orbs and the

 "circulus imaginatus", called the equant eccentric:

 36 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [6v]): "Haec tarnen difformitas hanc regularitatis habet normam

 37 For a description of these influences in the case of the sphere of Mercury, see (Malpangotto 2013b:
 278-294).

 38 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900:85-86): "inquit Ptolemaeus dictione IXna capitulo 5t0: Et centra orbium revolutio

 ns neque revolvuntur super hos orbes centrorum egredientium, quorum centra per motus suos revolvuntur

 in revolutione aequali et perambulant in temporibus aequalibus angulos aequales. Haec ille."
 Brudzewo transcribes this passage of the Almagest which, as mentioned above, he knows from Gerard of
 Cremona's Arabo-Latin version (cf. Ptolemy 1515: f. 103r). It should be noted that Brudzewo remains

 faithful to this Arabo-Latin version in which the circles of the Almagest are systematically called "orbs".

 Μ. Malpangotto

 the motion of the orb carrying the epicycle around its own centre and on its axis

 is nonuniform. However, this irregularity has the following rule of regularity: the

 centre of the epicycle moves regularly with respect to a certain point of the line

 of the apogee, as far from the centre of the eccentric as this centre is distant from

 the centre of the world. And thus this point is called the centre of the equant, and
 the circle imagined (circulus imaginatus) about it, in accordance with the size

 of the deferent and in the same plane with it, is called the equant eccentric.39

 Brudzewo remarks that, in the Theoricae, the equant always has a purely mathe

 matical function. He states that:

 insofar as it pertains to the motion of the orbs in itself, the equant is not necessary.

 The equant does not affect the motion of the real orb at all, since it is a circulus

 imaginarius. But it is useful in astronomical work or for the calculation of tables,

 which are calculated according to mathematical principles and conclusions that

 very frequently cannot be attributed or applied to the motions as they are in their

 nature or as they appear.40

 According to Brudzewo mathematicians must inevitably subject the motions of the

 celestial bodies to their art and calculations, since they cannot give a precise, regular

 representation of these motions in any other way.41 Hence the equant becomes the ratio,

 the reason by which the apparent irregularity of the motions is reduced to regularity:
 by knowing how much to add or subtract to a regular motion which is calculated

 purely on the basis of the observations, the equant enables astronomers to locate the

 epicycle's positions at any time in order to achieve the aim of astronomy:

 And then, through regular motion [the astronomers] know to what extent irregu

 lar motion is greater or lesser than regular motion in terms of the size of the angles

 or arcs which need to be added or subtracted: this is why they assume equants.42

 Brudzewo continues his analysis:

 According to the astronomers, the motion, which is in reality seen to be irregular,

 instead becomes regular in order to make it possible to calculate it in a more

 39 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [6v]): "Motus autem epicyclum deferentis super centro et polis suis difformis est.

 Haec tarnen difformitas hanc regularitatis habet normam ut centrum epicycli super quodam puncto in linea

 augis tantum a centro huius orbis quantum hoc centrum a centro mundi distat elongato: regulariter moveatur.

 Unde et punctus ille centrum aequantis dicitur et circulus super eo ad quantitatem deferentis secum in eadem

 superficie imaginatus eccentricus aequans appellatur."

 40 (Bnidzewo 1900: 86): "Quantum est in se, ad motum orbium non est opus aequante. Nihil enim aequans

 facit ad motum orbis realis, cum sit circulus imaginarius, sed quantum ad opus astronomicum, seu ad

 calculationem Tabularum, quae calculantur iuxta principia et conclusiones mathematicas, quae quidem con

 clusiones, quia saepius non possunt accomodari et applicari motibus, ut sunt in sua natura, seu ut apparent."

 41 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 86): "Ideo ipsi Mathematici quandoque capiunt alio modo motus corporum
 coelestium, quam sunt in sua natura, vel aliter quam apparent, et considerant eos tali modo, qualiter serviunt

 eorum arti et operationi, cum alio modo nullatenus eos ad opus rectum et praecisum possent ponere."

 42 (Brudzewo 1900: 87): "Et sie per motum aequalem iterum cognoscunt, quantum motus diversus maior

 itate aut minoritate planorum angulorum et areuum addat aut diminuat supra motum aequalem: propter hoc

 ergo ponuntur aequantes."

 precise manner. This conviction meant that they have to put in the equants:

 some circuli imaginati with reference to which they make the varied, irregular

 motions of the orbs regular. These reduce those irregular motions to regularity

 in the equant circles [.. .]43

 In this reflection he highlights the paradoxical situation which arises in the Theoricae's

 planetary spheres, where the eccentric orb carrying the epicycle actually turns, but in

 an irregular manner around its own centre, whereas the regularity of its motion is

 referred to a different point, that is the centre of this "circulus imaginatus" which is

 the equant: a circle, which is distinct from the orb itself and quite different in nature,

 since it is just a geometrical circle and does not belong to the physical reality. A single

 motion is thus divided with regard to its quality and its essence: the irregular motion,

 which belongs to the real orb; and the regular motion, which instead belongs to the

 purely mathematical abstraction.

 This duality, in Brudzewo's view, suggests that there is a contradiction in the Theor

 icae's universe, since every part of this universe must be a physical embodiment of the

 perfect uniformity of all motion. But if adopting the equant satisfied Peurbach that he

 had found regularity of motion through a purely mathematical "rule", Brudzewo's crit

 icism of the equant is not confined to rejecting it as a mathematical tool: his rejection

 takes on a more substantial connotation since Peurbach, by adopting the equant, has

 violated the very essence of celestial nature with its principle of uniformity, according

 to which the celestial bodies must move uniformly around the centre of their motion.

 (b) The mean apogee: the Moon's epicycle

 Brudzewo's disagreement with Peurbach for having resorted to purely mathematical

 abstractions also involves the mean apogee of the lunar epicycle: a geometrical point

 from which first Ptolemy and then Peurbach calculate the mean motion of the Moon in

 its sphaerula, that is in its epicycle. Peurbach defines and explains the mean apogee's
 function as follows:

 Nevertheless, the epicycle revolves in such a way that it moves irregularly around

 its own centre and axis, but this irregularity is reduced to regularity in as much as

 the Moon regularly moves away from the mean apogee of the epicycle, whatever

 this may be, by about 13 degrees and 4 minutes each natural day. The mean
 apogee of the epicycle is the point of the epicycle's circumference which is

 located by drawing a line from the point of the small circle which is diametrically

 opposite the centre of the eccentric through the centre of the epicycle.44

 43 (Brudzewo 1900: 86): "Imaginantur ergo aequalem esse motum, qui non aequalis videtur in se, propter

 opus ut rectius ponant. Et ex hoc convicti sunt et coacti ponere aequantes, circulos imaginatos, super quibus

 motus orbium diversos et inaequales, aequales esse considerant, reducuntque illos motus diversos primum

 ad aequalitatem in aequantibus, tamquam in id, ex quo iudicium diversi motus sumpturi sunt."

 44 (Peurbach [1472]: ff. [4r-4v]): "Circumvoluitur tarnen epicyclus taliter ut super centra proprio atque axe

 irregulariter moveatur. Sed haec irregularitas ad uniformitatem reducitur istam ut a puncto augis epicycli

 mediae, quicunque sit ille, quolibet die naturali tredecim gradus et quatuor minuta fere recedendo regulariter
 elongetur. Aux autem media epicycli est punctus circumferentiae epicycli quem ostendit linea a puncto

 diametralster opposite centro eccentrici in circulo parvo per centrum epicycli ducta."

 Brudzewo explains how the early astronomers succeeded in determining this point.

 He also shows how it fulfils its function. In doing this he adds further information
 to Peurbach's text and shows how, here too, the Theoricae's universe is based on

 the models in the Almagest. As for the equant, also for the mean apogee, he clearly
 draws attention to how Peurbach was unable to reconstruct the Moon's motion, which

 appeared to be irregular, through actual motions of real orbs, and had to resort to

 mathematical artifices which, as with Ptolemy, remained pure abstractions which could

 not have any actual interaction with the physical reality of the Theoricae's orbs.

 Through their observations, the ancients noticed that the motion of the lunar body

 is irregular. So it was impossible to locate the Moon's true position at any given time

 and it became necessary to find a method which allowed them to do this by finding

 the Moon's regular motion in its epicycle45 and through their observations of lunar

 eclipses estimating its daily mean motion.46 They then discovered and proved that the

 arc of the Moon's true motion in its epicycle compared to its mean motion is sometimes

 greater and sometimes smaller:

 So by means of demonstrations they found out that the arc of the epicycle,

 included between the line of mean motion of the centre of the epicycle and the

 centre of the Moon, [that is, its true motion,] is sometimes greater and sometimes

 smaller than the arc of the Moon's mean motion [previously calculated] 47

 By the "mean motion [previously calculated]", is meant the mean motion of the Moon

 already determined for the simple lunar model, derived by Ptolemy from the interval

 between eclipses. Thus, the mathematici had to find an effective method of trans

 forming those irregularities into a uniform motion. In order to do this "Mathematici

 imaginatos fingunt circulos" the mathematicians conceived imagined circles: they con

 sidered a circulus imaginatus described by the lunar body as it traversed its epicycle.

 They fixed a precise point on this circle that is always invariatus, invariable or fixed,

 with respect to which the Moon moved regularly in its epicycle. This point is called

 "aux media" mean apogee or "longitudo longior aequalis" mean greatest distance, to

 employ Ptolemy's expression 48

 The mean apogee of the epicycle is the point marked on the circulus imaginatus by

 a line drawn from the point of the "small circle" diametrically opposite the centre of

 Footnote 44 continued

 The "small circle" to which Peurbach refers, is determined by the motions of the secundum quid orbs and

 from the repositioning of their mass. Even if the sphere of the Moon has a different structure, it is the same

 mechanism which makes the centre of the eccentric carrying Mercury's epicycle describe a "small circle"

 too. For an explanation of this, see (Malpangotto 2013b: 279-292).

 45 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 62-66).

 46 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 66): "Sic enim operati sunt antiqui, videlicet quod primo invenerunt revolutiones

 epicycli aequales et motum Lunae in epicyclo aequalem per considerationes eclipsium lunarium." See also
 (Brudzewo 1900: 46-47).

 47 (Brudzewo 1900:66): "Tandem demonstrationibus experti sunt arcum epicycli, inter lineam medii motus

 centri epicycli et inter centrum Lunae interceptum, esse maiorem aut minorem arcu medii motus Lunae in
 epicyclo."

 the eccentric passing through the centre of the epicycle.49 It is an index of regularity:
 the line marking it is directly and strictly linked to the motion of the centre of the

 epicycle, and indirectly linked to the motion of the centre of the eccentric. So this

 line causes this point of the mean apogee, to oscillate continually in longitude, and

 the point's motion is one of declinatio et reflexio, here meaning a turning forward and

 turning back, inclining in one direction and another with reference to the true apogee.

 The true apogee lies on a line from the Earth passing through the centre of the epicycle
 extended to the far side of the epicycle:

 it is evident then that, while the centre of the epicycle goes from the apogee of

 the eccentric to the perigee, the true apogee of the epicycle precedes the mean

 apogee and, while the centre of the epicycle goes from the perigee to the apogee,
 then the true apogee follows the mean apogee.50

 circle which it describes; Ε point of the small circle diametrically opposite to D; C centre of the epicycle;

 Brudzewo treats this subject in some detail in one of the more difficult passages of

 the Theoricae novae. His concern is the functioning of this purely abstract artifice,

 the mean apogee, depending upon the rather complex geometry of points, lines and

 circles in order to produce the regularity of the Moon's motion through a motion of

 turning forward and turning back of the mean apogee. The aim of his commentary is

 to show how this component, like the equant, is not explained by Peurbach's physical

 universe of spheres, even though the Viennese astronomer makes them interact with

 the real parts of the Theoricae's universe.

 Nevertheless, his commentary is not wholly negative and Brudzewo also proposes

 a possible solution to this defect in order to build as real a universe as possible. Thus

 for the Moon, he proposes replacing the geometry of the mean apogee and the line to

 the point opposite the centre of the eccentric with a solution that involves real orbs.

 Referring to a passage in which Ptolemy describes the appearance of lunar phases,

 Brudzewo states that the oscillation of the mean apogee itself is a motion of turning

 forward and turning back:

 In these words Ptolemy appears to intimate that the turning forward and turning

 back arises not from computation alone, but from an apparent motion truly in the

 Moon. For by reason of this turning forward and turning back, the Moon follows

 certain appearances after its drawing away from the Sun, namely, that it appears

 concave or hollowed out, and this about the fifth day after conjunction. It also

 appears swollen, or gibbous, and this about the tenth day after conjunction.51

 Brudzewo explains that a second epicycle is imagined in order to save these specific

 appearances that the Moon assumes at these times in its revolution in relation to the

 Sun: this second epicycle would make the epicycle carrying the Moon accomplish a

 motion of turning forward and turning back:

 Therefore, in order to save this apparent motion in the Moon, some imagine an

 epicycle in the Moon of such a kind that will have another [epicycle] enclosed

 within it, which [outer] epicycle moves the epicycle carrying the Moon in a

 motion of turning forward and turning back, which does not seem unsuitable.52

 The solution conceived by these astronomers, who Brudzewo does not name, could

 then be made of two concentric epicycles, with the outer epicycle actually oscillating

 with the mean apogee. In the figure that follows we show this solution by adding an

 outer epicycle and its motion to Ptolemy's lunar model. To explain the lettering, Ο is
 the Earth, S the mean Sun, Μ the Moon, D the centre of the eccentric with apogee

 51 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900:67): "Videtur [Ptolemaeus] in istis verbis innuere, quod declinatio et reclinatio non

 ex sola computatione proveniat, sed ex motu realiter apparenti in Luna. Luna enim ratione istius declinationis

 et reflexionis consequitur quasdam figuras post elongationem eius a Sole, videlicet quod apparet concava,

 seu excisa, et hoc circa quintum diem fere post coniunctionem. Apparet etiam tumida vel gibbosa, et hoc
 circa decimum diem fere post coniunctionem."

 52 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 67-68): "Propter ergo salvare istum motum apparentem in Luna, quidam imag

 inantur epicyclum talem in Luna, quod habeat alium intra se inclusum, qui movet epicyclum deferentem

 Lunam motu declinationis et reflexionis, quod non videtur esse inconveniens." The two figures drawn by

 Birkenmajer from C, L and E, although they differ in detail, show two concentric epicycles, one inside the

 other. There are also figures of lunar phases, including concave and gibbous.

 A and perigee Β, Ε the point opposite the centre of the eccentric, C the centre of the

 epicycle, G the true apogee lying on line OCG, F the mean apogee on line ECF. The
 centre of the epicycle C moves through the mean elongation η from S, the centre of
 the eccentric D moves in the opposite direction through ή from S, and the Moon Μ
 moves on the epicycle through the mean anomaly k from the mean apogee F. The
 correction of the anomaly on the epicycle is c\ and the correction to the true position
 of the Moon seen from Ο is C2

 Our concern here is the description of the motion of F, which has a turning forward
 and turning back. The principle here is that an outer epicycle, within which is the
 epicycle carrying the Moon, has an oscillating motion, turning forward and turning
 back, carrying with it the inner epicycle, so that the mean apogee F lying on ECF
 departs from the true apogee G lying on OCG, in the motion of the centre of the
 epicycle C from A to B, first in the direction GF and then back to G, and in the
 motion of C in the other half of the eccentric, from Β to A, not shown here, first in the

 opposite direction beyond G and then back to G. In this way, what is only geometry
 in Ptolemy's model, F having an inclination towards E, lying on the line ECF, is
 now actually produced by a real motion of a real spherical body, an oscillating motion
 of the outer epicycle that is transferred, added to, the rotational motion of the inner

 epicycle, which thus has both the rotation through k and the oscillation through c\, so

 the motion of the Moon Μ with respect to the true apogee G is k ± c\. What was just

 geometry has now become the real motions of real spherical bodies, of two concentric
 epicycles.53

 53 Thanks to Noel Swerdlow we could formulate this model and give a graphical representation.

 Μ. Malpangotto

 Note that a difficulty in interpreting this passage has been introduced by a marginal

 note, that interprets the second epicycle as having an entirely different purpose:

 Some imagine that the Moon has two epicycles, one larger, the other smaller, in

 which [i.e. the smaller] its [the Moon's] body is placed, and such that the higher

 [i.e. larger, outer] epicycle moves only with the motion of turning forward and

 turning back. And as far as concerns that spot, which is observed in the Moon, it

 always appears one and the same on account of this epicycle, which would not

 occur if there were not such an epicycle.54

 This refers to the same spot, or spots, on the Moon always facing the Earth, which is

 incompatible with Brudzewo's description of the function of the outer epicycles, as its

 motion of turning forward and turning back cannot cause the same side of the Moon

 to face the Earth. It does not appear to be part of Brudzewo's text, and its inclusion

 as a marginal addition, perhaps by someone who did not understand Bruzewo's own

 description, is in error, or is at least extraneous, and has led to confusion in interpreting

 the purpose of the second epicycle, which, again, cannot cause the same side of the
 Moon to face the Earth.55

 (c) The mean apogee: the superior planets' epicycle

 In the analysis devoted to the three superior planets Brudzewo makes the same criticism

 he addressed to the mean apogee of the Moon, and in the same terms. The main

 difference is just the starting point of the line which marks the mean apogee of the

 epicycle: for the Moon it is the point of the "small circle" diametrically opposite the

 centre of the eccentric; but for the superior planets it is a fixed point, that is, the

 centre of the equant circle. His analysis of the mean apogee of the superior planets

 aims to show clearly how this pure geometry is not in itself sufficient to the reality of

 the celestial orbs. The epicycle of each planet is in fact deep in the concavity of the

 eccentric that contains it, and its surface touches the superior concave surface of the

 eccentric orb at one point. This point is called the "point of concavity" and always

 remains unchanged being on the line from the centre of the eccentric passing through

 54 (Brudzewo 1900:68, n.l): "Lunam quidam imaginantur habere duos epicyclos, unum maiorem, alteram

 minorem, in quo est eius corpus situatum, et ita epicyclus superior tantum, motu declinationis et reflexionis

 movetur. Et pro tanto ilia macula, quae in Luna aspicitur, semper una et eadem apparet propter istum

 epicyclum: quod non esset, si talis epicyclus non esset." This passage is found in the margin of f. 51r in L

 in the hand of the scribe and a similar annotation, literally different but on the same subject, is in the margin

 of f. 61v in R.

 55 Grazyna Rosinska's research on the astronomy teachers at Cracow University in the first half of the

 fifteenth century enabled her to find a double epicycle for the Moon, in Sandivogius de Czechel's commentary
 on the Theorica planetarum Gerardi written in about 1430, which appears to be for this purpose. See
 (Rosinska 1974, 1973). The description appears to be of a second small epicycle surrounding the Moon

 itself that causes its body to rotate, not the two concentric epicycles described in Brudzewo's text. Brudzewo's

 text and the marginal annotation have also been considered by (Barker 2013: pp. 137-139), who reaches
 the same conclusion, that Brudzewo describes two concentric epicycles for the motion of the mean apogee

 of the epicycle and that these cannot cause the same side of the Moon to face the Earth.

 the centre of the epicycle.56 The line from the equant point passing through the centre

 of the epicycle locates a point on the epicycle called the mean apogee "from which

 the uniform motion of the plant in the epicycle is to be computed". Brudzewo remarks

 that because of the motions in each planetary sphere, the geometrically determined

 point that is the mean apogee continually changes its position with respect to both the

 concave surface of the eccentric, the concavity at which the epicycle is located, and

 to the convex surface of the epicycle itself. The point of the mean apogee, however,

 remains "invariable" if one considers it as a mathematical point on the circumference

 of the circulus imaginatus produced by the motion of the planet in its epicycle:

 Therefore, the planet in the epicycle will now have a regular and uniform motion

 about the centre of the equant, from which a line drawn through the centre of

 the epicycle show the point from which the uniform motion of the planet in

 the epicycle is to be computed, which [point] is called the mean apogee. The

 mean apogee is variable with respect to the concavity in which the epicycle is

 located, as it continually is under one and another point of that concavity. The

 mean apogee is also variable with respect to the actual convex surface of the

 epicycle itself such that it continually passes under one and another point of the

 surface of the real epicycle on account of the motion of the epicycle. However,

 the mean apogee does not vary with respect to the circumference imagined on

 the epicycle, in which the planet's motion and its revolution are calculated, for

 it is necessary that the point of the mean apogee is always one and the same in

 any location for the reasons which were stated in the case of the Moon.57

 This explanation by Brudzewo aims to give a clear picture of the interaction between

 the mean apogee considered purely mathematically and the real structure of the celes

 tial spheres. Adhering consistently to the criteria which guide his reading, what

 emerges from the analysis concerning the equant and the mean apogee is the way

 in which considering these physically rather than just mathematically is a serious

 problem for the universe as described by Peurbach.

 5 Real motions and apparent motions

 Peurbach brought the irregularity of the motions of his orbs back to regularity

 through the equant and the mean apogee of the epicycle. As we have seen, in his

 analysis Brudzewo does not restrict himself to the function of those mathematical

 artifices for astronomical calculation, but goes beyond Peurbach to show the reality

 56 (Schreckenfuchs, 1556, pp. 120-121) says this for the superior planets referring to the more explicit

 explanation given for the Moon at pp. 58-61.

 57 (Brudzewo 1900:94): "Ideo planeta in epicyclo iam habebit motum regulärem et uniformem super centro

 aequantis, de quo linea ducta per centrum epicycli ostendit punctum, a quo computandus est aequalis motus

 planetae in epicyclo, qui Aux media appellator. Quae quidem Aux media variabilis est quoad concavitatem

 illam, in qua situatur epicyclus, sic videlicet, quod continue sub alio et alio puncto sit concavitatis, vel

 etiam variabilis est in superficie convexa real! ipsius epicycli, ideo, quod continue alius et alius punctus

 superficiei realis epicycli succedit propter motum epicycli; non autem variabilis est quoad circumferentiam

 imaginatam in epicyclo, in qua motus planetae et revolutio computantur."

 of the orbs that produce those motions, to a deeper understanding of the Theoricae's
 universe.58

 The same observed phenomena described in the Almagest, which determine the

 circles that make up each specific planetary model, are described in Brudzewo's Com

 mentariolum, where they now determine the partial orbs that form the models in the

 Theoricae novae. Indeed, Brudzewo describes the various appearances that require

 the eccentrics and epicycles for each planet, and also provides detailed reasons for

 adopting the other partial orbs. In this way, he demonstrates the reasons "quod" that

 determined the structure of these particular planetary spheres. In the sphere of the

 Moon and of the five planets, the star is fixed onto a sphaerula —the epicycle—which

 is carried by the eccentric. The eccentric orb, located between the two surrounding

 (circumpositi) orbs of variable thickness, turns around its own centre and carries the

 epicycle through its own complete revolution according to its own period peculiar to

 each planet. The zodiac is the band of the eighth sphere on which the motions of the
 celestial bodies are seen. The centre of the zodiac is the centre of the world, from

 which the centre of the eccentric is at a fixed distance, different for each planet.

 In considering the movement of the celestial bodies one must therefore consider two
 kinds of motion:

 - the real motion, the motion the eccentric orb actually performs carrying the epicycle

 and the motion the epicycle performs carrying the star located within it;

 - the apparent motion, the motion of the epicycle and the motion of the star in the

 epicycle seen in the zodiac from the centre of the world.

 Brudzewo always has in mind the distinction between the real universe, which by its

 nature is the realm of perfection and immutability where the motions are perfectly

 circular and uniform, and the phenomenal universe, as it appears on the band of the

 zodiac to an observer placed at the centre of the world. There is a close relationship

 between the real universe and the phenomena for which, according to Brudzewo,

 the real world must have its own identity and its own characteristics, to which the

 phenomenal world is subordinate, since it is the reflection of the composition of the

 motions of celestial reality.

 6 The irregular motions in Peurbach's universe

 The text of the Theoricae novae is very concise and simply defines the quality of the

 motions of the orbs that carry the bodies of the planets and of the luminaries. From

 Peurbach we only know that:

 (a) The eccentric carrying the Moon's epicycle, although it moves on its own axis and

 around its own poles, it does not move about them regularly: "quamvis eccentricus

 epicyclum deferens super axe atque polis suis moveatur, non tamen super eisdem

 regulariter movetur";59

 58 See supra the analysis of Mathematical artifices in Peurbach's universe.

 383

 (b) The eccentric carrying the epicycle of each of the planets around its own centre

 and its poles is nonuniform: "Motus autem epicyclum deferentis super centra et

 polis suis difformis est";60

 (c) The epicycle carrying the Moon moves irregularly around its own centre and

 axis: "Circumvoluitur tarnen epicyclus taliter ut super centra proprio atque axe
 irregulariter moveatur."61

 (d) The epicycle carrying each of the planets moves irregularly around its own centre:

 "[Huius motus] est super centra epicycli irregularis."62

 To each of these celestial bodies Peurbach assigned an irregular motion and thus

 built a universe that contrasts with the true nature of the real world. On this subject,

 Brudzewo's reading of the Theoricae novae proves once again to be a singular one. He
 stands out from the other commentators, who in their desire to confirm all Peurbach's

 statements, provide demonstrations with the sole intention of supporting, in an uncrit

 ical manner, the correctness of these assumptions, even on a subject as important as
 this one.

 Brudzewo cannot accept these assumptions since he considers that the Theoricae

 novae's universe must be the description of the celestial world as it really is, and the

 motions that take place in that world must reflect the perfect circularity and uniformity

 imposed by the principles. Consequently, Peurbach's assumptions are not true. Nev

 ertheless, he does not deny them categorically, and his analysis becomes particularly
 subtle because the subject under discussion enters the most essential part of Peur

 bach's universe. Orb by orb he tries to understand the logic underlying the reasoning

 that led the Viennese astronomer to establish an almost universal irregularity in the

 perfection of the celestial world. It was only once he had proved that these statements

 were founded on ambiguity, and thus only after he had invalidated the absoluteness
 of those assumptions, that Brudzewo could confirm that the motions of the celestial

 bodies, when considered "in se et absolute", in themselves and in an absolute sense,

 are rigorously uniform. He could therefore declare that:

 (a) If the motion of the eccentric carrying the epicycle of the Moon is considered in

 an absolute sense, that is, as it is on its axis and on its poles and about its centre,

 without referring it to the zodiac, then its motion is regular: "si motus ecentrici

 Lunae absolute accipiatur (prout scilicet est in suo axe et polis et circa centrum

 ecentrici, non referendo ad Zodiacum), sic motus eius est regularis";63

 (b) If the motion of the eccentric carrying the epicycle of each planet is considered

 in itself and in an absolute sense, then de facto it is uniform: "motus deferentis

 epicyclum, in se et absolute consideratus, de facto uniformis est"64;

 (c) If the motion of the epicycle carrying the Moon is considered simpliciter in itself

 and in an absolute sense, in respect only of its own centre and not in relation to

 any other point, then it is uniform: "epicyclus [movetur uniformiter] circa centrum

 suum, quod quidem verum est considerando motum epicycli simpliciter in se et

 absolute, sine relatione ad aliquem punctum"65;

 (d) If the motion of the epicycle carrying each of the planets is considered simpliciter

 in itself, then it is uniform.

 In the following exposition we will try to bring out the elements upon which
 Brudzewo's critical analysis is based.

 (a) The eccentric carrying the epicycle of the Moon

 To describe the motion of the eccentric carrying the Moon's epicycle Peurbach states
 that:

 even if the eccentric carrying the Moon's epicycle moves around its own axis

 and its own poles, it does not move about them regularly.66

 In the Theoricae novae's universe the epicycle of the Moon, in its apparent motion, is

 seen to move through the zodiac uniformly while its real motion in its eccentric orb

 is nonuniform. To describe the motion of the eccentric carrying the epicycle of the

 Moon, Peurbach says:

 The orb carrying the epicycle moves regularly about the centre of the world in

 the order of the signs, such that the centre of the epicycle moves through about

 13 degrees and 11 minutes each natural day.67

 In these words Peurbach pointed out the direction and the regularity of the motion of
 the Moon's eccentric in relation to the centre of the world: he has then defined the

 apparent motion of the Moon's epicycle.

 In the analysis of the Sun's sphere, which Brudzewo had just completed, he noticed

 that the Sun, in the Theoricae's universe, realises the essence of celestial nature and

 its principles: its motion is actually performed in its eccentric uniformly and the

 irregularity of its apparent motion is the result of its eccentricity to the centre of the
 universe. So it is natural for Brudzewo to state that:

 the Sun moves uniformly in its eccentric is the first principle in astronomy, so

 that when it is denied, there is nothing more to be considered in astronomy.68

 The Sun actually represents a reference for all the celestial bodies and in particular
 for their motions. Brudzewo recalls Peurbach's remark that:

 65 (Brudzewo 1900: 65).

 66 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [3r]): "quamvis eccentricus epicyclum deferens super axe atque polis suis moveatur,

 non tarnen super eisdem regulariter movetur."

 67 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [2v]): "Orbis vero epicyclum deferens movetur secundum successionem signorum

 regulariter super centro mundi ita quod omni die naturali tali motu centrum epicycli XIII gradus et XI
 minuta fere perambulet."

 68 (Brudzewo 1900:30):"[...] Soleminsuoecentricoregularitermoveri sitprimumprincipiumin Astrono

 mia (ideo cum negante illud, non est amplius in Astronomia disputandum), [.. .]".

 The original motivation for Copernicus's research: Albert.

 385

 Because of their motion, each of the six planets has a natural connection with

 the Sun: the latter's motion is as though a kind of mirror for each of them, and

 a rule for measuring the motions of the planets

 in order to underline how the motions of the orbs carrying the apogee and the orb

 carrying the Moon's epicycle have "a natural connection with the Sun".69

 Addressing himself directly to his students, he explained how anyone can derive the

 regularity of the apparent motion of the Moon's epicycle in relation to the Sun:

 you too can calculate it by proceeding in this manner: multiply the motion that

 the Sun performs in a day by the period of a month and add 360 degrees to the

 product, and there will result the degrees covered by the centre of the epicycle

 in a month. Divide this sum by the period of a lunation [a synodic month] and in

 the quotient you will find how far the centre of the epicycle, or the [orb] carrying

 the epicycle, moves uniformly each day in the zodiac.70

 In fact he goes on to specify that:

 with the aid of mathematics, it is possible to demonstrate that the epicycle's

 centre moves regularly about the centre of the world. Indeed, in relation to the

 line of the Sun's mean motion the centre of the epicycle forms equal angles about

 the centre of the world and covers equal arcs of the zodiac in equal intervals of

 time. This means that it moves regularly, just as [Peurbach's] text says, namely,

 13 degrees 10 minutes, etc.71

 This regularity is referred to the elongation between the line of the Sun's mean motion

 and the line of the mean motion of the epicycle of the Moon.72 For Peurbach this

 regularity of motion becomes the premise from which he deduces the irregularity of

 the epicycle's real motion, which he expresses in a first corollary:

 69 Cf. (Peurbach [1472]: f. [9v]): "Ex his igitur et dictis superius manifestum est singulos sex planetas
 in motibus eorum aliquid cum Sole communicare: motumque illius quasi quoddam commune speculum
 et mensurae regulam esse motibus illorum." Peuibach only introduces this concept in the section devoted
 to the sphere of Mercury, while Brudzewo brings it forward in the De Luna section. (Brudzewo 1900:

 57): "Hie iam [Magister] determinat de motu eorumdem [Augem deferentium et epicyclum deferentis] per
 comparationem ad Solem, cum quo Luna et ceteri planetae in motibus suis naturalem habent connexionem,

 [...]". He then notices that this idea had already been expressed by Haly in his commentary on the first
 book of Ptolemy's Quadripartitum.

 70 (Brudzewo 1900: 54):"[...] et tu etiam poteris reperire sic. Motum Solis, quem habet Sol in uno die per

 tempus unius mensis multiplica et producta 360 gradus adde: sic enim provenient gradus, quos centrum

 epicycli percurrit in uno mense. Hoc itaque aggregatum per tempus unius lunationis divide, et in quotiente

 habebis, quantum centrum epicycli, seu deferens epicyclum, movetur quolibet die naturali motu aequali in
 Zodiaco."

 71 (Brudzewo 1900: 54): "Ex his etiam, centrum epicycli moveri aequaliter super centro mundi, mathe

 matice ostendi potest, scilicet per respectum ad lineam medii motus Solis, respectu cuius circa centrum

 mundi aequales constituit angulos, et aequales in temporibus aequalibus de Zodiaco resecat arcus. Ergo
 movetur aequaliter, sicut dicit littera, scilicet 13 gradibus 10 minutis etc.". It is useful to note that Peurbach

 gives "about 13 degrees and 11 minutes."

 7^ The line of the Sun's mean motion is the line drawn from the centre of the world to the zodiac, parallel
 to the line of the Sun's motion in its eccentric. The line of the mean motion of the Moon's epicycle is the

 line passing through the centre of the epicycle, drawn from the centre of the world to the zodiac.

 Μ. Malpangotto

 From these premises it follows that, although the eccentric carrying the epicycle
 moves around its axis and its poles, nevertheless, it does not move around them

 regularly.73

 Thus, Peurbach then inserted irregular motion into the perfection of celestial reality,

 and this is just the first of a series of declarations of irregularity which he also extended

 to the eccentrics of all the planets and to the epicycles carrying both the body of the
 Moon and the planets.

 Brudzewo could not remain impassive in the face of these declarations and refused

 to comment on the text of the Theoricae in an uncritical way. He tried to reconstruct

 the underlying logic that guided Peurbach in his deductions. Not only does Peurbach
 state that the real motion of the Moon's epicycle is irregular in its eccentric and in

 relation to its centre, but he also shows how this can be proved geometrically:

 In fact, if equal angles are marked about the centre of the world towards the

 apogee and the perigee [of the eccentric], the angle that is towards the apogee
 includes an arc of eccentric greater than [the arc included by] the other angle
 towards the perigee.74

 A

 C

 By following Peurbach's instructions one can mark the circumference representing the

 zodiac centred in Τ as ABCD, and the circumference representing the eccentric centred
 in F, as GHLM, with the apsidal line AC with apogee G and perigee L. According to

 73 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [3r]): "Ex istis sequitur primo quod quamvis eccentricus epyciclum (sic) deferens
 super axe atque polis suis moveatur, non tarnen super eisdem regulariter movetur."

 Peurbach, if equal angles ATB and DTC are taken at the centre of the world T, the arcs

 they determine on the zodiac AB and CD are equal, but the arcs they determine on the

 eccentric are not equal, with arc GH towards apogee greater than LM towards perigee.

 Hence, in equal intervals of time, measured in terms of equal angles at the centre of
 the world Τ, the centre of the epicycle covers unequal arcs on the eccentric circle:

 according to Peurbach, this means that the motion of the epicycle in its eccentric is

 irregular. But, according to Brudzewo, the regularity of the motion of the epicycle in
 its eccentric must be referred to the centre of the eccentric F, not to the centre of the

 zodiac Τ. Having grasped the ambiguity which had misled Peurbach, Brudzewo can

 affirm in his commentary that:

 the first corollary has truth, namely, that the eccentric moves irregularly about

 its own axis and poles, and about its own centre, but—Brudzewo adds—only if
 its motion in the zodiac is evaluated in relation to the centre of the eccentric and

 not in relation to the centre of the world.75

 But in a second corollary Peurbach further specified how an irregularity such as this

 occurs:

 Second [corollary]. The closer the Moon's epicycle is to the deferent's apogee,

 the more rapidly its centre will move, and the closer it is to the perigee of the

 same deferent, the more slowly [its centre will move].76

 This is shown in the figure where arc GH is greater than arc LM and both are traversed

 by the centre of the epicycle in the same time, a second inconsistency, which does

 not escape Brudzewo's refined analysis. Peurbach has not, in fact, kept the circles and

 the corresponding centres about which the motions take place rigorously distinct: the

 zodiac, on which one observes the apparent motion of the epicycle; and the eccentric,

 in which the epicycles' real motion takes place. Instead he has subordinated all the rela

 tionships between these two circles while keeping the observation point unchanged,

 and he has evaluated the different motions in relation to one unique point, the centre of

 the world Τ. With respect to this unique observation point, he also deduced the greatest

 or smallest velocity of real motion: unequal arcs on the eccentric correspond to equal

 angles at the centre of the universe, that is to say, that at equal intervals, evaluated

 about the centre of the world, the Moon's epicycle will actually sometimes be faster

 and sometimes slower in its eccentric, that is in the orb where it actually moves and

 around the centre of its motion, because the smaller arc of the eccentric near perigee

 will be covered by the epicycle at a slower speed than the greater arc of the eccentric

 near apogee, covered in a faster speed, both arcs traversed in equal intervals of time.

 Thus, Peurbach had confused apparent motion with real motion or rather assimilated
 the two.

 75 (Brudzewo 1900: 55): "Corellarium primura habet veritatem, scilicet quod ecentricus super axe suo et

 polis et circa centrum suum movetur irregulariter, motum ipsius in Zodiaco computando respectu centri
 ecentrici et non respectu centri mundi."

 76 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [3r]): "Secundo quanto epicyclus lunae augi deferentis eum vicinior fuerit tanto
 velocius centrum eius movetur et quanto vicinior augis eiusdem opposito tanto tardius."

 Having clarified the ambiguities on which Peurbach's statements are based,
 Brudzewo could confirm with absolute certainty that the true nature of the eccen

 tric orb carrying the Moon's epicycle, as with all celestial bodies, should be expressed

 through perfectly circular and uniform motions around its own centre, which Peurbach
 has not done. In fact, "if the motion of the eccentric of the Moon is considered in an

 absolute sense, that is, as it is on its axis and on its poles and around the centre of the

 eccentric, without referring it to the zodiac, then its motion is regular":

 si motus ecentrici Lunae absolute accipiatur (prout scilicet est in suo axe et

 polis et circa centrum ecentrici, non referendo ad Zodiacum), sic motus eius est

 regularis.77

 (b) The eccentric carrying the epicycle of the planet

 The superior planets—Mars, Jupiter and Saturn—are seen moving in an irregular way

 in the zodiac in different ways: in their latitudinal movements, their longitudinal paths,

 and in relation to the Sun. Brudzewo draws the description of these irregularities from

 the Almagest's text, which he quotes in full to underline that the planets have an

 irregular motion in relation to both the zodiac and the Sun:

 In these words Ptolemy explains how the five wandering stars or planets have an

 irregular motion in the zodiac because they sometimes move north of the ecliptic,

 sometimes south of it, and sometimes in the ecliptic; sometimes [they move]

 slowly and sometimes rapidly. Also, with respect to the Sun they have an irregular

 motion, for when they were seen near the Sun, their motion, especially of the

 three superior planets, appeared fast, when near quadrants from the Sun, they
 were seem not to move but to stand still, that is, their motion was so insensible

 that they were said more to stand still than to move, and when they were in the

 diameter [opposition] to the Sun they were directed opposite to the signs.78

 To describe the motion of the eccentric carrying the epicycle of the planets Peurbach
 states that:

 The motion of the [orb] carrying the epicycle [of each planet] around its own

 centre and its poles is nonuniform.79

 77 (Brudzewo 1900: 55).

 78 (Brudzewo 1900:79): "Et hoc patet per Ptolemaeumdictione IX capitulo 2do, ubi inquit: In inquisitione

 vero diversitatum ingreditur ex dubitatione non parum propterea, quod videntur cuiusque stellarum duae

 diversitates, quae non sunt aequales, neque in magnitudine, neque in temporibus reditionum, quarum una

 videtur propter Solem et altera propter partes orbis signorum. Et cum coniunxerimus eas ambas, erit semper

 proprietas cuiuscumque earum propter illud difficilis cognitionis. Haec ille. In istis verbis Ptolemaeus
 vult quomodo quinque stellae erraticae, seu planetae habent diversum motum in Zodiaco, quia moventur

 aliquando versus septemtrionem, aliquando versus meridiem ab ecliptica et interdum vero sub ecliptica,

 aliquando motu tardo, aliquando veloci. Respectu etiam Solis habent diversum motum. Cum enim videbantur

 prope Solem, eorum motus [...] apparebat velox, cum circa quadras a Sole non moveri quidem sed stare
 videbantur, [...] et cum in diametro fuerunt cum Sole, contra signa tendebant."

 Once again Peurbach introduced irregularity into the realm of perfection and, in no

 uncertain terms, Brudzewo explicitly declares the falseness "non est verum" of this:

 What the Magister [Peurbach] says, that the centre of the epicycle moves irreg

 ularly around the centre of the eccentric, is not true if considered in absolute

 terms.80 This would in fact be in contradiction with the principle which states

 that each motion of a celestial body is simple and uniform, and in contradiction

 with the philosophia according to which the motion of a simple body must be

 simple and uniform. So the motion of the orb carrying the epicycle, considered

 in itself and in an absolute sense, is actually uniform.81

 Once again he reveals how Peurbach's remarks about his own universe derive from the

 fact that he confused apparent motion with real motion. "What the Magister [Peurbach]

 says" is true only in this particular, partial interpretation of these motions: that is, when

 the motion of the eccentric is evaluated from some point of observation inappropriate

 with regard to its real motion—as the centre of the world is with regard to the eccentric

 orb.82 But in Peurbach's text this distinction does not appear, and he describes the orb

 carrying the epicycle in itself without defining its relation to anything else:

 the motion of the [orb] carrying the epicycle [of each planet] around its own

 centre and its poles is nonuniform.83

 In this absolute sense he attributes irregular motion to the orbs which carry the epicy
 cles.

 (c) The epicycle carrying the Moon

 To describe the motion of the epicycle which carries the Moon Peurbach states that:

 The epicycle turns in such a way that it moves irregularly around its own centre
 and axis.84

 In Peurbach's text there is no misunderstanding, the irregularity of the motion of the

 epicycle occurs with respect to its own axis and to its own centre, but for Brudzewo

 80 (Brudzewo 1900:85): "Quod Magister dicat: centrum epicycli super centro ecentrici irregulariter moveri,

 non est verum intelligendo simpliciter." Simpliciter is used here in the same sense as absolute, taken by
 itself, and is translated in the same way.

 81 (Brudzewo 1900: 85): "Hoc enim esset contra illam maximam, qua dictum est, omnem motum corporis

 coelestis simplicem et aequalem esse, et contra philosophiam, quae corporis simplicis et regularis motum
 ponit simplicem ac regulärem. Et sic motus deferentis epicyclum, in se et absolute consideratus, de facto
 uniformis est [...]".

 82 Cf. (Brudzewo 1900: 85): "Et hoc quidem esse verum, videlicet quod centrum epicycli habeat diversum
 motum in suo ecentrico [...]".

 83 (Peurbach [1472]: ff. [6r-6v]): "Sed orbis epicyclum deferens super axe suo axem zodiaci secante

 secundum successionem signorum movetur [...] Motus autem epicyclum deferentis super centro et polis
 suis difformis est."

 irregulariter moveatur."

 Μ. Malpangotto

 this contradicts the principle of celestial reality. For the epicycle of the Moon, he cites

 Campanus of Novara:

 According to Campanus, the Moon moves in its epicycle in a regular motion,
 and the epicycle does the same, around its own centre. And this is certainly

 true if one considers the motion of the epicycle simpliciter in itself and in an

 absolute sense, without reference to any point, for uniform motion pertains to
 each celestial orb because of its nature.85

 In fact, Campanus never writes in his Theorica planetarum that the motion of the

 Moon in its epicycle is uniform in an absolute sense, only that it is uniform with

 respect to the mean apogee, so it is curious that Brudzewo uses Campanus as witness

 to his own principle that the motion of the epicycle is uniform in an absolute sense and

 with respect to its centre.86 Nevertheless, with this statement, the absolute uniformity

 of motion is recognised as intrinsic to the essence of celestial nature. Brudzewo makes

 no further reference to the principle, but appeals directly to the authority of nature:

 that "uniform motion is proper to each celestial orb because of its nature."87

 But Peurbach considers the motion of the epicycle, not in an absolute sense and with

 respect to its centre, but with respect to another point:

 what the Magister [Peurbach] says, that the epicycle turns in an irregular manner,

 is also true with regard to a sight (aspectum) situated at the centre of the world.88

 Peurbach ascribed irregularity to the epicycle carrying the Moon because he had

 evaluated its motion by reference to an improper point, a motion that by its nature

 is absolutely uniform becomes irregular if it is considered "with regard to a sight

 situated at the centre of the world". The misunderstanding is still the same, but this

 time the centre of the world becomes "the sight" of the observer. Here Brudzewo offers

 confirmation and proof of this misunderstanding, quod sic patet, which is clear in this

 way:

 If, in fact, the epicycle moves regularly with respect to a line to the centre of the

 world, then the arc of the mean motion of the epicycle would always be equal

 to [the arc of the same epicycle] which is situated between the centre of the
 Moon and the line of the mean motion of the centre of the epicycle, or, which

 is the same, the true apogee of the epicycle. But this does not happen. Only

 when the centre of the epicycle is located in the apogee or in the perigee of

 the eccentric are these arcs equal; while when the centre of the epicycle goes

 away from the apogee of the eccentric, moving towards the perigee, the arc of

 85 (Brudzewo 1900: 65): "Secundum Campanum Luna in epicyclo movetur uniformiter et sie [movetur]

 et epicyclus circa centrum suum quod quidem verum est considerando motum epicycli simpliciter in se et

 absolute, sine relatione ad aliquem punctum. Cuilibet enim oibi coelesti motus uniformis convenit ratione
 suae naturae".

 86 The Statement "without reference to any point" excludes any point other than the centre, for the epicycle

 must turn uniformly about its centre.

 87 (Brudzewo 1900: 65): "Cuilibet enim orbi coelesti motus uniformis convenit ratione suae naturae".

 88 (Brudzewo 1900:65): "Quod autem Magister dicit in littera, epicyclum circumvolvi irregulariter, etiam

 verum est in ordine ad aspectum in centra mundi constitutum."

 the Moon's mean motion in the epicycle is always smaller than the arc in the

 epicycle situated between the centre of the Moon and the line of the mean motion

 of the centre of the epicycle, [that is, the true apogee of the epcycle], In the other

 half of the eccentric, it is the opposite, [that is, the arc of the mean motion of the

 Moon in the epicycle is greater than the arc between the centre of the Moon and

 the line of the mean motion of the centre of the epicycle].89

 (d) The epicycle carrying the planet

 To describe the motion of the epicycle which carries the planets, Peurbach states that:

 [The motion of the epicycle carrying each of the planets] is irregular around the

 centre of the epicycle.90

 According to Brudzewo:

 What the Magister [Peurbach] said, that the motion of the epicycle is irregular

 around its centre, must be understood not in an absolute sense and by considering

 the motion of the epicycle by itself, but with respect to the eye (oculum), which

 observes those motions from the centre of the sphere of the signs. For if there

 [in the centre of the world], the irregular motion of the epicycle [is seen to] takes

 place in such a way that when the centre of the epicycle is traveling from the

 apogee of the eccentric to the perigee, the arc of the mean motion of the planet

 in the epicycle is always smaller than the arc of the epicycle contained between

 the true apogee of the epicycle and the centre of the planet, and as much smaller

 as corresponds to the distance between the centre of the sphere of the signs and

 the centre of the equant [i.e. the equation of centre]. While in the other half [of

 the eccentric, the arc of the mean motion] is greater. So in this way it is irregular

 with respect to the centre of the world.91

 Here, the centre of the world becomes the "eye" from which motion happens, or is seen,

 as irregular. Brudzewo has proved successful in identifying the point of observation

 89 (Brudzewo 1900: 65): "Si enim epicyclus moveretur regulariter in ordine ad centrum mundi, extunc
 arcum epicycli medii motus semper staret esse tantum, quantum inter centrum Lunae et inter lineam medii

 motus centri epicycli, seu Augem veram epicycli (quod idem est) compraehenderetur, quod non flt. Dum

 90 (Peurbach [1472]: f. [7r]): "[Motus huius] est super centro epicycli irregularis

 91 (Brudzewo 1900: 93-94): "Quod etiam Magister dicit, illum motum epicycli esse irregulärem super
 centro suo, intelligit non simpliciter et secundum se considerando motum epicycli, sed in ordine ad oculum,

 qui de centro orbis signorum illum spectaret motum; si ibi (L) enim motus epicycli irregularis cadit tali

 modo, quod—centro epicycli discurrente ab auge ecentrici usque ad oppositum—semper minor est arcus

 medii motus planetae in epicyclo, quam arcus epicycli interceptus inter augem veram epicycli et inter

 centrum planetae, et in tantum minor, quantum correspondet distantiae inter centrum orbis signorum et

 inter centrum aequantis. In reliqua vero medietate iterum sit maior: sic ergo fit irregularis in ordine ad

 centrum mundi." The variant "si ibi" appears only in manuscript L; all the other manuscripts and the printed
 editions write "sibi".

 from which Peurbach let himself be led astray, that is, by considering the motion
 of the planet in the epicycle as seen from the centre of the world, from which it is

 irregular. Brudzewo's conclusion is clear "sic ergo fit irregularis in ordine ad centrum

 mundi": that motion becomes irregular with respect to the centre of the world or, more

 accurately, with respect to the eye that observes that motion from that position.

 7 Weaknesses of Peurbach's approach: the astronomers' point of

 observation

 In all the cases we have examined, Brudzewo highlighted the fact that Peurbach must

 have acknowledged that there was irregularity in the world of celestial perfection,

 since he shared the approach adopted by the astronomers, who relate the motions of

 the stars to their observation point, the Earth, which is motionless at the centre of the
 universe. The astronomers, in fact:

 locate the positions of the stars through their visual perception, that is, as if

 both the eyes [of the observer] were standing at the centre of the world looking

 outward at the positions of the stars along lines that can be drawn from the eye

 to the stars: they proceed in this manner and trust to the faculty of their senses.

 [...] They can determine the stars' position with reference to the centre of the

 world precisely because it is always motionless and immutable in relation to all
 the other celestial bodies.92

 This is what the astronomers do: their concern is apparent motions, and the model

 underlying their practice need not correspond to the real universe, but is just an instru
 ment to assist with their calculations.

 Nevertheless, Peurbach cannot permit himself the same freedom allowed to math

 ematical astronomers. According to Brudzewo, Peurbach, besides wishing to account

 for the phenomena and predict the positions of the stars, also wanted to build a universe

 reflecting the true essence of celestial nature with its principles of perfect uniformity

 and circularity of motion. The reading of the Theoricae novae by Brudzewo takes

 these very requirements into consideration and analyses their content in the light of

 these requirements. Perhaps this is the reason why, among all the commentaries on

 the Theoricae, Brudzewo's Commentariolum is the only one containing an analysis

 which grasped the weak points and ambiguities in Peurbach's work. Peurbach, in fact,

 systematically attributed the apparent motion, as seen in the zodiac from the centre

 of the world, directly to the eccentric orb or the epicycle, that is, to orbs, each of

 which actually performs its own motion in relation to its own centre, which is always

 different from the centre of the world. By doing this he deprived those orbs of their

 essential nature, to rotate uniformly in themselves and in an absolute sense. Thus,

 Brudzewo raised a problem that undermined the very foundations of that universe.

 92 (Brudzewo 1900: 34): "Notandum. Matheraatici seu doctrinales determinant de locis astrorum modo

 visuali ac si uterque oculus in centro mundi esset constitutus loca astrorum prospiciens secundum lineas

 ab ipso per astra ducibiles; hoc faciunt iudicio sensus nostri satisfacientes. [...] Determinant etiam de

 locis astrorum in ordine ad centrum mundi, quoniam illud uno et eodem modo se habeat respectu omnium

 corporum coelestium et est immobile."

 393

 Nevertheless, his precise, subtle analysis proved that "the irregularities in the motions

 of the real orbs" stated by Peurbach, if analysed in their more general context, did not

 possess an absolute value, but were derived from considerations of a very particular

 kind, related to the particular point of observation from which Peurbach derived them.

 As we have seen, Brudzewo does not let the apparently coherent structure of the The

 oricae^ universe lead him astray. He remains consistent with his own principles and

 his reading never loses sight of his principal aim: to determine whether Peurbach's

 orbs embody the reality of celestial nature. His analysis identified the multiple incon

 sistencies inherent in those planetary spheres and revealed a problem that could no

 longer be neglected and ignored.

 8 Brudzewo and Copernicus in Cracow

 Brudzewo is aware of the problems raised by his reflections and of the criticism they

 could attract. At the end of his course he expresses his consciousness of the unusual

 character and innovative scope which distinguish his reading of the Theoricae novae.

 He then exhorts the "diligent reader", reflecting on the most profound and essential

 questions pertaining to the study of the stars, to bring forth further improvements by

 taking a new approach (novit er):

 Here ends the Commentariolum on the Theoricae novae of Georg Peurbach

 brought together by Master Albert of Brudzewo for the proper introduction of

 students in the University of Cracow for a reading of the same [Theoricae novae].

 From the unusual remarks expressed in this Commentariolum that have been set

 forth not according to received doctrine and science, the diligent reader should

 not readily rise up in indignation, but let him apply himself to bring forth anew

 what is more certain and profound in furtherance of this science, incited by

 similar effort of these kinds, if he is one who will permit [these things], and not

 receive those which have thus far been childishly brought forth, lest, desiring to

 criticize, he would openly show his own ignorance rather than more properly
 have remained silent.93

 The analysis we have conducted thus far of the Commentariolum allows us to grasp

 the meaning of this passage, with which Brudzewo ended his astronomy courses at

 the Faculty of the Arts at Cracow University in the academic years 1483 and 1488,

 that what he was doing was entirely new and his auditor or readers should not become

 indignant, but should also apply himself to improve this science.

 In 1493 the same Commentariolum was read again in the same Faculty. This time

 it was Simon Sierpc who explained it to his students, and the concluding passage did

 not appear in the manuscripts used to teach the course.94 That Simon Sierpc chose

 93 L: f. 69r; R: 79r; D: 149v; K: 189r. For a Latin transcription see the "Appendix".

 94 (C: f. 154r and f. 169 v). The explicit at f. 169r says that at the end of the year 1493 Michael de Ruszoczjcze

 copied this text which was probably adopted for a course given by one of the Faculty teachers. The student

 says that he finished the copy in "vigilia Circumcisionis domini", the evening of 31 December 1493: he
 could have followed the course in the summer semester of 1493 (cf. "Appendix"). For this semester, the

 Liber diligentiarum says that the Theorica planetarum was taught by Simon Sierpc (Wislocki 1886: 23).

 Μ. Malpangotto

 to adopt the work of his eminent predecessor for his lectures demonstrated that he
 shared the reflections made by Brudzewo which showed the inconsistencies in the

 traditional universe presented in Peurbach's Theoricae novae. Further confirmation

 that those "unusual remarks" aroused interest and were shared by other scholars comes
 from the decision of one of Brudzewo's students, Johannes Otto de Valle Uracense,

 to print two editions in the years 1494 and 1495.95 Indeed, it seems likely that a

 common understanding arose at Cracow University in relation to this text, and a

 shared attitude towards the astronomy of the time. And this happened at the same

 period that Nicolaus Copernicus was a student at that same university.96 Even if one

 excludes the possibility that Copernicus learned astronomy directly from Brudzewo's

 lectures, the young student, immersed in that particularly fertile climate, could have

 been influenced by those reflections and particularly by Brudzewo's singular approach

 to analysing the universe of the Theoricae novae. Indeed, in Copernicus's works we

 can see the same objections brought forth by Brudzewo, the same inconsistencies in

 the name of the same principles.

 9 Copernicus' Commentariolus: a new point of observation

 Copernicus opens his Commentariolus with a reflection about what astronomy had

 already achieved in the past. He examines both the homocentric spheres of Eudoxus and

 Callippus and the tradition of the eccentrics and the epicycles. Both aimed to save the

 apparent motions of the stars through the principle of uniformity, which was considered

 to be essential to the celestial spheres because of their spherical shape, saving the irreg

 ularity of apparent motions through the composition of a number of regular motions.

 Although he shared these a priori assumptions, none of the solutions previously

 proposed succeeded in reaching this objective. Copernicus, in his Commentariolus,
 intended to find "a more reasonable model composed of circles" which would respect

 those axioms in a more rigorous manner and would restore the uniformity of motions:

 I understand that our predecessors assumed a large number of celestial spheres

 principally in order to account for the apparent motion of the planets through

 uniform motion, for it seemed highly unreasonable that a heavenly body should

 not always move uniformly in a perfectly circular figure. They have discovered

 that by the arrangement and combination of uniform motions in different ways

 it could be brought about that any body would appear to move [irregularly] to

 any position.

 Calippus and Eudoxus, attempting to carry this out by means of concentric cir

 cles, could not by the use of these give an account of everything in the planetary

 95 In Μ, the editio princeps of the Commentariolum, Brudzewo's name appears nowhere in the volume, but

 it is worthy to notice that all the extant copies lacks of f. ai, so it is impossible to know what appeared on the

 title page. The second edition (E: f. [a i]) presents a dedication letter of Johannes Otto de Valle Uracense.
 Here Johannes Otto says that he is a student of Brudzewo and expresses his appreciation of his master's

 work: "In Theoricas planetarum Georgii Purbachii viri sane in astronomia disertissimi, interpretationem
 Alberti Prosevi praeceptoris mei [...] Non enim ingrato commentarium hoc iudicatum iri existimo: ubi

 motuum superiorum corporum diversitates reciprocationesque dispares contemplari ceperint."

 to the influence of the aristotelian tradition on "Copernicus' path to heliocentrism".

 395

 motion, that is, not only those motions that appear in connection with the rev

 olutions of the planets, but also that the planets appear to us at times to ascend

 and at times to descend in altitude, which concentric circles in no way permit.

 And for this reason a preferable theory, in which the majority of experts finally

 concurred, seemed to be that it is done by means of eccentrics and epicycles.

 Nevertheless, the theories concerning these matters that have been put forth far

 and wide by Ptolemy and most others, although they correspond numerically

 [with the apparent motions], also seemed quite doubtful, for these theories were

 inadequate unless they also envisioned certain equant circles, on account of

 which it appeared that neither in its deferent sphere nor with respect to its proper

 centre does the planet always move with uniform velocity. Therefore a theory

 of this kind seemed neither perfect enough nor sufficiently in accordance with

 reason.

 97

 This kind of solution persuaded Copernicus to research a new order for the world:

 Therefore, when I noticed these [difficulties], I often pondered whether perhaps

 a more reasonable model composed of circles could be found from which every

 apparent irregularity would follow while every [circle] in itself moved uniformly,

 just as the principle (ratio) of perfect motion required.98

 These words return to the criteria which guided Brudzewo's criticism of Peurbach's

 Theoricae novae: in the name of the principle of the perfect circularity and uniformity

 of motions considered "in se et absolute", it is inadmissible to attribute irregular motion

 to the orbs which actually carry the epicycles and to the epicycles themselves, which

 carry the celestial bodies. But Brudzewo's insistence throughout his Commentariolum

 that certain aspects are a requirement or necessity which must be respected is trans

 formed by Copernicus into the basis on which he will found his search for an alternative

 solution: "a more reasonable model composed of circles [...] from which every appar

 ent irregularity would follow." And the focal point around which the more general

 structure of the new image of the world will be built is the new point of observation.

 In the Theoricae novae this was fixed on the Earth, which was at the centre of

 the universe as required by Aristotelian and Ptolemaic tradition. But Brudzewo had

 demonstrated that Peurbach's equivocal, problematic statements derived in part from

 the position of the observer. In his analysis he had perceived that this particular point

 of observation represented a serious problem for the Theoricae's universe, for the

 motions of spheres that were irregular as seen from the Earth, and that this problem

 had led Peurbach to contradict the principles of celestial nature.

 In the three first postulates of his Commentariolus, Copernicus almost seems to

 share Brudzewo's reflections. He seems to be proposing the solution to the problem:

 he transfers the same point of observation to the fourth sphere, which becomes the

 sphere of the Earth, below the spheres of Saturn, Mars and Jupiter. The Earth is no

 longer the centre of the world, but only the centre of the Moon's sphere; it is no longer

 motionless but, like the other planets, it turns around the Sun which has now become
 the new centre of the world."

 First postulate: There is no one centre of all the celestial orbs or spheres.

 Second postulate: The centre of the Earth is not the centre of the universe, but

 only the centre towards which heavy things move and the centre of the lunar

 sphere.

 Third postulate: All spheres surround the Sun as though it were in the middle of

 all of them, and therefore the centre of the universe is near the Sun.100

 From this new point of observation flow four other postulates showing the conse

 quences of this inversion of perspective. The position of the observer has changed,

 but so have the conditions in which he operates: he is no longer motionless, observing

 the celestial bodies moving in the heavens around him, but is himself in motion as he
 observes the celestial bodies.

 The universe can assume a new physiognomy:

 Fifth postulate: Whatever motion appears in the sphere of the fixed stars belongs

 not to it but to the Earth. Thus the entire Earth along with the nearby elements

 rotates with a daily motion on its fixed poles while the sphere of the fixed stars
 remains immovable [...]

 Sixth postulate: Whatever motions appear to us to belong to the Sun are not due

 to [motion] of the Sun but [to the motion] of the Earth and our sphere with which

 we revolve around the Sun just as any other planet. And thus the Earth is carried

 by more than one motion.

 Seventh postulate: The retrograde and direct motion that appears in the planets

 belongs not to them but to the [motion] of the Earth. Thus, the motion of the Earth

 99 To be correct, one should say around the centre of the Earth's sphere, which is "near the Sun": cf. infra,

 third postulate.

 100 (Swerdlow 1973: 436). Copernicus, Commentariolus, (Prowe 1884: II, 184-202): "Prima petitio:
 Omnium orbium caelestium sive sphaerarum unum centrum non esse. Secunda petitio: Centrum terrae

 non esse centrum mundi, sed tantum gravitatis et orbis Lunaris. Tertia petitio: Omnes orbes ambire Solem,

 tanquam in medio omnium existentem, ideoque circa Solem esse centrum mundi." To these three postulates,
 a fourth one is added concerning the immensity of the Copernican universe when compared to Ptolemy's
 universe.

 by itself accounts for a considerable number of apparently irregular motions in
 the heavens.101

 These postulates, together with the a further postulate stating the immensity of the

 Copernican universe in comparison with the dimensions of the universe described by

 Aristotle and Ptolemy, will, as Copernicus himself declared, allow scholars to consider

 a new universe in which "the uniformity of the motions may be preserved."102 The

 requirement invoked by Brudzewo in his Commentariolum, that the real motions of

 the celestial bodies must be regular, was not entirely new, although it appears that

 he thought of it on his own; yet the image of the world that could have realised that

 principle was still far away.

 10 Copernicus's De revolutionibus

 In books IV and V of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, when Copernicus submits

 the Ancients' theories to his critical analysis, his words echo the same objections found

 in Brudzewo's writing, which Copernicus develops in the name of the same principles,

 showing the same inconsistencies concerning: (a) the motion of the eccentric carrying

 the Moon's epicycle; (b) the motion of the epicycle which carries the lunar body; (c)

 the equant of the planets.

 (a) The motion of the eccentric carrying the Moon's epicycle

 In the first chapter of the fourth book of De revolutionibus, Copernicus set out the

 model that the Ancients had conceived for the Moon and remarked that they "believe

 in fact that with matters so arranged, they correspond to the appearances."103 But in

 the following chapter about The faults in these assumptions he reconsidered the same

 concept:

 Our predecessors indeed assumed such a combination of circles as though agree

 ing with the lunar appearances, but if we consider the reality more carefully, we

 shall find this hypothesis neither suitable enough nor sufficient.104

 101 (Swerdlow 1973: 436). Copernicus, Commentariolus, (Prowe 1884: II, 184-202): "Quinta petitio:
 Quicquid ex motu apparet in firmamento, non esse ex parte ipsius, sed terrae. Terra igitur cum proximis
 elementis motu diurno tota convertitur in polis suis invariabilibus firmamento immobili permanente ac

 ultimo caelo. Sexia petitio: Quicquid nobis ex motibus circa Solem apparet, non esse occasione ipsius, sed

 telluris et nostri orbis, cum quo circa Solem volvimur ceu aliquo alio sidere, sicque terram pluribus motibus

 ferri. Septima petitio: Quod apparet in erraticis retrocessio ac progressus, non esse ex parte ipsarum sed

 telluris. huius igitur solius motus tot apparentibus in caelo diversitatibus sufficit."

 102 (Swerdlow 1973:438). Copernicus, Commentariolus, (Prowe 1884: II, 184-202): "His igitur sic prae

 missis conabor breviter ostendere, quam ordinate aequalitas motuum servari possit." The preservation of

 uniform motion applies also to the Moon.

 103 (Copernicus 1543: f. 99r): "Hisenim sic constitutis congruere putant apparentia." For the purposes of our

 analysis, we prefer a more faithful translation of Copernicus' text, which explicitly refers to "apparences".

 In order to allow the most faithful comparison between Brudzewo's and Copernicus' texts, here and in what

 follows, we have preferred to directly refer to the Latin text of (Copernicus 1543) and directly translate its

 text instead of using the translation in (Rosen 1992).

 104 (Copernicus, 1543, f. 99r): "Talem sane circulorum compositionem tanquam consencientem lunaribus
 apparentiis assumpserunt priores. Verum si rem ipsam diligentius expenderimus non aptam satis nec suffi

 cientem hanc inveniemus hypothesim. Quod ratione et sensu possumus comprobare".

 Μ. Malpangotto

 Copernicus underlined the incoherence hidden within the hypothesis proposed by
 the Ancients regarding the motions of the Moon: uniform motion was attributed to

 appearance, while irregular motion was attributed to reality:

 For when they acknowledge that the motion of the centre of the epicycle is
 uniform about the centre of the Earth, they must also acknowledge that in its
 own eccentric orb, which it describes, it is nonuniform.105

 In order to make this relationship visually clear "Quae ut oculis subiiciantur" he
 inserted a diagram into his text in which the circle ABCD centred in E, the centre

 of the Earth, represents the apparent motion of the epicycle through AB uniformly to

 the east with respect to Ε and the small circle HM represents the epicycle centred
 in G. The circle DG, centred in F, represents the eccentric deferent, which moves
 around the Earth through AD uniformly to the west so that its centre F describes a

 "small circle" around Ε.106 The result is that the motion of the centre of the epicycle
 through DAB is twice its motion in the circle around the Earth, that is, DAB = 2 AB,
 and while the motion through DAB is uniform, the motion on the eccentric DG is
 nonuniform.

 By referring to the diagram, Copernicus explains the situation of the motions as con
 ceived by the Ancients:

 105 (Copernicus 1543: f. 99r): "Dum enim fatentur, motum centri epicycli aequalem esse circa centrum
 terrae, fateri etiam oportet inaequalem esse in orbe proprio, quem describit, eccentro".

 106 Peurbach also refers to the path of the centre of the deferent as a "small circle", and in his text it is the

 result of the movements of the two orbs eccentric in a certain sense, which shift the deferent orb, causing
 its centre to draw a small circle, see supra, note 44.

 399

 Since if, for example, angle AEB is assumed to be 45 degrees, that is, half a right

 angle, and equal to AED, so that the entire BED is a right angle, and the centre

 of the epicycle is taken to be in G and GF be joined, it is obvious that exterior

 angle GFD is greater than interior and opposite angle GEF. Therefore arcs DAB
 and DG, both described in the same time, are unequal, so that when DAB is a

 quadrant, DG, which meanwhile the centre of the epicycle describes, is greater

 than a quadrant of a circle. It was, however, shown that at half-Moon both DAB
 and DG were a semicircle, therefore the motion of the epicycle that it describes
 in its eccentric is nonuniform.107

 It is now that the contradiction inherent in the hypothesis of the lunar motions becomes

 evident. Copernicus continues his analysis:

 But if this were so, what shall we reply with regard to the axiom, that the motion

 of the heavenly bodies is uniform and only with regard to appearance does it

 appear nonuniform, if the apparent uniform motion of the epicycle is in reality

 nonuniform, and there take place completely the opposite of the established and

 assumed principle?108

 But his analysis does not stop with this contradiction; he goes into the problem even

 more deeply, employing increasing subtlety. So he adds:

 But if you were to say that the epicycle moves uniformly about the centre of

 the Earth, and that this is sufficient to maintain uniformity, of what sort will that

 uniformity be, in a foreign circle in which the motion of the epicycle does not

 occur, although it does occur in its eccentric?109

 Brudzewo had used the same critical terms when discussing precisely the same con

 tradictions presented in De revolutionibus.n0

 107 (Copernicus 1543: 99r-99v): "Quoniam si, verbi gratia, AEB angulus sumatur partium XLV, hoc est

 dimidius recti, et aequalis ipsi AED, ut totus BED rectus fiat, capiaturque centrumepicycli in G et connectatur

 GF, manifestum est, quod angulus GFD maior est ipsi GEF, exterior interiori et opposito. Quapropter et
 circumferentiae DAB, et DG dissimiles sub uno tempore ambae descriptae, ut cum DAB quadrans fuerit,

 DG quem interim centrum epicycli descripsit, maior sit quadrante circuli. Patuit autem in Luna dividua
 utramque DAB et DG semicirculum fuisse, inaequalis est ergo epicycli motus in eccentro suo quem ipse
 describit."

 108 (Copernicus, 1543, f. 99v): "Quod si sic fuerit, quid respondebimus ad axioma, Motum caelestium
 corporum aequalem esse, et nisi ad apparentiam inaequalem videri, si motus epicycli aequalis apparens,

 fuerit reipsa inaequalis? accideturque constitute principio et assumpto penitus contrarium".

 109 (Copernicus, 1543, f. 99v): "At si dicas aequaliter ipsum [epicyclum] moveri circa tenae centrum, atque

 id esse satis ad aequalitatem tuendam, qualis igitur erit ilia aequalitas in circulo alieno, in quo motus eius
 non existit, sed in suo eccentro?".

 110 See supra 6—The irregular motions in Peurbach's universe: a—The eccentric carrying the epicycle of

 the Moon: Brudzewo's commentary on first corollary of Peurbach. About the same corollary Birkenmajer,

 in (Brudzewo 1900: 55), had already noticed that: "Correlarium hoc, nec non altera de eadem 'maxima'

 philosophica Brudzevii disceptatio [cf. p. 85], maximi sunt momenti in inquirendis exordio primoque con

 Μ. Malpangotto

 (b) The motion of the epicycle carrying the lunar body

 The "defect" that Copernicus detects for the Moon in its eccentric also extends to the

 motion that his predecessors attributed to it in its epicycle:

 Likewise, we also wonder at this, that they also intend the uniformity of the

 Moon in its epicycle to be understood, not in relation to the centre of the Earth

 through the line, namely EGM, to which with good reason the uniformity ought

 to be referred, in accordance with [the motion of] the centre of the epicycle, but

 with respect to a certain different point—and in addition that the Earth is midway

 between that point and the centre of the eccentric—and that the line IGH is as

 though the index of the uniformity [of the motion] of the Moon in the epicycle,

 which also sufficiently shows that this motion is in fact nonuniform.111

 The "certain different point" with the Earth halfway between it and the centre of

 the eccentric is the point I diametrically opposite to the centre of the eccentric F,

 and the line IGH is the "index of the uniformity [of the motion] of the Moon in

 the epicycle", from the mean apogee H, which Brudzewo in his Commentariolum

 describes as having an inclinatio et reflexio, a turning forward and turning back motion.

 Copernicus' criticism of the mean apogee is the same as that made by Brudzewo who,

 in his Commentariolum emphasised the same question: the uniformity of the motion

 of the Moon with reference to an abstract point.

 (c) The equant of the planets

 In book V of De revolutionibus, in the chapter devoted to The planets' uniform and

 apparent motion, as explained by the theory of the Ancients, Copernicus analyses the

 incoherence of the planetary models at some length. In Copernicus' work one find

 the same criticism that Brudzewo had made in the name of the uniformity of motion,

 regarding the equant circle, and in the same terms.112

 As we have already noticed, Brudzewo shows the paradoxical situation created in

 the Theoricae's planetary spheres, where the eccentric orb carrying the epicycle actu

 ally turns around its own centre, but in an irregular way, while the regularity of its

 motion is referred to another point, that is, to the centre of the "circulus imaginatus"

 which is the equant circle. And though adopting the equant satisfied Peurbach, since

 111 (Copernicus, 1543, f. 99v): "Ita sane miramur et illud, quod ipsius Lunae quoque in epicyclo aequal
 itatem volunt intelligi non comparatione centri terrae per lineam, videlicet EGM, ad quam merito debebat

 referri aequalitas, ipso centra epicycli consentiens, sed ad punctum quoddam diversum, atque inter ipsum
 et eccentri centrum mediam esse terram, et lineam IGH tanquam indicem aequalitatis Lunae in epicyclo

 quod etiam re ipsa inaequalem satis demonstrate hunc motum."

 112 The commentaries on the Theoricae novae which we have already studied, in both manuscript and

 printed form, do not formulate any criticism of the equant similar to the one expressed by Brudzewo
 and Copernicus. Brudzewo and Copernicus concentrate on the fact that the epicycle moves on one circle

 and the uniformity of its motion is evaluated with reference to another circle. All the other authors, from

 Regiomontanus onward at least until Reinhold, justify this by the fact that by following a mathematical
 approach only one point of a circumference can move regularly in relation to a point which is not the

 geometrical centre of the circumference. Cf. (Regiomontanus [1475]: f. 4v) and (Reinhold 1542: ff. sign.
 Nv v-[Nvi] r).

 401

 he found regularity of motion in a purely mathematical "rule", Brudzewo's criticism of

 the equant goes beyond simply denouncing it as a mathematical instrument: his denun

 ciation assumes much greater significance for him because by adopting the equant, the

 Viennese Magister violated the essence of celestial nature with its principle of unifor

 mity, according to which the celestial bodies must move uniformly around the centre
 of their motion.113 In his Commentariolus Copernicus had already addressed the same

 criticisms of the equant. In the fifth book of De revolutionibus, Copernicus explains

 the Ancients' theory in order to criticise the models they had conceived for the planets:

 The ancient mathematicians, who held the Earth immobile, imagined for Saturn,

 Jupiter, Mars, and Venus eccentrics with epicycles, and in addition, another

 eccentric, with respect to which the epicycle, and also the planet in the epicycle,

 moved uniformly.114

 these new relationships:

 Once again Copernicus uses a geometrical diagram for this analysis in order to visualise

 For example, if there be eccentric circle AB, the centre of which is C, and the
 diameter ACB, in which the centre of the Earth is D, so that the apogee is in

 A and the perigee in B\ and DC be divided into two parts at E, from which

 centre [E] there be described another eccentric FG equal to the previous [eccen

 tric AB]·, in which [FG], taking in any way centre Η, there be drawn epicycle

 IK; and there be drawn through centre [H] straight line IHKC, and likewise

 LHME. [...] the epicycle also [moves] from west to east in consequentia in cir

 cle FHG, but [uniformly] with IHC, the line with respect to which the star also

 revolves uniformly in its epicycle. It is, however, certain that the uniformity [of

 the motion] of the epicycle ought to take place with respect to Ε, the centre of its

 deferent, and the revolution of the planet with respect to line LME. They allow,

 therefore, that the uniformity of this circular motion can also take place about a

 foreign, and not its own, centre. Likewise also in the case of Mercury this takes

 place even more so. But this has already been sufficiently refuted concerning the
 Moon.115

 113 About this point Birkenmajer, in (Brudzewo 1900: 85), had already noticed the relation to Copernicus:
 "Argumentum disceptationis proxime sequentis ("Hoc enim esset contra illam maximam", etc.) connex
 ionem habet intimam cum correlario pag. 55 lin. 4 seq. excuso. Utriusque loci, summam in disquisitionibus

 circa primitias doctrinae Copernicanae gravitatem habentis, ibidem obiter meminimus."

 114 (Copernicus, 1543, f. 140v): "Prisci Mathematici, qui immobilem tenebant terrain, imaginati sunt in

 Saturno, love, Marte, et Venere eccentrepicyclos, et praeterea alium eccentrum ad quem epicyclus aequaliter

 moveretur, ac planeta in epicyclo."

 115 (Copernicus, 1543, f. 140v): "Quemadmodum si fuerit eccentrus AB circulus, cuius centrum sit C,

 dimetiens autem ACB, in quo centra terrae D, ut sit apogaeum in A, perigaeum in B, secta quoque DC

 bifariam in E, quo facto centre describatur alter eccentros priori aequalis FG, in quo suscepto utcunque

 Η centre, designetur epicyclus IK, et agatur per centrum eius recta linea IHKC, similiter et LHME. [...]

 epicyclum quoque in consequentia in FHG circulo, sed penes IHC, lineam ad quam etiam Stella revolvatur

 aequaliter in ipso IK epicyclo. Constat autem quod aequalitas epicycli fieri debuit ad Ε centrum sui dif

 ferentis, et planetae revolutio ad LME lineam. Concedunt igitur et hie motus circularis aequalitatem fieri
 posse circa centrum alienum et non proprium. Similiter etiam in Mercurio hoc magis accidere. Sed iam
 circa Lunam id sufficienter refutatum est."

 Copernicus, De Revolutionibus, 1543, f. 140v

 The results of this analysis, which encompassed the essential points of astronomy

 according to the ancient tradition, persuaded Copernicus to displace the point of obser
 vation, that is the Earth, and find a more effective solution which took into account both

 the uniformity of the celestial bodies' actual motions and the irregularity of apparent
 motions:

 These and similar questions provided the inducement for considering the mobil

 ity of the Earth and other ways by which the uniformity [of motions] and the
 principles of the science would be preserved and the account of the apparent
 nonuniformity be rendered more certain.116

 11 Concluding remarks

 The need to see celestial nature realised according to authentic and rigorous principles

 led scholars to submit the universe to a refined analysis. Once the geometrical models
 of the Almagest have to be realised in the corporeal orbs of the Theoricae novae,
 their accuracy can no longer simply be proved purely by mathematical rigour. If those
 circles become physical orbs which form integral parts of the real spheres, these new

 models must be evaluated on the basis of how they accord with the principles of the

 celestial reality of which they are a part. According to this interpretation, the universe

 that Peurbach believed could succeed in reconciling astronomy and physics by offering

 116 (Copernicus 1543: f. 140v): "Haec et similia nobis occasionem praestiterunt de mobilitate terrae,
 aliisque modis cogitandi, quibus aequalitas et principia artis permanerent, et ratio inaequalitatis apparentis
 reddatur constantior."

 403

 the "realem sperarum habitudinem atque motum", the real shape of the spheres and

 motions, can no longer be reconciled with that same celestial nature of which it forms

 a part, and instead becomes the object of criticism.

 This was the attitude adopted by the Cracovian tradition,117 started by Albert of

 Brudzewo. It analyses this universe and acknowledges the merits for which it has

 broadly been appreciated, but imposes the requirement that all the principles of celestial
 nature must to be realised in the universe, and first and foremost, the perfect circularity

 and uniformity of the motions. In the name of celestial perfection, Brudzewo grasped
 the weak elements and inconsistencies in Peurbach's universe, focused on the limits

 of the astronomers, namely, to save appearances, and came to doubt the correctness of

 the place of the observer in the centre of the world as the location from which uniform

 and nonuniform motions are distinguished. For Copernicus, the perfect regularity and

 circularity of motions upon which Brudzewo had insisted as a necessity became the

 basis upon which he founded his search for an alternative solution: "to find a more
 reasonable model composed of circles [...] from which every apparent irregularity

 would follow while every [circle] in itself moved uniformly, just as the principle

 (ratio) of perfect motion required." Brudzewo's most famous "follower", as we may
 now call him, thus proved that it was not just possible, but actually necessary, to

 formulate astronomy based upon this new principle.

 We hope that this analysis has contributed a small tile to help reconstruct the great

 mosaic that forms the Copernican theory. The problems on which Brudzewo focused

 were of contemporary concern, and from Brudzewo's Commentariolum Copernicus
 could find the reasons for undertaking his search for an alternative solution. How he

 confronted the different approaches and various theories, the way in which he dealt

 with the problems which emerged as the construction of his universe became more
 and more technical and refined, and the manner in which he always found a solution

 to these problems—these are all very different questions.118

 Acknowledgments I would like to warmly thank Noel Swerdlow for his advice.

 Appendix: List of manuscripts and printed editions of Brudzewo's
 Commentariolum

 We present here the extant copies of Brudzewo's Commentariolum which enrich the

 corpus described by Birkanmajer in (Brudzewo 1900), made up of L, C, E, of some

 manuscripts, we have called R, D and K, and of the editio princeps M.

 117 We refer to a "tradition" in the sense documented by the sources attesting that some teachers and

 students spread Brudzewo's Commentariolum. See supra 8- Brudzewo and Copernicus in Cracow, and also

 Appendix.

 118 For these questions one can refer to (Neugebauer and Swerdlow 1984) which remains the authoritative

 reference, providing the most technically founded answers that the history of science has been able to

 formulate until now, and to (Szczeciniarz 1998) which opens a subtle reflection involving astronomical,

 mathematical, philosophical and epistemological aspects intended to make the extant studies converse with

 a refined analysis of Copernicus' text.

 The explicit of L confirms that Brudzewo's teaching dates back to the year 1483:
 "Dictum est anno domini Millesimo quadringentesimo octogesimo tertio." The Liber

 diligentiarum of the Arts Faculty (Wisiocki 1886) starts with year 1487, so does not

 contain the teachers for the previous period. According to Birkenmajer, (Brudzewo

 1900: XXVII), the manuscript annotation "1483 Brudzew legit" in the margin of f.

 sign. a3v of the 1495 printed version, Inc. 2705 of the Jagiellonian Library, confirms
 that in 1483 Brudzewo read his Commentariolum.119

 The same explicit in L also says that the text of the Commentariolum was made pub

 lic to students in 1488: "Scriptum vero et in publicum editum anno domini Millesimo

 quadringentesimo octogesimo octavo". The Liber diligentiarum of the Arts Faculty

 of Cracow (Wisiocki 1886, 5) shows that Brudzewo gave a course on the Theorica

 planetarum in 1488. So he taught the commentary copied in manuscripts L, R, D, K.

 The manuscripts, R, D, K, contain only the first part of the explicit in L, and

 refer solely to the 1483 course, without stating who copied the work or when. The

 explicit of Peurbach's Theoricae novae in manuscript R confirms that this text was

 also copied in 1488. And since the Commentariolum does not present those passages

 of the Theoricae novae under consideration in their entirety, but only mentions the

 initial words of each passage, the integral copies of Peurbach's work associated with

 Brudzewo's work in these exemplars would have been read at the same time, so that

 the teacher's progressive commentary would support the students' reading of the text.

 In D no other date appears, but in this manuscript (ff. 150r-150v), as in R (ff. 79

 r-79 v), the Commentariolum is followed by two identical small texts that seem to

 be two copies of a common source. So probably both these copies, D and R, date to
 1488, as stated at the end of the Theoricae novae in R.

 Manuscript C confirms that the Commentariolum was still read at Cracow Univer

 sity in the 1490's. The explicit at f. 169r of C says in fact that, at the end of the year

 1493, Michael de Ruszoczjcze copied this text and he finished the copy in "vigilia
 Circumcisionis domini", the evening of 31 December 1493; he could have followed

 the course in the summer semester of 1493. For this semester, the Liber diligentiarum

 of the Arts Faculty of Cracow (Wisiocki 1886, 23) says that the Theorica planetarum

 was taught by Simon Sierpc.

 In all the extant copies of the editio princeps Μ of the Commentariolum, Brudzewo's

 name appears nowhere in the volumes, but it is worthy to note that all the extant copies

 lack f. a i, probably the title page, so it is impossible to know what appeared on it.

 The second edition Ε presents at f. [a i]r a dedication letter of Johannes Otto de Valle

 Uracense. Here Johannes Otto says that he is a student of Brudzewo and expresses his

 appreciation of his master's work: "In Theoricas planetarum Georgii Purbachii viri

 sane in astronomia disertissimi, interpretationem Alberti Prosevi praeceptoris mei [... ]

 Non enim ingrato commentarium hoc iudicatum iri existimo: ubi motuum superiorum

 corporum diversitates reciprocationesque dispares contemplari ceperint."

 119 The authority of the marginal notes in this copy comes, not only from the fact that the writing is of that

 epoch, but especially from the fact that the person who annotated this printed copy systematically amends

 the variants of the printed text, integrating the manuscript version of L or of another copy transmitting the

 first course of Brudzewo in 1483. What is also interesting is that these same variants are common to Μ and

 E, so this person had to go back to a manuscript version.
