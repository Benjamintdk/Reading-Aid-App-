 1 Introduction

 In the history of astronomy, theory and observation have not always moved forward

 hand-in-hand in many fields, as each may have been involved in its own problems. The

 history of prediction and observation of annular solar eclipse is one such example.1
 The annular solar eclipse occurs when the angular diameter of the moon is less than

 that of the sun. In such a case, if the angular distance between the center of the moon's

 apparent disk and that of the sun is very close, at mid-eclipse (or near to it) a part of
 the solar disc appears as a ring of light around the dark disc of the moon. This kind of

 solar eclipse occurs when the sun is at perigee and the moon is at apogee.2

 The variation in the apparent diameters of the sun and moon had no role in

 Babylonian astronomy. But the Greek astronomers tried to consistently relate appar-
 ent diameters of the sun and moon with their corresponding distances from the earth
 based on geometrical and observational proofs. Indeed, their achievements based on

 1 It is important to know that the problem of annular solar eclipse was still being debated in seventeenth
 century Europe. See Stephenson (1997, p. 467).

 2 Annular solar eclipse may even not exactly fulfill the mentioned conditions.

 geometrical methods led to unsatisfactory results.3 Ptolemy made observations by an

 instrument, called Dioptra , to obtain the exact values of the sun's apparent diameter.4
 Ptolemy compared the magnitude of two lunar eclipses and the moon's latitude to
 measure the moon's angular diameter. Ptolemy concluded that the apparent diameter
 of the sun is constant and must be the same as that of the moon at apogee.5 This
 fault probably originated from his imprecise observational instrument and the intense

 light of the sun causing a serious problem in precisely measuring the sun's apparent

 diameter through direct observation. Ptolemy considered that the apparent diameter
 of the moon varies between 0;35,20° (at perigee) and 0;31,20° (at apogee).6

 This determination led to his failure to predict the possibility of annular solar

 eclipse.7 For ancient astronomers, observing a solar eclipse was the only way to
 examine the actual differences between the apparent diameters of the sun and moon

 in certitude. The variation in the apparent diameters of the moon and sun has a notice-
 able effect on the greatest value of the solar eclipse magnitude and duration. In the

 Almagest , Ptolemy shows the effect of the lunar distance from the earth in predicting
 solar eclipses. In his Table for solar eclipse, (VI 8), there are two separate lists of

 arguments of latitude. The argument of latitude indicates the ecliptic distance of the

 moon from the highest northern point of the moon's circle around the earth (for the

 3 We know that in Ptolemaic model, the relation between the moon's distance and its angular diameter was
 inconsistent, because as the moon keeps distance two times at apogee (compared to perigee), its angular
 diameter just drops about 11%, instead of becoming half. Therefore, it seems that Ptolemy neglected the
 consistency in variation of angular diameter of the moon in his lunar model. For the sun, Ptolemy's solar
 model permits one to suppose variation in the sun's apparent diameter, but Ptolemy has not considered it.
 See also Pedersen (1974, pp. 198-199).

 4 It seems that Hipparchus originally invented Dioptra , See Toomer (1998, p. 252).

 5 Ibid, pp. 252-254.

 ® Ibid, pp. 283-284. For the moon, the modern value lies between 0;29,22° and 0;33,3 1 ° and for the sun
 it lies between 0;31,28° and 0;32,32°.

 7 See Pedersen (1974, p. 208). Neugebauer (1975, vol. 1, pp. 1 10-1 1 1) has proved that indeed Ptolemy's
 theory for solar distance basically permits one to conclude annular solar eclipse. Thus, it is unclear why
 Ptolemy neglected the variation of sun's distance in computation of its angular diameter. However, the
 problem of annular solar eclipse was a controversial issue in Greek astronomy. Apparently, Polemarchus
 (d. 404 B.C.), a younger contemporary of Eudoxus, did see an annular eclipse and this experience may
 have resulted in the statement found in the "Eudoxus Papyrus" that total solar eclipses are impossible. It
 seems that Hipparchus (190-120 B.C.), in his treatise on solar and lunar distances, probably was aware of
 this that sometimes angular diameter of the moon is less than that of the sun. However, this is concluded

 indirectly from the values given for the relative sizes of the sun and moon to the earth (see Swerdlow 1969,
 pp. 287-305; Ragep 1993, vol. 2, p. 461). Another annular eclipse (probably 164 A.D., Sept 4) was observed
 by Sosigenes. Cleomedes (sometime between mid-1 st century B.C. and 400 A.D.) simply denies the reality
 of annular eclipses in contrast to the opinion of "some older" astronomers. Proclus (412-485 A.D.) also
 says that "some astronomers" report this type of eclipses, but he notes that Ptolemy's parameters exclude
 annular eclipses (for the references of these reports see Neugebauer (1975, vol. 2, p. 668)). Moreover,
 Simplicus in his commentary on Aristotle's De caelo , in 530 A.D. explains the possibility of annular solar
 eclipse. Although Bowen (2008, p. 74, see note 301) casts doubt on this subject, I see no problem to accept
 Simplicus' statement as evidence on annular eclipse (see also Heath 1991, pp. 69, 188; Pedersen 1974,
 ibid.). The main problem is that we have no information whether this statement stems from Aristotle's
 original work or it was simply added by Simplicus. On the other hand, based on the available evidence (see

 below) it is very unlikely that the notion of annular solar eclipse has been transferred from Greek to Islamic

 astronomy.

 digits of solar eclipse (adopted

 from Toomer 1998, p. 303)

 limits of arguments of latitude, see Table 2). 8 The arguments of latitude correspond to

 the values of the greatest solar eclipse obscurity (in digits), for the two cases in which

 the moon is at apogee and at perigee. The Greek astronomers measured obscurity (or
 magnitude) of a solar eclipse by a unit that is called digit. The solar disc is divided
 into 12 digits.9 In Fig. 1, E and O indicate centers of the apparent discs of the sun
 and moon respectively and the ratio ( DZ/DB ). 12 gives the value of solar eclipse
 magnitude in digits. For the case that the solar eclipse is total, the value of digits at

 mid-eclipse is obtained by: (ZH/D B). 12. 10

 In Islamic zTjes (astronomical handbooks with tables), the greatest value of solar

 eclipse digits is normally given corresponding to mid-eclipse distance from the ascend-

 ing or descending node and not from the highest northern point as Ptolemy considered
 (see the arc QM in Fig. 2). Sometimes digits are given corresponding to the moon's
 ecliptic latitude. The argument of latitude and the moon's ecliptic latitude can be
 computed from each other (see below).

 8 See Pedersen (1974, p. 201); Toomer (1998, p. 306).

 9 In Plutarch, one finds the remark that the diameter of the moon at mean distance is 12 digits. This makes

 only sense if taken as a definition which then must be implemented by the grading of instruments: one digit
 is the twelfth of the apparent diameter of the moon when at mean distance. This is in conformity with a

 statement by Sosigenes ( 1 75 A.D.) that a disk sometimes of 1 1 , sometimes of 1 2 digits in diameter is needed
 to cover the moon. It is perhaps one of Ptolemy's clever innovations to define "digits" always as twelfths of
 the apparent diameter of sun or moon, regardless of the eccentricity (see Neugebauer 1975, vol. 2, p. 658).

 The value of digits should be modified by using an auxiliary table ( Almagest , VI 8,

 Table 3), based on the given lunar anomaly when the moon lies between apogee and

 perigee.1 1 The greatest value of digits in Ptolemaic model is 12d at apogee and 12;48d

 at perigee. This indicates that angular diameter of the moon will never be less than
 that of the sun,12 thus this is consistent with the above-mentioned Ptolemaic values

 for the angular diameters.

 The Ptolemaic theory for solar eclipse was re-examined by later astronomers from

 the Islamic period, particularly the part that concerns the apparent diameters of the sun
 and moon. Islamic astronomers achieved new values of apparent diameters based on

 solar eclipse or non-eclipse observations.13 Moreover, they learned about the values
 of solar and lunar angular diameters that were transmitted from the Indian to Islamic
 astronomy (see below).

 The earliest reliable record of an annular eclipse goes back to Abu'l c Abbas

 al-Iranshahrl. According to al-BIrunfs explicit citation, al-Iranshahrl had observed
 the annularity phase of a solar eclipse in 259 A.H./873 A.D. at Neishabour (in his-
 torical texts: Nishapur/Nisabur, a city in north-east of Iran).14 The validity of this

 observation has been proved by modern research.15 For post-Iranshahri observations,

 in history of Islamic astronomy, there is just another known observation made by
 al-WabkanwI.16 However, this observation still awaits an independent and profound

 analysis.17

 1 1 For a numerical example of this computation, see ibid, pp. 656-657.

 12 Ibid, p. 306.

 13 For a brief research on various values of the apparent diameters of the sun and moon in astronomy of
 the Islamic period, see Ragep (1993, vol. 2, p. 460).

 14 Al-BTrunT (1954-1956, vol. 2, p. 632).

 15 This solar eclipse occurred on 28 July 873. See Goldstein (1985, pp. 101-102); Stephenson (1997,
 p. 467).

 16 See al-Muhaqqaq al-Sultanl Zlj, ms. 'Ulumi Library (no. 68) in Yazd, Chapter {maqala) 3, Book (bab)
 14: knowing solar eclipse based on tables (fols.l30r-134v). For al-WabkanwT's biography and works, see
 Rosenfeld and Ihsanoglu (2003, pp. 245-246).

 17 Indeed M. Muzaffari firstly introduced al-WabkanwT's observation of an annular eclipse (occurred on
 29 Shawwal 681 A.H./January 30, 1283 A.D.) in the following note: "WabkanawT and the first scientific
 observation of an annular eclipse", The Observatory: A Review of Astronomy, June 2009, pp. 144-146.
 However he has cited some parameters of this eclipse erroneously, because of reading or recognizing them

 carelessly from the manuscript. For instance, for this annular eclipse he cites the value of the angular diam-

 eter of the moon, greater than that of the sun, based on what has extracted of al-WabkanwT's record! By

 referring to the zij , one can find the correct mentioned values of the angular diameters of the sun and the
 moon as: 0; 32,59° and 0; 32,11° respectively (see also al-Muhaqqaq al-SultanT ZTj, ms. Ayasofya, no.
 2694, fol.74v).
 There are several other mistakes and deficiencies in his method of research and in the given values and

 computations. However, it is very important that this observation be analyzed correctly and precisely in
 future. It is noteworthy to say that al-WabkanwT claims that he had computed the parameters of this eclipse
 in advance and he knew there would be annularity phase in it, and then he observed it in the Mughan

 plain (northwest of Iran). Fortunately, al-WabkanwT has given us the algorithm of computation in details;
 therefore it is one of the rare cases in the Islamic astronomy, in which the author provides us with the whole

 numerical computation of a real solar eclipse.

 Al-KhwarizmT and annular solar eclipse 503

 Since no observational record of this phenomenon prior to IranshahrT exist and,

 as a whole, because of its scarcity in the history of astronomy,18 sometimes we are

 encouraged to study the problem indirectly in historical sources.

 The method of such study is based on two key points which indicate the authors'

 presumptive information on this phenomenon. The first and more reliable one is to
 examine the values of digits given in solar eclipse tables. If the magnitude of solar

 eclipse in such tables is less than 12 (given in digit, for the case that the moon has no

 ecliptic latitude at mid eclipse), it would imply the authors' possible awareness of the
 annular eclipse.

 The second point concerns the mathematical formulae that relate angular diame-

 ters of the sun and moon with their angular velocities per hour or day. Such formulae

 originated from Indian astronomy and were apparently transferred to the astronomy of

 the Islamic period through al-Khwarizmi's Zij .19 In some Islamic zTje s the computed
 results based on such formulae are shown in tabular forms.20 If the value of the moon's

 angular diameter is less than that of the sun in certain limits, one may conclude the

 possibility of the author's awareness of annular eclipse. However, this cannot be strong

 evidence by itself, and if both evidences mentioned above, appear in an astronomical

 work together, they can lead us to a more conclusive judgment.

 The aim of this article is to examine the materials presented in the al-Khwarizmi's

 Zij with regard to the two above-mentioned techniques, considering potentially exist-

 ing information on annular solar eclipse in early period of Islamic astronomy.

 1.1 Annular solar eclipse: historical intricacies

 A statistical study shows that about 33% of different kinds of solar eclipses are annular.
 Among numerous historical records of solar eclipses available to us, only a few are
 annular.

 The scarcity of observational records of annular solar eclipses in historical texts
 may be justified based on several reasons. We know that annular solar eclipses are
 slightly more frequent than total ones, while both total and annular eclipses are less
 frequent than partial ones. Those observers lying at the central path of an annular
 eclipse can distinguish it as a brilliant ring and those who observe it out of the central

 path; it makes no difference with a normal partial solar eclipse, because its appearance

 changes to an open ring. For ancient astronomers it was a real task to compute actual
 course of the central path, because an error equal to one digit in computations could
 erroneously displace the zone of the central path 500 km far away from the accurate

 place.21 Of course, the width of the central path may reach to 300 km or more in some
 annular eclipses.

 18 For the authentic historical records, describing the annularity phase of solar eclipses, see Stephenson
 (1997, pp. 62-63, 258, 394, 404, 41 1, 467).

 19 See Neugebauer (1962, pp. 57-59).

 20 See Suter (1997, pp. 175-180) (Tables 61-66). For the recomputed values of these tables with 6° inter-
 val, see Table 1; for another historical table, see Kushyar ibn Labban, al-Jamic Zij, ms. Fatih, no. 3418/1,
 fol. 86r. For its analysis and the formulae behind it, see Giahi Yazdi (2009, pp. 152-155).

 Although, a close ring of annular eclipse may be spotted by keen observers, but it

 is clearly seen with naked eye, where it occurs particularly near to the local horizon

 because of the solar light intensity.22 On the other hand, the annularity phase is not a

 long-lasting phenomenon and it takes normally less than 12 minutes.23

 From statistical point of view, ancient astronomers had little chance to face an annu-

 lar solar eclipse and say precisely, observing the annularity phase. From astronomical

 point of view, this problem is comparable with the scarcity of observational records

 of totality phase in historical texts.24 However, the appearance of an annular eclipse
 would not be as splendid as a total one.

 1.2 Al-Khwarizml and his ZTj: historical background

 Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizml was an eminent astronomer and mathematician

 at the court of al-Ma'mun (Abbasid Caliph) in the ninth century.25 He compiled a
 zTj around 230 A.H./844 A.D., which is considered as his most significant astro-

 nomical work. It was frequently referred to by later astronomers. The importance of

 al-KhwarizmT's ZTj is in that, besides the Mumtahan ZTj , it remained somehow incorpo-

 rated from the early period of Islamic astronomy. Al-KhwarizmT's ZTj includes numer-

 ous methods from the Indian, Greek and Iranian pre-Islamic astronomy.26 According
 to the historical sources, there were two editions of al-KhwarizmT's ZTj , but we know

 nothing of the differences between them.27 Today, there is only a Latin version of the

 zTj available that had been translated by Adelard Bathi in the early twelfth century.28 It

 was not translated directly from its original Arabic text, rather a recension of Andalu-

 sian astronomer al-Majrltl (d. 1007-1008)29 and perhaps further revised by al-Majntl's
 pupil, Ibn al-Saffar (d. 1035).30 We can, however, get some notions of the original
 form of the work from extracts and commentaries made by earlier writers. Thus, from

 the tenth century comments of Ibn al-Muthanna, we learn that al-Khwarizml formu-
 lated his table of sines on a base of 150 (a common Indian parameter), whereas base
 60 (usually in Islamic sine tables) was employed in extant tables.31 From the same
 source, we learn that the epoch of the original tables was Yazdgerd era, established

 22 It is noteworthy to say that the annularity phase of the solar eclipse of 873 (which was observed by
 al-Iranshahri) occurred in early morning (see Stephenson 1997, p. 467). See Footnote 15.

 23 See Meeus (2002, pp. 1 16-1 17).

 24 According to Stephensons' survey, there is no record of total solar eclipse in Islamic zTjes (see Stephen-
 son 1997, pp. 456-500). For a comprehensive analysis of the solar eclipse observations rested in Islamic
 zljz s, see Said and Stephenson (1996, pp. 259-273, 1997, pp. 29^48).

 biography ( DSB ), vol. 7, pp. 358-365; Rosenfeld and Ihsanoglu (2003, pp. 23-25).

 by the last Sassanid King Yazdgerd-e III (epoch: 16 June 632) and not the lunar Hijra
 era (epoch: 15 July 622) which appears in al-Majrltl's revision.32 There is another

 commentary of al-Khwarizmi's Zij written by Ibn Masrur that has not been edited and

 published yet.33

 In fact, the survived version of al-Khwarizmi's Zij consists of a variety of different

 astronomical methods that were derived from Indian, Greek and Iranian pre-Islamic

 astronomy. However, it is mostly based on Indian astronomy.

 The Zij of al-Khwarizml, was the first of such work to reach the west. Many of

 al-Khwarizmi's tables reached a wide audience in the west via another work, the

 Toledan Tables , a miscellaneous assembly of astronomical tables from the work of
 al-Khwarizml, al-Battanl, and al-Zarqall which was translated into Latin, probably by

 Gerard of Cermona, in the late twelfth century.34

 1.3 Annular solar eclipse: supporting evidence in the al-Khwarizmi's Zlj

 1.3.1 Tables of lunar and solar angular velocities and apparent diameters

 Tables 61-66 in the al-Khwarizmi's Zij show angular velocity of the sun and moon per
 hour, corresponding to their apparent or angular diameters. According to the values
 in the Tables 61-66, col. 2-5, Prof. Neugebauer presented the following relations35:

 rfs/(v°/h) = 13; 12 and dm/{v°Jh) = 0;58, i0 ± 0;0, 2

 where ds and dr are apparent diameters of the moon and sun and i>sand vm are their

 hourly angular velocities, respectively.

 Neugebauer stated that these formulae are only approximately satisfactory.36 It can

 be proved that the values in the Tables 61-66 are on the basis of the formulae:

 These formulae originated from Indian astronomy.37 It should be kept in mind that
 the above formulae are based on solar and lunar apparent radiuses (not apparent

 rs = (5.5/20) • Vs (1)

 rm = (5/247) • Vm (2)

 Pedersen (2002).

 35 Neugebauer ( 1 962, pp. 1 05-1 06).

 36 Ibid.

 37 For the Indian origin of these formulae, see Brahmagupta (1970, p. 118), Suter (1997, pp. 78-80) and
 Neugebauer (1962, pp. 57-59). Ibn Masrur pp. 81-82, explicitely cites these formulae from al-Khwarizmi's
 Zij (of course multiplies them by 2 to obtain ds and dm), however there is no explicit mention of them in
 the Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi's Zij. For the method underlying these formulae, see Eduardo Millas
 Vendrell (1963, pp. 78-79). It is important to know that Ibn Masrur, pp. 81-82 also mentions two other
 formulae from al-Khwarizmi's Zij concerning the computation of ds and dm as follows:

 diameters) corresponding to their diurnal (not hourly) angular velocities. Therefore,

 the values of vs and vm appearing in Tables 61-66, should be multiplied by 24 to yield

 diurnal velocities (i.e., Vs and Vm). The above formulae also give the same values for

 the ratios that Neugebauer has mentioned. The values with interval of 6° in anomaly
 were recomputed based on the formulae mentioned above and the values are shown
 in Table 1. For the angular diameter of the sun, since the accuracy of the values for
 hourly motions are in second of arc, therefore each tabular value corresponds to a
 set of angular diameters in such a way not to exceed the range: -4" ^ A ^ 4". For
 the angular diameter of the moon, there appears an approximately constant shift of

 - 2" . This may imply that the formula underlying the tabular values for the moon was

 slightly different from the one mentioned above. However, the pattern of errors indi-
 cates that computations have been carried out well. According to the Tables 61-66,

 the values given for rm, rsand v^/h, v° /h vary in the following ranges:

 0; 15,40° < rs < 0; 16,54° 0; 14,38° < rm < 0; 17, 17°

 0;2,22° < v°Jh < 0;2,34° 0;30,12° < v°Jh < 0;35,40°

 Based on this evidence, we are able to conclude the presence of the notion of annu-

 lar solar eclipse, because where the moon is at apogee, its angular diameter is less than

 that of the sun. Since the above formulae originated from Indian astronomy, it is very

 likely that these tables have been taken from the original version of al-KhwarizmVs

 Zfjr.

 1.3.2 Table of solar eclipse

 There is a stronger evidence that supports the presence of annular solar eclipse in the
 al-Khwarizmi's Zlj , that this also interestingly concerns the values obtained above.
 Table 78 of al-KhwarizmVs Zlj provides the digits of obscurity and the value for
 half duration of solar eclipse (immersion) in minutes of arc, both corresponding to
 the argument of latitude (see Table 3). Indeed, there is no clear explanation on the
 rules concerning how one should use Table 78.38 However, there is just an erroneous
 addition by a second hand in Chapter 35 that gives general description about it. This
 description, ambiguously relates the effect of the latitudinal lunar parallax with the
 maximal digits of obscurity appeared in Table 78 (i.e., equivalent to 12; 48d at perigee
 and 10; 48d at apogee). Neugebauer tried to interpret the text by relating these val-
 ues to the latitudinal lunar parallax and even changed the value of 10; 48d to 10; 44d

 without further explanation.39

 It should be noted that Islamic astronomers generally presented the lunar parallax
 in latitude as a function of zenithal distance of the highest point of the ecliptic (with

 ds = Vs- ( Vs/5 + Vs/4) -+ds = '' Vs/20 and dm = 10((Vm/10)/24.7) -> dm = 10VW247.
 It is obvious that these formulae are equivalent to the formulae 1 and 2, respectively.

 38 Suter (1997, pp. 94-96) has previously declared that Chapter 35 of the Zlj is unclear and incomplete.
 He did not analyze the structure of the table, rather tried to show the role of the argument of latitude and
 lunar parallax in a numerical example.

 Table 2 Comparing solar eclipse limits^A/ in al-Khwarizmi's model and Ptolemy's one

 508 H.-R. Giahi Yazdi

 Case Al-KhwarizmT's solar eclipse limits Ptolemy's solar eclipse limits

 At apogee 6;37° > QM > 0° or 180° > QM > 173; 23° 90° > QM > 84° or 276° > QM > 270°

 as a function of argument of latitude. On the other hand, it is very unusual that the

 author states that the latitudinal lunar parallax is computed based on digits. It is obvi-

 ous that the unit of measuring the latitudinal lunar parallax is degree or minutes of arc

 and not digits. I will demonstrate that the values of digits in Table 78 have nothing to

 do with the latitudinal lunar parallax. This table shows a very similar structure com-

 pared to Table VI 8 of the Almagest although there are some interesting differences
 between them. Table 78 consists of two sections. The left section tabulates the values

 for the case where the moon is at apogee and the right one for where the moon is at

 perigee. The values given for argument of latitude are rounded off to 30 in minutes of

 arc. In tables of both Ptolemy and al-KhwarizmT, the limit of solar eclipse (argument

 of latitude) at perigee increases by increasing the angular diameters of the moon and

 sun.

 Al-KhwarizmT's table gives two different limits for the "argument of latitude"

 (QM): one for perigee and apogee and another for east and west of each node (see
 Table 2). 42 Here, QM = 0° indicates the exact point of the ascending node. In Ptol-

 emy's table, however, there is a single difference in limits between perigee and apogee.
 Since in such kind of tables, astronomers have not considered the effect of the lunar

 parallax in latitude in computing limits of solar eclipse, it is unexpected to see any
 difference between the limits given for east or west of each node in Al-KhwarizmT's
 table.

 In Table 78, like Table VI 8 in the Almagest , the maximum values of obscurity (at

 mid-eclipse), have been tabulated in digits corresponding to the argument of latitude.
 For the case where the moon is at apogee, the value maximal for the digits is 10; 48d
 and at perigee is 12; 44d.

 With regard to the variation of rm, rsin the al-Khwarizmf s Zij , one can obtain the

 greatest values of obscurity (in digits) at mid-eclipse (where QM = 0) by the follow-
 ing formulae43:

 At apogee: 12.(Min rm)/(Mean rs) = 12.(14; 38716; 17') = 10;47d

 41 See Toomer (1998, p. 306).

 42 See also Neugebauer (1962, p. 126).

 43 Indeed, Table 3 gives this value equal to 10; 48d . It is interesting to consider that, the least possible value
 of a linear magnitude for an annular eclipse is 0.904 and for the total one the greatest value is 1 .08 1 (see
 Meeus 2004, p. 1 19). Therefore, multiplying these values by 12 gives us the corresponding values in digits
 equal to 10; 50, 53d and 12; 58, 19d, respectively.

 Al-Khwarizmi and annular solar eclipse 509

 At perigee: 12. (Max rm)/(Mean rs) = 12.(17; 17'/16; 17') = 12;44d
 This shows that the author applies the same value for the mean angular diameter
 of the sun at both apogee and perigee, while it takes into account the variation of

 angular diameter of the moon at apogee and at perigee separately. According to Table

 78, QM = 0 means that the moon has to be aligned concentrically with respect to the
 sun at mid eclipse. Thus when the value of digits equals to 10; 47d where QM = 0 (at
 apogee), it shows that the author knew that such a case would lead to the annular solar

 eclipse where the sun is not totally covered by the moon, because the value of digits
 is less than 12 at mid eclipse. At perigee with the value of digits equal to 12; 48d,
 there would be a total solar eclipse. It seems that confining the variations of the solar

 angular diameter to its mean value was meant to avoid extending the numbers of digits
 and making the table too complex.

 The computational method behind the values of half eclipse durations (immersion),

 T in Table 78 is another important subject. The maximum value of immersion in min-
 utes of arc at apogee and at perigee (where QM = 0) are obtained by the following
 relations:

 At apogee: T = (Min rm) + (Mean rs) = 14;38' + 16; 17' = 30;55'
 At perigee: T = (Max rm) + (Mean rs) = 17; 17' + 16; 17' = 33; 34'

 To recalculate the other values of immersion, it is necessary to primarily obtain the

 inclination of the lunar orbit with respect to the ecliptic/ (or the maximal value of the

 lunar ecliptic latitude) used in al-Khwarizml's model. In Fig. 2, we have:

 cotg(/) = QM/MS

 (at apogee) cotg(i) = 6; 37°/0; 30, 55° and (at perigee) cotg(i) = 7; 1 1°/0; 33, 34°
 Both above formulae lead to i = 4; 27°. 44 Thus by taking the values of QM from the

 table, the intermediate values of MS are obtained by the following formula:45

 MS = QM/coigii) MS = QM • tg(i) (3)

 44 This value is in good agreement with the maximal value given for the lunar latitude in Table 23 of the
 Zlj (equal to i = 4; 30°, see Suter 1997, p. 134). Ibn Hibinta (1987, vol. 1, p. 176) also cites the same value
 from the original version of al-Khwarizmi's Zlj.

 45 Indeed, this formula is based on the plane trigonometry, and it gives approximate results. Since in
 Fig. 2, the sides of the spherical triangle are small in degrees, ancient astronomers generally dealt with it
 as a plane triangle (See Pedersen 1 974, pp. 227-228). However, it should be noted that the difference is

 negligible in most cases. The modern exact formula is based on the spherical trigonometry. By using the
 Napier formulae, we have:
 sin (QM) = tg (MS) • tg(90 - /) -► tg(Af 5) = sin(^M) • tg(i). See Smart (1999, pp. 14-15).
 The values recomputed of T (see formula 7) based on the values of MS derived from the Napier formula, are
 shown in Table 3. Comparing these values with those derived from formulae 3 and 7 indicate it is unlikely
 that an exact spherical formula(e), similar to the above one, underlie the tabular values (see Table 3). On
 the other hand, historical evidence from the Toledan Tables support the idea that the formula is based on
 the plan trigonometry rather than the exact method.

 a Suter (1997, p. 193) mentions the value of 4;37d from another manuscript in footnote. It seems that this
 value to be correct, because the difference of this value with our computation is -9, therefore it lies well

 between previous value of difference: -6 and the succeeding one: -11. Moreover, the value of 4;37d is in
 agreement with the computation that was carried out based on the "coefficient method" (see Table 4). On
 the other hand, Pedersen (2002, pt. 4, p. 1461) cites this value from the Toledan Tables , in which a similar
 table appears based on al-Khwarizmts Zlj (see below).

 Al-KhwarizmT and annular solar eclipse 5 1 1

 Now the values of digits d corresponding to QM are computed by means of the
 following formulae:

 at apogee: d = (1 - (MS/ 0; 30, 55)) • 10;48 (4)

 at perigee: d = (1 - (MS/ 0; 33, 34)) • 12;44 (5)

 In Ibn Muthana's commentary on al-Khwarizmfs ZTj , the following formula appears

 for computing the values of immersion in hours and minutes46:

 7h = 24'/ (rs + rm)2 - MS2/(Vm - Vs) (6)

 where Vm and Vs are daily angular velocities of the moon and sun, respectively.

 To compute the values of immersion in minutes of arc, the above formula should

 be modified as follows:

 T = J (rs + rm)2 - MS2 (7)

 Therefore, it is plausible to suppose that the values of solar eclipse table were basically

 computed based on the formula 7. Of course, one should enter rm ( min.) and rs (mean)
 (at apogee) and rm (max.) and rs (mean) (at perigee) (For the values, see above).
 The following relations also give the values of immersion in minutes of arc based on

 digits:

 At apogee: T = 30;55v^(21;36 - d)/ 10; 48 (8)
 At perigee: T = 33; 34^(25; 28 - rf)/12;44 (9)

 It should be noted that the formulae 8 and 9 are equivalent to the formula 7, all of

 which resulting in similar values for T.

 The recomputed values of T , based on the formula 7, are shown in Table 3. The dif-
 ferences between the recomputed values and the tabular values may have originated

 from the errors of copyists or from original computations. It is possible to distinguish
 between them in some extent, based on some evidence.

 For instance, the divergence in minutes of immersion corresponding to QM =
 6; 30° and QM = 3° (at apogee) and for QM = 7° and QM = 4° (at perigee) may
 be justified as errors of copyists. Particularly for the case of QM = 4° the error is -40
 indicating that the correct value is 27;53r rather than 27; 13'. In the Abjad numerical

 system, if the original computed minutes of that tabular value would be "53=^",
 it could erroneously be read "13=2*" which the latter value appears in Table 3.

 This conjecture was confirmed by considering the values given in the solar eclipse
 table that appeared in the Toledan Tables. Toomer proved that this table was taken
 from the al-Khwarizmfs ZTj.41 The interesting fact is that, for the case QM - 4°
 (at perigee) the Toledan Tables give the correct value of 27;53' which is similar to

 46 See Goldstein (1967, pp.138, 139, 241).

 47 See Toomer (1968, pp. 86-87) .

 our computation. On the other hand, for the case QM = 5; 30° (at perigee) it gives
 an incorrect value equal to 21; 17' (instead of 21 ;37r that appears in al-Khwarizml's

 Zlj ), therefore there is a miscopying of 37 = as 17 = Ji. Of course, there are other
 serious errors in minutes of immersion corresponding to QM = 6; 30° (at apogee)

 and QM - T (at perigee), that they cannot be justified easily.48

 However, it is odd that the recomputed values for digits (based on the formulae 4

 and 5) have enormous differences with the tabular ones, whereas employing the values

 computed for digits in formulae 8 and 9 yields good results for minutes of immersion

 T . Since the errors in digits follow two systematic patterns, thus it seems that they

 were computed based on the other two formulae. The errors for the values of digits at

 apogee follow a dwindling pattern and at perigee follow a cumulative one (see Table 3).
 A simple analysis shows that the ratio of each tabular value with its corresponding

 recomputed value is 1 .055 at apogee and 0.970 at perigee.49 Therefore, the formulae 4

 and 5 need the following slight modifications (for the recomputed results see Table 4,
 column for coefficients):

 At apogee: d = 1.055(1 - (MS/0;30,55)) • 10;48 (10)

 At perigee: d = 0.970(1 - (MS/0;33,34)) • 12;44 (11)

 The main issue is to define the role of the mentioned coefficients in computations. It is

 not justifiable to consider that these coefficients were originally used in the formulae.

 However, if we multiply the mentioned coefficients by the maximum digits, they will

 result in the following formulae:

 At apogee: d = (1 - (MS/ 0; 30, 55)) • 11;23,38 (12)

 At perigee: d = (1 - (MS/0; 33, 34)) • 12;21,4 (13)

 This idea that the values for digits were computed based on the different values of max-

 imum digits seems to be peculiar at first. But the interesting fact is that the maximum

 values for digits (in the formulae 12 and 13) are very approximate compared to those
 we find in the al-SabV Zlj of al-Battanl (as 1 1 ;23,30 and 12;33,0).50 However, if we

 replace the above maximal values for digits with values that appear in the al-Sabi'Zlj ,
 it is necessary to replace the denominators (the maximal value of immersion for each
 case) with those values that appear in the al-SabV Zlj as well51 :

 At apogee: d = ( 1 - (MS/0;31,0)) . 11;23,30 (14)

 At perigee: d = (1 - (MS/0;34, 0)) • 12;33,0 (15)

 48 Cf. ibid. Pedersen (2002, pt. 4, p. 1461) also cites the values as 27;52' and 27;53' of two different
 manuscripts of the Toledan Tables. Of course there are other discrepancies between the values given in the
 Toledan Tables and al-Khwarizml's Zlj that do not help us in interpreting the difference between the tabular

 and computed values of al-Khwarizml's Zlj.

 49 It is impossible to define the exact value of these ratios, because there are small differences from one to

 another parameter.

 50 See Nallino (1969, pt. 2, p. 91).

 51 For these values, see ibid.

 It is also important to recognize by which value of i computations of MS were origi-
 nally carried out. The computed values of MS in the formula 14 (based on i = 4; 27°)

 lead to good results for digits at apogee, but at perigee, with the formula 15, there

 appears a shift in range of -11 to -13, approximately (see Table 4). This approxi-
 mate constant shift indicates that the value i = 4; IT could be applied in computation.
 However, it is possible that the underlying values have been transformed from al-SabV

 ZTj based on a careless computation or adoption.52 This conjecture may be confirmed

 by considering that in the al-SabV ZTj , the values of digits are given corresponding to
 the lunar latitude, (not argument of latitude, as it appears in the al-Khwarizmts ZTj,
 see Fig. 2). The values recomputed based on the formulae 10, 11 (coefficients) and
 14, 15 (al-Battani's values with i = 4; 27° and i = 4; 32°) are shown in Table 4.

 We should do some computations to understand the relation between al-Khwarizml's
 tabular values and those appearing in the al-SabV ZTj. In Fig. 2, KM = which is
 the lunar latitude. So we have:

 52 Of course my research showed that al-Battani's values with i = 4; 32° produce good results as well,
 particularly in the first half of the table. But in the second half it produces a systematic increasing pattern

 of errors that makes it difficult to accept this parameter of i underlying the tabular values at perigee. On the
 other hand, it is unjustifiable to suppose that different values for i were independently used at apogee and
 at perigee.

 sin(i') = 0/S2M (16)

 By considering i = 4; 27° and the values for /?, taken from al-Sabi' ZTj (see Table 5),
 the corresponding values of QM are computed by the above formula. Now, based
 on each computed values for QM, we take its corresponding value of digits from
 al- Khwarizmfs table53 and modify it with its computed difference for the nearest

 value of digits at both apogee and perigee (for the values of differences see Table 4,
 column 3, section of apogee and perigee).54 The obtained results are very close to
 those appearing for solar eclipse digits in the al-Sabi ' ZTj (see Table 5). As a whole,
 this analysis indicates the values of immersion were probably computed based on a

 relatively correct formula, whereas the values for digits were taken from another table

 or they were computed based on a method irrelevant to the computational procedure
 of the minutes of immersion as it was discussed above. If the value for digits have been

 taken from al-Battanl's ZTj , then it is plausible to suppose that these values stem from

 al-Majrltl's manipulation, particularly we know that al-Majrltl provided a summary

 of al-Sabi ' ZTj.55

 This raises several questions:

 1- Did al-Khwarizml's original ZTj include eclipse digits or not?

 2- Can we suppose that al-Majrltl himself awkwardly juxtaposed the values of digits

 and arguments of latitude without doing precise computation?

 3- Did al-Majrltl find serious errors in al-Khwarizml's digits or he simply preferred

 the tabular values of al-Sabi' Z' jl

 Since, we may assume that the sections pertaining to the values for digits were insep-

 arable parts of each solar eclipse table, it is very unlikely that there were no eclipse

 digits in al-Khwarizml's original zTj , having in mind that Muslim astronomers were
 familiar with the structure of such tables through Almagest. It is possible that al-Majrltl

 preferred those digits in the al-Sabi ' ZTj but made serious mistakes in their adoption

 and transfer. This conjecture may be supported by the fact that the tabular values for

 digits in the al-Sabi ' ZTj correspond to the values for lunar latitude and not for argument
 of latitude, as seen in the al- Khwarizmfs ZTj.

 2 Concluding remarks

 For a long period of time, historians of astronomy have simply introduced al-Battanl
 (d. 137 A.H./929 A.D.) as the pioneer in Islamic astronomy (or even in the history
 of astronomy) who knew the possibility of annular solar eclipse.56 I have not dealt

 53 Since the values of QM are not the same as those appear in Table 3, in most cases, it is necessary to
 interpolate the corresponding values for digits, based on the tabular values.

 54 If the value of difference is negative, it should be added to the obtained value of digit. For instance, for
 QM = 4; 59° (at perigee), the corresponding value for digit is equal to 3; 46d (see Table 3). By adding +9
 (the nearest value of difference), it yields 3; 55d which is very close to 4d that appears in al-Battanl's table.

 55 See Ibn al-Qiftl (1903, p. 326).

 pedia of the History of Arabic Science , vol. 1, p. 47; see "al-Battanf by Hartner in DSB, vol. 1, p. 51 1.

 a It should be noted that according to the rule mentioned in Footnote 54, the value recomputed of QM =
 0; 16° lies nearer to the QM= 0; 30° in al-Khwarizml's table (see Table 4). Its difference with al-Battani's

 digit is zero, whereas the difference for succeeding entry is (1 1 ;23,30d- 10; 48d=0;35,30d). Thus, based on
 the mentioned rule, the difference obtained equal to zero may not be meaningful. However in view of the
 fact that for most cases the value of difference between each couple nearside recomputed al-Battani's digits
 is on scale of 0;1 or 0;2, therefore such interpolation scheme does not produce serious problem except for
 d = 11.

 with this issue in this article.57 But based on this research, there is no doubt that the

 notion of annular solar eclipse took roots from the early period of Islamic astronomy.58

 Obviously our knowledge about al-KhwarizmVs ZTj mostly originates from the recen-

 sion of al-Majiiti and two commentaries written by Ibn al-Muthanna and Ibn Masrur.
 However, it is difficult to separate materials based on al-Khwarizml's own ZTj from

 those originating from the later additions. As for the table of solar eclipse, it can be
 said that it is a mixture of materials from al-Khwarizml's original ZTj and later addition

 probably from al-SabV ZTj. It seems that the values for immersion (in Table 78) are
 derived from the earliest version of al-KhwarizmVs ZTj and not from later additions

 (see above). Based on the parameters of the angular diameters of the sun and moon,
 used in Table 78, it can be concluded that they originated from Indian astronomy.

 This means that the concept of annular eclipse was probably known in early Islamic

 astronomy based on knowledge transfer rather than direct observation of such a phe-
 nomenon by al-Khwarizml or his contemporaries. This hypothesis may be confirmed

 by considering the fact that al-BIrunl by citing al-Iranshahrl's report on annular eclipse,
 stated that the concept of annular eclipse could be concluded from Indian astronomy,

 57 I have dealt with the problem of al-Battani's contribution to annular solar eclipse in a chapter of my
 doctoral dissertation. See Giahi Yazdi (2009, pp. 132-140).

 58 To support this hypothesis, we can also refer to the Debarnot's research, in which she introduced a trace
 of the notion of annular eclipse in the Habash's Zij (see Debarnot 1987, p. 50). For a detailed analysis, see
 also Giahi Yazdi (2009, pp. 96-98).

 but that its authenticity would be proved by observation.59 This implies that Islamic

 astronomers knew about the possibility of this phenomenon before al-BTrunl's era,

 probably through translations of the Indian astronomical texts into Arabic during the

 early stage of the translation movement in the Abbasid era of eighth and ninth centu-
 ries. However, it seems that in the absence of observational evidence, there is no clear

 explanation of such a phenomenon in the works prior to al-BIrunl.

 The novelty in al-Khwarizml's approach seems to be employment of the Indian

 values of angular diameters in a solar eclipse table. Al-Khwarizml demonstrated effec-

 tiveness of his method clearly by computing non-Ptolemaic values for solar eclipse
 magnitudes, which it led to the possibility of annular eclipse. However, his theories

 were apparently not immune from manipulations throughout history.
