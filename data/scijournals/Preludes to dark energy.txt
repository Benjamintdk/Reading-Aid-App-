 Abstract According to modern physics and cosmology, the universe expands at
 an increasing rate as the result of a "dark energy" that characterizes empty space.

 Although dark energy is a modern concept, some elements in it can be traced back to

 the early part of the twentieth century. I examine the origin of the idea of zero-point
 energy, and in particular how it appeared in a cosmological context in a hypothesis
 proposed by Walther Nernst in 1916. The hypothesis of a zero-point vacuum energy
 attracted some attention in the 1920s, but without attempts to relate it to the cosmo-

 logical constant that was discussed by Georges Lemaître in particular. Only in the late

 1960s, was it recognized that there is a connection between the cosmological constant

 and the quantum vacuum. As seen in retrospect, many of the steps that eventually led

 to the insight of a kind of dark energy occurred isolated and uncoordinated.

 1 Introduction

 Since the late 1990s, when observations of type la supernovae showed the expansion

 of the universe to be increasing, the "dark energy" supposed to be responsible for the

 acceleration has been a hot topic in physics and cosmology. The standard view is that

 the dark energy - a name coined in connection with the discovery1 - is a manifesta-
 tion of the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein nearly a century ago. There

 is another side of the new of mysterious form of cosmic energy. From the perspective

 1 The term "dark energy" may first have appeared in the title of a scientific article in Huterer and
 Turner (1999).

 of quantum field theory, empty space is characterized by a "zero-point energy," which

 has the property that its associated pressure is negative and thus makes space expand.
 To many physicists and cosmologists, the cosmological constant and the zero-point
 energy density of vacuum are just two names for the same thing.2

 This article is not really about dark energy, but it deals with what might be called

 the prehistory of some of the key elements that eventually coalesced into the modern

 concept of dark vacuum energy. In this sense, namely, that an account of the past is

 structured and selected with an eye on the present, it may be said to be teleological or

 "presentist" history of science. However, I do not allow present knowledge to inter-

 fere with my description of the events of the past and thus do not violate accepted
 historiographical standards.

 This article is largely limited to the period from about 1910 to 1935, a period that

 with some justification can be called the childhood of vacuum energy. It is possible to

 trace the concept further back in time, even to the days of Newton.3 However, if one

 wants to point to pre-quantum and pre-relativity analogies to dark energy, a more sen-

 sible arena might be the ethereal worldview of the late nineteenth century. The general

 idea that cosmic space is permeated by an unusual form of hidden energy - a dark
 energy of some sort - was popular during the Victorian era, where space was often
 identified with the ether. The generally accepted ethereal medium existed in many
 forms, some of them assuming the ether to be imponderable while others assuming

 that it was quasi-material and only differed in degree from ordinary matter. The ether

 was sometimes thought of as a very tenuous, primordial gas. According to the vortex

 theory, cultivated by British physicists in particular, the discreteness of matter (atoms)

 was epiphenomenal, derived from stable dynamic configurations of a perfect fluid.

 This all-pervading fluid was usually identified with the continuous ether. The highly

 ambitious vortex theory was not only a theory of atoms, it was a universal theory of
 ether (or space) and matter, indeed of everything.4

 The point is that by the end of the nineteenth century, few physicists thought of

 "empty space" as really empty, but rather as filled with an active ethereal medium.

 H. A. Lorentz and other physicists in the early twentieth century often spoke of the

 ether as equivalent to a vacuum, but it was a vacuum that was far from nothingness.5
 Although Lorentz was careful to separate ether and matter, his ether was "the seat of
 an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations . . . [and] endowed with a

 certain degree of substantiality."6 However, the popular belief in a dynamically active
 ether was rarely considered in astronomical or cosmological contexts.

 Among the firm believers in the ether as a storehouse of potential energy was the

 English physicist Oliver Lodge, who has been called a "remote ancestor" of the modern

 analysis in Rugh and Zinkernagel (2002), where the concept of vacuum energy is dealt with from the
 perspective of philosophy of science.

 quantum vacuum (see also Sect. 4).7 As another example, perhaps an even more dubi-
 ous ancestor, consider the French psychologist and amateur physicist Gustave LeBon,

 the discoverer of "black light" and author of the best-selling The Evolution of Mat-

 ter. In this time-typical and hugely popular book, LeBon pictured electrons and other

 charged particles as intermediates between ordinary matter and the ether. They were

 "the last stage but one of the disappearance of matter," the last stage being represented

 by "the vibrations of the ether." Matter formed by electric particles would eventually

 radiate away all their stored energy and return to "the primitive ether whence they
 came . . . [and which] represents the final nirvana to which all things return after a
 more or less ephemeral existence."8

 Analogies and precursors apart, in this article I start (Sects. 2, 3) with examining the

 concept of zero-point energy as it first appeared in Max Planck's the so-called second
 quantum theory of 1911. Although Planck's theory failed to win general approval,
 the associated hypothesis of zero-point energy of atomic oscillators remained alive.
 From about 1920 the hypothesis received unexpected support from the half-integral

 quantum numbers that turned up experimentally in spectroscopy and were eventually

 justified by the new quantum mechanics. However, in this early period, the zero-point

 energy, if real, was considered a property of material systems and not of empty space.

 In Sect. 4, 1 turn to a remarkable exception from this state of affairs, Walther Nernst's

 unorthodox, yet in some ways prophetic theory of a cosmic ether filled with a huge

 amount of zero-point energy. Nernst's theory is sometimes mentioned by modern phys-

 icists, but rarely taken seriously or placed in its proper historical context.9 Although

 Nernst's ideas did not make much of an impact on mainstream physics, they inspired a

 few German physicists to apply quantum theory and thermodynamic reasoning to the

 universe at large. Studies by Otto Stern and Wilhelm Lenz are particularly interesting;
 I deal with these in Sect. 5.

 Finally, in Sect. 6, 1 turn to the cosmological scene of the 1920s and 1930s. Fol-
 lowing a brief consideration of Einstein's resurrection of the ether, I look at how a

 few physicists came to realize that the cosmological constant can be understood as a

 vacuum energy density. That this is the case is not surprising from a formal point of

 view, yet the insight was only spelled out in an address that Georges Lemaître gave in

 1933. As to the later development, leading to a connection between the cosmological

 constant and the vacuum of quantum field theory, I only sketch a few of its steps.

 7 Rowlands ( 1 990, p. 285), a biographer of Lodge, comments: "The infinite energy density of the zero-point
 vacuum field fluctuations is almost indistinguishable from the infinite elasticity of the universal ethereal
 medium." Indeed, modern physicists sometimes speak of gravity as the "elasticity of the vacuum" and relate

 the quantum vacuum to the ether. According to Davies (1982, p. 582), the late-nineteenth century physicists

 "would surely have been gratified to learn that in its modern quantum form, then the ether has materialised
 at last." For other suggestions that the ether has been resuscitated in modern theories of the vacuum, see
 Wilczek (1998) and Barone (2004).

 8 LeBon (1905, pp. 313, 315).

 ' Sciama (1978) was among the first to call attention to Nernst's study and its similarity to modern views of
 the vacuum. See also Sciama (1991, p. 140), where he mentions Nernst's theory, but only "parenthetically"

 and without providing it with a reference.

 2 Planck's second quantum theory

 The concept of zero-point energy has its roots in a reformulation of the original ver-
 sion of quantum theory proposed by Max Planck in 1900. The revised version was
 presented in a series of works from 1911 to 1913. Planck first introduced his new

 radiation hypothesis or "second theory" in an address to the German Physical Society
 of 3 February 191 1, and he subsequently developed it in several papers and lectures,

 including his report on heat radiation delivered to the first Solvay Conference taking

 place in Brussels from 30 October to 3 November 1911. The new theory became more
 widely known from the exposition that appeared in the second edition of Planck's
 Theorie der Wärmestrahlung published in early 191 3. 10

 Although Planck in his original theory of 1900 had treated emission and absorption

 of radiation symmetrically, in his second theory - at the time generally known as the

 "theory of quantum emission" - he assumed, on the one hand, that only the emission
 of radiation occurred in discrete energy quanta. The electrodynamic emission of these

 quanta would be governed by a probabilistic law. Absorption, on the other hand, was

 supposed to occur in accordance with classical theory, that is, continuously. This fea-
 ture appealed to physicists who considered Planck's original theory as too-radical a
 break away from classical physics. For example, in an address of December 1912,
 Robert A. Millikan judged the new theory to be "the most fundamental and the least

 revolutionary form of quantum theory, since it modifies classical theory only in the
 assumption of discontinuities in time , but not in space , in the emission (not in the

 absorption) of radiant energy."11 Although the radiation was emitted with discrete

 energy values in Planck's theory, and the entire energy emitted at once, the oscillators

 did not possess intrinsically discontinuous energies. They could take on any energy,
 but the emission would only occur when the energy had reached values of nhv , where

 n is an integer. As Planck admitted in a letter to Paul Ehrenfest of 23 May 1913: "I
 fear that your hatred of the zero-point energy extends to the electrodynamic emission

 hypothesis that I introduced and that leads to it. But what's to be done? For my part,
 I hate discontinuity of energy even more than discontinuity of emission"*2 As stated

 in the letter, a new and mysterious "zero-point energy" was part and parcel of Planck's

 new theory.

 Based on the ideas underlying the second theory, Planck calculated the average
 energy of an oscillator vibrating with frequency v to vary with the absolute tempera-
 ture T as

 are conveniently collected in Planck (1958). For historical studies of Planck's second theory, see Kuhn (1978,
 pp. 235-254), Needell (1980), and Mehra and Rechenberg (1982-2000, vol. 1, pp. 124-127, 146-150). See

 The values of the quantized energy levels of an oscillator can thus be written as

 Ê - En - E„-' ) = (n + 0 hv,

 where n = 0, 1, 2, ... As Planck pointed out, this result implies that at T = 0 (or
 for T 0) the average energy is not zero but equals the finite energy 1 /2 hv : "This

 rest-energy remains with the oscillator, on the average, at the absolute zero of temper-

 ature. It [the oscillator] cannot lose it, for it does not emit energy so long that Ü [= É'

 is smaller than hv ."13 In order to derive the experimentally confirmed radiation law

 relating the energy density p to frequency and temperature, Planck appealed to the
 classical limit given by the Rayleigh-Jeans expression

 where k is Boltzmann's constant. By making use of a correspondence argument, he
 obtained in this way the same expression he had derived in 1900:

 p(v, T) = 8tt (-)3- 'c / V ,

 'c / V

 P(v' , T) =

 «Pdf)"1 7~hv'

 According to Max Jammer, Planck's reasoning in 1911 "was probably the earliest

 instance in quantum theory of applying what more than ten years later became known
 as the 'correspondence principle'."14

 In the second edition of his Theorie der Wärmestrahlung , Planck emphasized that

 the existence of a zero-point energy was completely foreign to classical physics. How-

 ever, it seemed to be so much a ghost-like entity that it was difficult to connect to

 experiments. As he noted in his first article of 191 1, since the new energy expression

 of an oscillator differed from the old one by only an additive constant, it would have

 no effect on the spectrum or on the specific heat as given bye = 3Ë/dT. For this
 reason, Walther Nernst's recent confirmation of Einstein's 1907 theory of the specific
 heat of solids could not be used to differentiate between the two radiation hypotheses.

 "Thus, so far it appears not really possible to make a direct experimental test of the

 new expression for Ü [= Ë] he commented.15

 principle, see Whitaker (1985) who argues that Planck was the first to make "active use" of correspondence
 arguments in quantum theory. See also Kuhn (1978, p. 240).

 Planck similarly pointed out that Einstein's controversial theory of light quanta, or

 rather the photoelectric law derived from it, was unable to distinguish between the

 two hypotheses.16 Although he did not think of the zero-point energy as a measurable

 quantity, or one that would otherwise have direct experimental consequences, he did
 mention various phenomena that in a qualitative sense might justify it empirically.
 Among these phenomena was the experimental fact that the energy released in radio-
 active decay remained uninfluenced by even the most extreme cold. Moreover, the
 relativistic mass-energy equivalence E - mc2 led naturally to the assumption of "a

 very considerable intra-atomic amount of energy also a zero absolute temperature."17

 Planck's second quantum theory was short-lived, a major reason being its failure

 to comply with Bohr's atomic theory of 1913 in which both emission and absorption
 of radiation occurred discontinuously. The successful use of Bohr's theory to atomic

 and molecular spectroscopy spoke against Planck's second theory, which nonetheless
 may have inspired Bohr in the development of his ideas of atomic structure.18 At
 any rate, Bohr soon came to the conclusion that Planck's notion of atomic oscillators

 was foreign to his atomic theory. In the conclusion of the third part of the trilogy, he

 expressed his misgivings about the Planckian oscillators because they were "inconsis-
 tent with Rutherford's theory, according to which all the forces between the particles

 of an atomic system vary inversely as the square of the distance apart."19 After all, as

 he said in a lecture in Copenhagen at the end of 1913, "No one has ever seen a Planck's

 resonator, nor indeed even measured its frequency of oscillation; we can observe only

 the period of oscillation of the radiation which is permitted."20

 In an important but an unpublished article of 1916, Bohr emphasized that Planck's

 second theory was inconsistent with the basic assumption that an atomic system can

 exist only in a series of discrete stationary states. He argued that the probability of a

 quantum system being in a state n was given by

 Pn = nr~'

 where r denotes the number of degrees of freedom. For a system of several degrees

 of freedom (r > 1), the probability of the system being in state n = 0 should thus be
 zero. "Such a consideration gives a simple explanation of the mysterious zero-point
 energy," he wrote to the Swedish physicist Carl Wilhelm Oseen.21 In his unpublished

 18 On the relationship between Planck's second theory of quanta and Bohr's atomic theory, see Hirosige
 and Nisio (1964), according to whom Planck's revised theory was of great importance to Bohr's original
 formulation of his theory, as stated in the first part of the 1913 trilogy. On this matter, Heilbron and Kuhn
 (1969, pp. 268-269) disagreed, suggesting that Planck's articles were of no special importance to Bohr.
 However, Kuhn (1978, p. 320) later admitted that the emission mechanism of Planck's second theory was
 most likely of relevance to Bohr's thinking.

 19 Bohr (1913, p. 874). In the first part of the trilogy, Bohr referred to Planck (1911) and Planck (1912a).
 He was also acquainted with the Solvay proceedings and thus with Planck (1912b).

 article, he regained the result that at T = 0 a harmonic oscillator of two degrees of

 freedom would have a non-zero energy, but "This so-called zero-point energy has here

 an origin quite distinct from that in Planck's theory." Bohr elaborated: "In the present

 theory it arises simply from the fact, that . . . there is no probability of a periodic system

 of several degrees of freedom being in the state corresponding to n = 0

 all the systems are therefore in a state corresponding to n = 1 ."22

 Bohr not only applied his theory to the specific heat of hydrogen at low tem-
 peratures, but also to the quantized hydrogen atom he had introduced in his the-
 ory of 1913. According to this theory, the energy levels of the hydrogen atom were

 given by

 2j r2e4m 1

 En = h2~

 where e is the charge of the electron, and m its mass. Since the system has three

 degrees of freedom, Pn = n2. Bohr explained: "This system affords a peculiar case of

 zero-point energy. Strictly there is no sense in considering the state corresponding to
 n = 0, since this would correspond to an infinite negative value for the energy; and in

 order to obtain agreement with experiments it must be assumed that the normal state

 of the system corresponds to n = 1 ."23

 Around 1920, few physicists considered Planck's second theory a viable alternative.

 In a contribution to a special issue of Die Naturwissenschaften celebrating the 10-year

 anniversary of Bohr's atomic theory, Planck admitted that "This second formulation

 of the quantum theory may be considered today, at least in its extreme form, as finally

 disproved."24 What persuaded him was the Stern-Gerlach experiment, which he and

 most other physicists saw as proof of the discrete stationary states postulated by Bohr's
 theory. Yet, although the second theory had been abandoned by 1923, one element
 associated with it continued to live on: the zero-point energy. Planck had himself

 replaced his second quantum theory with a modified "third theory," and in this version
 the zero-point energy survived. In a letter of 1915 to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in
 Leiden he wrote: "I have almost completed an improved formulation of the quantum

 hypothesis applied to thermal radiation. I am more convinced than ever that zero-point
 energy is an indispensable element. Indeed, I believe I have the strongest evidence
 for it."25

 22 Bohr (1981, p. 456). See also Gearhart (2010, pp. 146-147). The unpublished article, intended to appear
 in the April 1916 issue of Philosophical Magazine, was entitled "On the Application of the Quantum
 Theory to Periodic Systems." Owing to Arnold Sommerfeld's new formulation of the quantum theory of
 atoms, Bohr decided to withdraw it shortly before it was to be published. Incidentally, Sommerfeld ignored

 the zero-point energy, which is not mentioned in any of the editions (1919-1924) of his influential book
 Atombau und Spektrallinien.

 3 Half-quanta and zero-point energy

 The assumption of a zero-point energy attracted much attention in the physics com-

 munity, although for more than a decade, it remained uncertain whether the quantity

 was physically real or not.26 Einstein was perhaps the first to come up with a physical

 argument for its existence, which he did in an article of early 1913 co-authored by Otto

 Stern, a young physical chemist who had recently obtained his doctorate in Breslau

 under Otto Sackur and subsequently joined Einstein as his assistant, first in Prague and

 then in Zurich. The two authors, Einstein and Stern, considered the rotational energy
 of a diatomic molecule, as given by

 £rot = ^J(2jTV)2,

 where J is the moment of inertia, and v is the frequency of rotation. For a collection

 of molecules at fixed temperature, they assumed that all molecules would rotate with

 the same speed. Moreover, they took the rotational kinetic energy to be twice as great

 as the kinetic energy of a one-dimensional oscillator vibrating at the same frequency
 v, or equal to its average energy. From these assumptions, they obtained expressions

 for c = dErot/dT in the case of both the first and the second of Planck's hypotheses.
 Einstein and Stern wanted to establish the different experimental consequences of

 the two assumptions. This they did by comparing the corresponding specific heats of

 rotating gas molecules with those measured experimentally. Working at Nernst's lab-

 oratory in Berlin, Arnold Eucken had recently obtained data for molecular hydrogen

 at low temperatures that defied explanation in terms of existing theory.27 According
 to the calculations of Einstein and Stern, a fair agreement with Eucken's curve could

 be obtained if the zero-point energy 1/2 hv were included, while Planck's first the-
 ory led to quite wrong results (Fig. 1). From this followed their cautious conclusion:

 "Eucken's results on the specific heat of hydrogen make probable the existence of a
 zero-point energy equal to hv/ 2."28

 In spite of the appealing agreement between theory and experiment provided by
 the assumption of a zero-point energy, Einstein soon retracted his support of it. For
 one thing, Planck's second quantum theory presupposed harmonic oscillators at fixed
 frequencies, and there was no reason to expect that it would be applicable also to

 molecules rotating at frequencies depending on the temperature. Even more problem-
 atic was that Einstein and Stern, by making use of a zero-point energy, were able to
 derive Planck's radiation law "without recourse to any kind of discontinuities." The

 problem was not the derivation, of course, but that it relied on a zero-point contribu-
 tion to the oscillator energy of hv and not 1/2 hv. Moreover, using the value hv for

 rotating molecules spoiled the agreement with Eucken's measurements on the specific

 26 For the early history of the zero-point energy, see Milloni and Shih (1991) and Mehra and Rechenberg

 article of 1913 showed that he could reproduce the data for low temperatures on the

 basis of statistical mechanics and Planck's first theory and thus without any zero-point

 zero-point energy was not. It was in this context that he assumed the angular momen-

 However, Ehrenfest did not formulate the quantization of angular momentum as a
 general principle, such as Bohr would do independently a few months later (and as
 John Nicholson had done in 1912, apparently without Ehrenfest being aware of it).

 Already in the fall of 1913 Einstein withdrew his support of the zero-point energy,

 and the results were reported in his article with Stern. During the second Solvay Con-
 ference in late October 1913, the question of the zero-point energy was discussed by
 Einstein, Wien, Nernst, and Lorentz. Einstein commented: "I no longer consider the

 arguments for the existence of zero-point energy that I and Mr. Stern put forward to

 29 Ehrenfest (1913). For historical analysis, see Klein (1970, pp. 264-273), Navarro and Pérez (2006,
 pp. 215-223), and Gearhart (2010, pp. 135-138). In his unpublished article of 1916, Bohr criticized
 Ehrenfest's theory and derived from his own theory a curve for the c ( T ) variation that agreed better
 with the data than the one obtained by Ehrenfest. See Bohr (1981, pp. 458-460).

 radiation law showed that this road, based on the hypothesis of zero-point energy,
 leads to contradictions."30 In a letter to Ehrenfest a few days later, he declared the

 zero-point energy "dead as a doornail" ( Mausetot ).31 However, the announcement of

 death was premature.

 Two points with regard to the article by Einstein and Stern should be emphasized.

 First, they did not quantize the rotator, but allowed it to have a continuum of ener-

 gies depending on the temperature. Second, they only attributed a zero-point energy to

 material objects, either oscillating electrons or rotating diatomic molecules, while they
 did not apply the additional energy term to the electromagnetic field. In retrospect,

 this explains how they were able to derive the correct Planck spectrum on the basis of

 the wrong zero-point energy hv. This value happens to be the correct one for the sum

 of the interacting harmonic oscillators and the energy of the electromagnetic field.32

 Far from being dead as a doornail, after 1913 the zero-point energy continued to

 attract a great deal of attention among physicists and physical chemists, in many cases
 independent of Planck's second theory. A possible way to answer the question of a

 zero-point motion might be to study the X-ray diffraction pattern in crystals at low

 temperature. If the atoms in a crystal had a zero-point motion, this would presumably
 influence the intensity distribution in the diffraction pattern. This line of research,

 which eventually led to a "direct proof" of zero-point motion, was pioneered by Peter
 Debye in his studies of 1913-1914, but without leading to a conclusive answer.33

 Another line of research was related to the attempts to separate isotopes by chemical

 means or fractional distillation. The British physicist Fredrick Lindemann, a former

 collaborator of Nernst, showed that in principle such separation would be possible, but

 that it would depend on if there was a zero-point energy: "The amount of separation
 to be expected depends upon . . . whether 'Nullpunktsenergie' is assumed. . . . The

 difference should be measurable if there is no 'Nullpunktsenergie', and it is suggested
 that experiments on the vapour pressure and affinity of isotopes would give valuable

 information on this important point."34 If a zero-point energy were not assumed, the

 expected separation effect would be tiny. However, experiments of the kind proposed
 were unable to settle the question and tell if the zero-point energy existed.

 Arguments somewhat similar to Lindemann's were suggested a few years later by

 Stern, who discussed them with a skeptical Pauli. In a letter of 1960, Stern recalled:

 Pauli and I continually discussed the question of the zero-point energy in Ham-
 burg in the early 1920s. ... I for my part always tried to convert Pauli to the

 30 Einstein (1995, p. 553).

 31 Einstein to Ehrenfest, before 7 November 1913, and also Einstein to Ludwig Hopf, 2 November 1913:
 "One hopes Debije [Debye] will soon demonstrate the incorrectness of the hypothesis of zero-point energy,
 the theoretical untenability of which became glaringly obvious to me soon after the publication of the article
 I coauthored with Mr. Stern." Both letters are reproduced in Einstein (1993, pp. 563-565).

 32 See Milloni and Shih (1991), who discuss the question and what reasons Einstein and Stern might have
 had to ignore the zero-point energy of the field. The shortcomings of the Einstein-Stern article are also
 discussed in Sciama (1991).

 zero-point energy against which he had the gravest hesitations. My main argu-
 ment was that I had calculated the vapour pressure differences of the neon
 isotopes 20 and 22, which Aston had tried in vain to separate by distillation.
 If one calculates without zero-point energy there results such a large differ-
 ence that the separation should have been quite easy. The argument seemed
 (and seems) to me so strong because one does not assume anything else than
 Planck's formula and the fact that isotopes are distinguished only by the atomic

 weight.35

 However, at that time, Pauli remained unconvinced. As mentioned by Stern, as early

 as 1913, he had studied the vapor pressure of monatomic gases and arrived at an

 expression for the heat of vaporization which he interpreted as support of a zero-point

 energy.36 He gave a more elaborate version in a study of 1919, in which he calculated

 the vapor pressure above the surface of a solid body, which he conceived as a collection
 of N atoms vibrating harmonically in three dimensions with frequencies . To obtain

 agreement with experimental data, he suggested that the heat of vaporization at T = 0
 was smaller than the potential energy of the N atoms in the gaseous state. That is,
 in the solid equilibrium state, the atoms were not at rest, but possessed a vibrational

 energy of

 1 3N

 E° = öh^n- z

 z i

 Stern expressed his hope that the zero-point energy of solid bodies would find its inter-

 pretation in "The more recent works of Bohr [in which] this hypothesis in a somewhat
 modified form has acquired a very deep meaning."37

 Rather than considering vaporization, the two young physical chemists Kurt

 Bennewitz and Franz Simon (later Sir Francis Simon), who worked at Nernst's lab-

 oratory in Berlin, studied the melting process at low temperatures. Their complex
 calculations of the melting points of hydrogen, argon, and mercury led them to con-

 clude that the results provided evidence for a zero-point energy. Moreover, they sug-

 gested - correctly, as it later turned out to be - that this quantity was responsible for
 the difficulty in solidifying helium even at very low temperature.38 According to
 Bennewitz and Simon, the zero-point energy in liquid helium would act as an internal

 pressure, expanding it to such a low density that no rigid structure of the atoms could be
 maintained.

 Among the early and most persistent advocates of the zero-point energy was the
 Dutch physicist Willem Keesom, who at the 1913 Wolfkehl meeting in Göttingen
 defended the new Einstein-Stern theory and suggested that the zero-point energy

 might also turn up in the equation of state of monatomic gases.39 Several other speak-

 ers at the Wolfkehl meeting commented on the zero-point energy, including Planck,
 Kamerlingh Onnes, Debye, and Sommerfeld. For a while, the subject was taken seri-

 ously among Dutch physicists in Leiden and Utrecht, where it came up in particular
 in connection with research in magnetism at low temperature.40 As Keesom saw it,

 the evidence in favor of zero-point energy was far stronger than the counterevidence.

 Yet, evidence is not proof, and in the decade after 1911, the problem still remained

 unresolved. As mentioned, the abandonment of Planck's second theory did not imply
 that the idea of zero-point energy was abandoned.

 Einstein would have nothing of it. "It is well known that all theories characterized

 by a 'zero-point energy' face great difficulties when it comes to an exact treatment,"

 he wrote in an article of 1915. "No theoretician," he continued, "can at present utter
 the word 'zero-point energy' without breaking into a half-embarrassed, half-ironic
 smile."41 Yet, several years later, Einstein returned to the question, now with a more

 sympathetic view. In his correspondence with Ehrenfest from 1921 to 1923, he sug-

 gested that the zero-point energy might play a role in the cases of hydrogen and helium.

 Perhaps, he suggested, it might explain the density maximum in helium. However, nei-

 ther Einstein nor Ehrenfest turned his ideas on the subject into publications.42

 According to Bohr's atomic theory, quantum numbers had to be integers, but by the

 early 1920s, a growing amount of evidence indicated that in some cases "half-quanta"

 of the kind first considered by Planck in 191 1 had to be accepted. These half-integral

 quantum numbers first turned up in attempts to understand the band spectra emitted
 by molecules. In 1919, Elmer Imes at the University of Michigan published precision
 experiments on the absorption of HCl and HBr, which showed a distinct gap in the
 center of the pattern of lines.43 In order to explain Imes's data, the Berlin physicist

 Fritz Reiche suggested changing the standard rule for rotational quantization, namely,

 by changing the formula for the energy of a rotator from:

 h 2 / 1'2 h 2

 E"=mS^l 10 £™ = ("' + ïj S 2J ■

 which, since m = 0,1,2,..., implied a zero-point rotational energy. This conclusion,
 that a diatomic molecule cannot exist in a rotation-free state, he justified by Bohr's
 new correspondence principle.44 According to Reiche, the suggestion of rotational
 half-quanta was first suggested by Einstein, "with whom I have often had the oppor-

 tunity to discuss these matters, . . . [and who mentioned] a possible way to change the

 rotational quantization so as to annul the contradiction with observations."45 Although

 the half-quanta were theoretically controversial, they seemed necessary and were
 adopted by several molecular spectroscopists. For example, they were incorporated
 into an influential and more elaborate theory of band spectra that Adolf Kratzer, a

 physicist at the University of Münster, published in 1923. 46

 With the new studies of band spectra in the early 1920s, the concept of zero-point

 energy became respectable among molecular physicists. Yet, it was only in the fall of

 1924 that half-quanta were firmly established in molecular spectroscopy. In a study of

 the spectrum of boron monoxide (BO), Robert S. Mulliken, a young physical chemist
 at Harvard University, concluded that observations could only be understood on the

 assumption of quantum numbers with a minimum value of one half. In a preliminary
 announcement of his results in Nature , he wrote:

 It is probable that the minimum vibrational energy of BO (and doubtless of
 other) molecules is 1 /2 quantum. In the case of molecular rotational energy, the

 necessity of using half quanta is already well established. Analogous relations
 appear in line spectra; e.g. Heisenberg has successfully used half-integral radial
 and azimuthal quantum numbers in explaining the structure and Zeeman effect

 of doublets and triplets.47

 In the full report that appeared in Physical Review in March 1925, Mulliken simi-
 larly concluded that his study "would involve a null-point energy of 1/2 quantum
 each of vibration and rotation" and he related it to Lindemann's investigation of the

 vapor pressures of isotopes.48 His article was widely considered a final confirmation

 of half-quanta and, by implication, a form of zero-point energy. However, in spite of

 being anomalous, the result had almost no effect at all on the crisis in quantum theory
 that a few months later would lead to Heisenberg's formulation of a new quantum

 mechanics - and thereby to a theoretical justification of the zero-point energy of an
 oscillator.

 Here, a brief terminological note may be appropriate. What Planck had originally
 called Restenergie (rest energy) soon became known as Nullpunktsenergie , a name
 used, for example, by Einstein and Stern in their article of 1913. For a while, the
 German term - or sometimes the equivalent "null-point energy" as used by Mullik-

 en - was also used in the English scientific literature, such as exemplified by the articles

 by Lindemann (1919) and Tolman (1920). Only from about 1925, did it become com-
 mon to refer to "zero-point energy." This term may have been used first by Bohr in

 his unpublished article of 1916.

 As indicated in the quotation from Mulliken, half-quanta also played a role in
 some of the attempts to understand what was probably the most serious problem in
 the old quantum theory, namely, the anomalous Zeeman effect. Thus, according to
 young Heisenberg's so-called core model of the atom, electrons could be in a state

 given by the azimuthal quantum number k = 1/2, which was difficult to harmonize
 with the established Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model.49 When Heisenberg introduced
 half-integral quantum numbers, he was originally unaware of the earlier discussion
 related to Planck's second theory and the possibility of a zero-point energy. Pauli
 seems to have directed his attention to this discussion and to Stern's article of 1919;

 Heisenberg also had conversations with Kratzer who informed the former about the

 use of half-quanta in the study of band spectra.50 To make a long story short, despite

 of resistance from Bohr and other leading physicists, the evidence for half-quanta and
 zero-point energy could not be ignored: physicists learned to live with them, if not
 love them.

 212 H. Kragh

 Only with the emergence of quantum mechanics did the concept of zero-point
 energy become really respectable and seen as a consequence of a fundamental physi-
 cal theory. In his famous Umdeutung article of September 1925, Heisenberg applied
 his new formalism to the harmonic oscillator, the result being

 En = (n + l/2)Av.

 For the anharmonic oscillator, he derived a more complicated expression, also involv-
 ing a zero-point energy. Although Heisenberg's result was the same as Planck's for-
 mula of 1911, there was the difference that in the case of quantum mechanics, it
 is valid also for an individual oscillator and not merely as an average. The result
 was duplicated by Erwin Schrödinger in the second of his communications on wave
 mechanics of April 1926, where he commented: "Strangely, our quantum levels are
 precisely the same as in Heisenberg's theory!"51 The formal equivalence between
 wave mechanics and the Göttingen quantum mechanics was only proved a month
 later.

 By the summer of 1926, the zero-point energy was no longer controversial, at least

 not insofar as it concerned material systems. In the later literature on quantum physics,

 it became customary to see the zero-point energy as a straightforward consequence of
 Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for position and momentum. If a harmonic oscil-

 lator were to have zero energy, then both its potential and kinetic energies would have
 to be zero. The case E^oi = 1/2 kx2 = 0 would correspond to a precise knowledge
 of the position of the particle ( x = 0) and thus imply that the momentum p is com-
 pletely uncertain. However, then the mean value of £kin = P2 /2m would be infinite.

 Conversely, for Exm to be zero, Evoi would have to be infinite. A simple calculation
 shows that the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator is equal to the minimum

 energy allowed by the uncertainty principle AjcA p > h /lit, and that this energy is
 just 1/2 hv.

 4 Nernst's cosmic quantum-ether

 The first suggestion of applying the concept of zero-point energy to free space, and in

 this way, turning it into a tool of possible relevance for cosmological research, came

 from an unlikely source. The great physical chemist Walther Nernst had established his

 reputation by pioneering studies in electrochemistry and chemical thermodynamics,

 culminating in 1906 with the heat theorem also known as the third law of thermody-

 namics.52 In its original formulation, the theorem was a method of calculating free
 energies and equilibrium constants from calorimetric data, whereas Nernst resisted
 the later formulation that all entropy differences AS vanish at T = 0.53 It was pri-

 marily for his study in thermodynamics that he was awarded the 1920 Nobel Prize in

 chemistry. The new heat theorem led Nernst from chemistry to quantum physics, a
 move inspired by Einstein's 1907 theory of the specific heats of solids which Nernst
 confirmed in a series of low-temperature experiments conducted around 1910.

 Nernst's debut in quantum theory took place in early 1911, when he submitted an

 article on the theory of specific heats in which he applied quantum theory to diatomic

 gases such as hydrogen. Although Nernst did not quantize the rotating molecule, he
 did arrive at a quantum-based phenomenological expression for the variation of the

 specific heat of a diatomic gas with temperature.54 Later in the same year, he reported

 on his formula and related subjects at the memorable first Solvay Conference, a meet-

 ing of which he was the chief organizer. In Brussels, he listened to Planck's exposition
 of his second quantum hypothesis and its associated concept of zero-point energy. As

 Nernst suggested in the subsequent discussion, the zero-point energy would imply that

 at the absolute zero of temperature a solid body would still have a vapor pressure, a
 claim that Planck denied.55

 About the same time that Nernst entered quantum theory, he took up an interest

 in cosmological questions (Fig. 2). His first excursion into cosmology and cosmic
 physics was not motivated by quantum theory, but by the old and still much-discussed

 question of a universal Wärmetod (heat death) caused by the ever increasing amount
 of entropy (or ever decreasing amount of free energy). This supposed consequence
 of the second law of thermodynamics, first stated in different versions by Hermann
 von Helmholtz, William Thomson and Rudolf Clausius in the mid-nineteenth cen-

 tury, was highly controversial for both scientific and non-scientific reasons because
 it predicted the end of the world, or at least the end of all activity and life in the
 world.56 Nernst's Swedish colleague in physical chemistry, Svante Arrhenius, were

 among those who in the early years of the twentieth century resisted the heat death

 52 The literature on Nernst is extensive. For full biographies, see in particular Barkan (1999) and Bartel
 and Huebener (2007). The scientific studies of Nernst are well discussed in Partington (1953). A useful

 website, with a bibliography of the studies of Nernst and his students, is http://www.nernst.de.

 56 The history of the heat death and its associated concept of a beginning of the world is detailed in Kragh
 (2008), which emphasizes the religious and other nonscientific aspects of the controversy. This study gives
 further references to the literature.

 scenario and suggested cosmic mechanisms that would counter the deadly growth in

 entropy. Probably inspired by Arrhenius's writings, Nernst did the same. Ever since
 1886, when he first became acquainted with Boltzmann's gloomy prediction of an
 unavoidable cosmic heat death, he denied this alleged consequence of the second law
 of thermodynamics.57 For him, as also for several of his colleagues in science, it was

 an intellectual necessity to establish a cosmology that secured eternal evolution in an

 infinite, self-perpetuating universe.

 In a lecture given to the 1912 meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Phy-
 sicians in Münster, Nernst indicated a way in which the world might be saved from
 the heat death without abandoning the second law of thermodynamics. His tentative

 solution involved as major ingredients radioactivity and the ether, with the latter sup-
 posed to be the ultimate end product of radioactive decay. (As mentioned in Sect. 1 ,

 a similar idea had been entertained earlier by LeBon and other authors.) Like the free
 energy, radioactivity was known to decrease irreversibly, but alone it would not do in

 countering the entropy increase. On the contrary, "the theory of radioactive decay of

 57 Nernst attended Boltzmann's inaugural lecture of 1886 in Vienna, in which Boltzmann maintained that
 the heat death followed from thermodynamics (Nernst 1921, p. 1). Historical and other studies that deal
 with Nernst's cosmological and astrophysical views include Kragh (1995), Bartel and Huebener (2007,
 pp. 306-326), Browne (1995), and Huber and Jaakkola (1995).

 the elements has augmented the above-mentioned degradation of energy with a corre-

 spondingly steady degradation of matter, and thus has only doubled the prospects of

 an Armaggeddon of the universe [ Götterdämmerung des Weltalls ]."58

 Nernst was not the first to use radioactivity in a cosmological context. One year

 earlier, the Austrian physicist, Arthur Erich Haas had reached the same conclusion,

 that radioactive decay constituted one more argument for the end of the universe.59
 Although this was a conclusion Haas happily welcomed, Nernst thought he was able
 to circumvent it and turn it into an argument for a static and eternally active world.

 This is where the ether entered, namely, as a medium that ex hypothesi counteracted

 the degradation of matter and energy. According to Nernst

 The atoms of all elements of the universe will sooner or later entirely dissolve in

 some primary substance [ Ursubstanz ], which we would have to identify with the

 hypothetical medium of the so-called luminiferous ether. In this medium ... all

 possible configurations can presumably occur, even the most improbable ones,
 and consequently, an atom of some element (most likely one with high atomic

 weight) would have to be recreated from time to time. . . . This means, at any
 rate, that the cessation of all events no longer needs to follow unconditionally as

 a consequence of our present view of nature.60

 Nernst's cosmic hypothesis was admittedly speculative, and he emphasized that it
 should not be taken as a new cosmological theory but merely as an illustration of

 what he called "the thermodynamic approach" to the study of the universe. His chief

 hypothesis, an active ether in constant interaction with matter, was not particularly
 novel, and in 1912, he did not refer to either quantum theory or zero-point energy.

 However, in an article 4 years later, he did make this connection.

 In this article, a lengthy communication to the German Physical Society read on

 28 January 1916, Nernst proposed that empty space (or ether, as he saw it) was filled

 with electromagnetic zero-point radiation. Although he found the zero-point energy

 useful for the energy-rich ether, he was not satisfied with Planck's version of it because
 he felt it violated the universal validity of electrodynamics. His own alternative, he

 emphasized, "succeeds in taking over without changes the most important laws of the

 old physics, [and this] I consider not only an advantage but also a probable reason for

 admitting it as acceptable."61 Contrary to Planck and other early researchers, Nernst's

 zero-point energy was a concept that characterized both material objects (oscillators
 and rotators) and the radiation filling up the ether: "Even without the existence of radi-

 ating matter, that is, matter heated above absolute zero or somehow excited, empty

 space - or, as we prefer to say, the luminiferous ether - is filled with radiation."62 The

 two were interconnected, as a vibrating electron would constantly exchange energy

 with the zero-point radiation of the ether.

 Yet another difference between the systems of Planck and Nernst was that whereas

 the law of energy conservation was strictly valid for Planck, according to Nernst it

 was only statistically valid, "just like the second law of thermodynamics." For a single

 atom or molecule the energy did not need to be conserved, since the material object

 would exchange energy with the hidden energy pool of empty space. This was a con-

 ception to which Nernst would return a few years later, extending it to the general

 suggestion that all of the laws of nature were of a statistical nature. At this occasion,

 his inaugural lecture as Rector of the University of Berlin given on 15 October 1921,

 he reiterated his idea that an enormous amount of energy was stored in the light ether

 in the form of zero-point energy.63 Nernst's ether was quasi-material, in the sense that

 he imagined it to consist of tiny "molecules," neutral doublets made up of two polar
 particles of "unbelievably small dimensions." This idea of a corpuscular ether was not

 central to his arguments, however. He merely seems to have reused an older idea of

 his, namely, that the ether consists of weightless combinations of positive and negative

 electrons. These hypothetical particles he called "neutrons."64

 An important part of Nernst's hypothesis was that calculations of the zero-point

 energy followed from the ordinary theory of statistical mechanics if only the quantity

 kT were replaced by hv. This implies that for each degree of freedom, where classical

 theory assigns the energy 1 /2 kT the zero-point energy becomes 1 /2 hv. For example,
 the ground state of a one-dimensional oscillator becomes hv and not, as in Planck's

 theory, 1/2/* v.65 He commented: "Every atom, and likewise every conglomerate of

 atoms, which is capable of oscillation at a frequency v per second owing to its mechan-

 ical conditions, will per degree of freedom take up the kinetic energy E - 1 jlhv and

 that even, as already noted, at the absolute zero

 but in accordance with thermodynamics, the zero-point energy is, like every other

 form of energy at absolute zero, free energy."66 In the case of the energy density of

 the zero-point radiation at frequency v, Nernst adopted the formula"

 , 8 7th o

 p(v, , T ) - - 3-v3, o

 which derives from the classical Rayleigh-Jeans law by replacing kT with hv.
 The total energy density integrated over all frequencies in the range from zero to

 63 Nernst (1922, p. 493), with contextual comments in Forman (1971, pp. 84-87). At about the same
 time, Charles G. Darwin, Hendrik Kramers, Bohr, and a few other physicists contemplated the idea that
 strict energy conservation might break down in the interaction between radiation and matter, a view which
 explicitly appeared in the Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory of 1924.

 of his textbook, for example, in the 15th edition of 1926 (pp. 464-465), where he stated that the electrons

 making up the neutrons would become ponderable by taking up zero-point energy. He may have taken the

 idea, as well as the name "neutron," from Sutherland (1 899). Nernst's neutron had only its name in common

 with the neutron that Rutherford introduced in 1920 as a material proton-electron composite particle.

 infinity then becomes infinite. Although Nernst saw "no reason to call such a concep-

 tion impossible," of course he realized that an infinite energy density is unphysical.
 Based on his idea of an atomistic ether, he therefore considered to replace the v3 law

 with the expression:

 , 87 rhv3 v

 p(v, , T) = -

 côv0 exp(v/v0) - 1

 where vo is a constant characteristic of the structure of the ether-vacuum. However,

 given the lack of knowledge of the value of v>o> he chose to return to the v 3 law and

 provide it with a cut-off corresponding to some maximum frequency vm. The result
 becomes

 vm

 p=] -"dv ,

 0

 Nernst assumed vm = 1020 Hz, or Àmin = 3 x 10~10 cm, and with this value, he

 obtained a lower limit for the energy density, namely

 p - 1.52 x 1023 erg/cm3.

 In modern units the quantity of p is equal to 1.52 x 1016 J/cm3 = 1029 MeV/cm3 or,
 by E = mc2, about 150 g/cm3. "The amount of zero-point energy in the vacuum is
 thus quite enormous, making extraordinary fluctuations in it to exert great actions,"
 he wrote.67 Referring to a result obtained by Planck for the energy density of heat
 radiation, Nernst further showed that if a zero-point radiation enclosed in a container

 is compressed, neither its energy density nor its spectral distribution will be affected:

 "Any doubts one might raise to the zero-point radiation owing to radiation pressure or
 resistance to bodies moving through the vacuum are overcome by this truly remark-

 able [gewiss merkwürdige ] result."68 The remarkable result relied on the relationship

 p ~ v3, for which reason Nernst considered it to support his theory. The invariance of

 the energy density would later reappear as a property of the "false vacuum" of inflation

 cosmology and, even later, of dark energy.

 Although Nernst' s cosmophysical speculations were based on an ethereal zero-
 point energy which are of interest in the present context, these ideas played only
 a limited role in his 1916 essay. Its main part was concerned with more mundane

 applications, in particular to chemical reaction rates, equilibrium processes, and the
 structure of the hydrogen molecule. Based on his zero-point version of quantum the-

 ory, he proposed a model of the hydrogen molecule that in some respects differed from
 the Bohr-Debye model generally accepted at that time.69 According to this model,

 the two revolving electrons were placed opposite on a circular orbit perpendicular to
 and between the two hydrogen nuclei. Nernst ascribed to each of the two electrons

 a kinetic theory of 1 /2 hv, where v is the frequency of revolution. Because the elec-

 trons were in equilibrium with the zero-point radiation, they would not radiate, which

 explained the stability of the model without sacrificing the validity of ordinary electro-

 dynamics as postulated by Bohr. For the moment of inertia of the hydrogen molecule,

 Nernst derived J = 3.6 x 10~41 g cm2, which he found was in better agreement with
 measurements than the value used by Debye (which was 1.2 x 10~40 g cm2).

 In a booklet of 1921, entitled Das Weltgebäude im Lichte der neueren Forschung

 and based on a popular lecture he gave in Berlin, Nernst elaborated on the cosmologi-
 cal and astrophysical consequences of his hypothesis. His larger aim was the same, to

 demonstrate that eternal matter-ether recycling prevented the heat death and secured

 a static universe without a beginning or an end: "Our eyes need not, in the far future,
 have to look at the world as a horrible graveyard, but as a continual abundance of

 brightly shining stars which come into existence and disappear."70

 More clearly than earlier Nernst explained that atoms of the chemical elements

 appeared out of the fluctuations of the ether, and that they or their decay products
 would again disappear in the zero-point energy of the ethereal sea. This idea also

 appeared in several of his later studies, where he attempted to develop it into a proper
 theory of astro- and cosmophysics. For example, in his Weltgebäude of 1921 , he con-

 sidered the temperature of cosmic space, as usual identifying empty space with the

 ether. Without providing a value for the very low temperature, he argued that the ether

 must have a small capacity for absorbing heat rays and that this absorption of heat

 would eventually turn up as zero-point energy in the ether. This theme he developed
 in later studies, in 1938 arriving at a cosmic "background temperature" of about 0.75
 K, a result he considered to be "not implausible."71 1 shall, however, not be concerned

 here with Nernst's cosmological views in the 1930s or with his attempt to interpret
 Hubble's law of expansion as a quantum effect in a stationary universe.72

 As Nernst pointed out in his Weltgebäude of 1921, the German physicist Emil

 Wiechert, a pioneer of geophysics and electron theory, had arrived independently at a
 view of the universe that in many ways was similar to his own. Wiechert adhered to the

 ether no less fully than Nernst, and his ether was no less physically active and rich in

 energy. Like Nernst, he speculated that ether-matter transmutations might continually
 take place in the depths of space, and in thus provide a cosmic cycle that would make
 the heat death avoidable. According to Wiechert, material atoms were to be seen as

 extraordinary configurations in the ether, which had to be assigned a content of energy.

 "With regard to the structure of the electron," he wrote, "it follows that the energy den-

 sity of the ether must be considered to be comparable to at least 7 x 1030 erg/cm3

 One gets an impression of the forces that govern the ether when one recalls that the

 pressure which comes into play by keeping together the electric charge in an electron

 is of the order 7 x 1024 atmospheres."73

 Although Wiechert did not follow Nernst in making use of the zero-point energy, or

 otherwise refer to quantum theory, he related the energy of the ether to the cosmolog-

 ical constant appearing in Einstein's field equations of 1917. (Nernst ignored general

 relativity and never mentioned the cosmological constant or Einstein's world model.)

 Although strongly opposed to the theory of relativity, in large measure because it dis-

 posed of his beloved ether, Wiechert suggested that the general theory had in effect
 resurrected the ether and that the cosmological constant (A or À) somehow played
 a role in the resurrection. "My impression is that the À-term does not subordinate

 the ether to matter, but, on the contrary, subordinates matter to ether; for now mat-

 ter appears as precipitations from the ether which here and there are rolled up and

 thereby cause insignificant changes in the constitution of the ether."74 He was not
 more concrete than that.

 Nernst's speculations had some similarity to ideas about the structure and function
 of the classical ether that for a time survived the relativity and quantum revolutions.

 As mentioned in Sect. 2, the physically active ether was a widely accepted component
 of the Victorian worldview, with Oliver Lodge being among the most enthusiastic of

 its protagonists. Lodge shared some of the cosmological views of Nernst, Wiechert
 and Millikan, including that matter particles generated from the potential energy of

 the ether might act counter-entropically and prevent the heat death of the universe.
 He likewise speculated that radioactivity might not only be limited to processes of

 degeneration, but also involve regeneration of matter. Quantum theory had no role

 to play in Lodge's ether, but otherwise it had a great deal in common with Nernst's.
 First and foremost, it was filled with an enormous amount of energy that, although not

 directly detectable, could be calculated. Restating an earlier estimate, in 1920, Lodge
 concluded that "the ether may quite well contain a linear dimension of the order 10~30

 to 10~33 cm, and an energy of 1030 to 1033 ergs per cubic centimeter."75 The energy

 density of Lodge's ether was thus of the same order as the one calculated by Wiechert.
 It corresponds to about 10,000 tons/cm3.

 The ideas that Nernst entertained with regard to ether and zero-point energy seem
 to have been well known in Germany. However, they did not attract much scien-

 tific interest among mainstream physicists, who may not have found his arguments
 for a vacuum zero-point radiation convincing. The general attitude rather may have
 been the one summarized by Siegfried Valentiner, Professor of Physics at the Mining

 Academy in Clausthal: "It is much more difficult to conceive the presence of such a

 74 Wiechert (1921a, p. 69), who was aware of Nernst's ideas. In Wiechert (1921b, p. 186) he referred to
 Nernst (1916).

 75 Lodge (1920, p. 171). The linear dimension of Lodge's ether happened to be of the same order as the
 Planck length (G/i/c3)1/2 = 4 x 10~33 cm or the length scale later appearing in string theory, which is
 about 10~32 cm. In Lodge (1907, p. 493), he illustrated the energy content of the ether more dramatically :

 "This is equivalent to saying that 3 x 10^ 7 kilowatt-hours, or the total output of a million-kilowatt power
 station for 30 million years, exists permanently, and at present inaccessibly, in every cubic millimetre of
 space."

 zero-point energy in the vacuum filled with electrical radiation than it is to assume that

 the existence of the zero-point energy is a peculiarity of the [material] oscillators."76

 The cosmological considerations of Nernst were positively reviewed by Paul Gün-

 ther, a physical chemist and former student of his, and they were disseminated to
 audiences in both Russia and the United States.77 Nernst's use of the cosmic zero-

 point energy as a means to counteract the entropie heat death was occasionally noticed

 in the philosophical and theological debates concerning the end of the world, for exam-

 ple in a doctoral dissertation written by Josef Schnippenkötter, a Jesuit physics teacher

 from Duisburg.78 Fritz Reiche was among the few quantum physicists who referred to

 Nernst's theory, which he did by briefly dealing with the "radical" claim of a zero-point
 radiation filling all of space.79 So did Richard C. Tolman at the California Institute of

 Technology, commenting on the ideas of Keesom, Nernst, and Stern: "This 'nullpunkt

 energie' in the Nernst treatment is in equilibrium with radiant energy in the ether. On

 rise of temperature, energy is drawn not only from the surroundings but also from

 the reservoir of 'nullpunkt energie' and the principle of the conservation of energy
 becomes merely statistically true rather than true for the individual elements of the

 system."80 Worth mentioning finally is that Bohr also was aware of Nernst's idea of
 1916 that energy may not be conserved in an absolute but only statistical sense. In

 an unpublished manuscript of 1917 or 1918, he referred to "an interesting attempt to
 build up a theory on this basis [which] has been made by Nernst."81 He was thus aware

 of Nernst's version of vacuum energy, but chose not to comment on it.

 Apart from occasional references to Nernst's ideas of a vacuum zero-point radi-

 ation in the 1910s and 1920s, his hypothesis was effectively forgotten. Only much
 later, and in particular with the advent of dark energy, did it attract some attention. In a

 non-cosmological context, the hypothesis reappeared in the late 1960s, when Timothy

 Boyer at the University of Maryland proposed a theory of electromagnetic zero-point
 energy that became one of the sources of the research program known as "stochastic
 electrodynamics." As Boyer pointed out in an article of 1969, some features of his

 theory had been anticipated by Nernst more than 50 years earlier.82

 electrodynamics see the research program as a partial alternative to quantum mechanics, in the sense that
 quantum effects are attributed to the classical zero-point field.

 cosmic equilibrium. At that time being the professor of Experimental Physics at the

 University of Hamburg, he was inspired by Arthur Eddington's then recent theory

 of stellar evolution according to which the radiation energy from the stars was the
 result of matter-to-radiation nuclear processes, in the form of either proton-electron

 annihilation or fusion of hydrogen into helium.83 In this context, he referred to the
 possibility of inverse processes in which matter was produced by radiation energy:
 "In order to save the world from the heat death, Nernst once proposed the hypothesis

 that atoms of high atomic number might spontaneously be created by the radiation in

 the cosmos [ Weltraumstrahlung ], to which he ascribed a zero-point energy."84

 Stern considered a hollow space in equilibrium, meaning that the portion of matter

 radiated away in unit time would equal the amount of matter formed from the radia-

 tion. Although he did not explicitly introduce a cosmological perspective, he found it
 "very tempting to assume that cosmic space is in this state of equilibrium."85 Stern's
 universe was a gigantic cavity filled with matter and radiation. Assuming its volume

 V to be fixed and the matter particles of mass m to behave like an ideal gas, he calcu-

 lated the maximum entropy, and in this way, derived an expression for the number of

 particles n per unit volume in equilibrium with blackbody radiation at temperature T :

 N {InmkT)*!2 ( mc2'
 n=v = - p - exp{-w)

 Because of the dominating effect of the exponential term, the concentration of particles

 comes out exceedingly small even at very high equilibrium temperatures. In addition,

 at a given temperature, the number of protons will be much smaller than the number
 of electrons. According to Stern, it would need a temperature of about 100 million

 degrees to support a particle density of one electron per cm3, and for protons, the
 temperature would be nearly 2000 times as great, T = 1011 K. This obviously posed

 a problem, for not only were these temperatures much higher than what Eddington had
 calculated for the interior of stars (and thus implied an almost totally radiation-domi-

 nated universe), but the result was also irreconcilable with the known electro-neutrality

 of matter: electrons and hydrogen nuclei had to be equally abundant, or very nearly so.

 One possible solution was in sight, but one that Stern chose to relegate to a footnote:

 "If any zero-point energy is to be ascribed to the radiation (Nernst) . . . [it] would lower

 the temperatures calculated."86

 Stern's papers triggered some further study on the subject, in particular by Wil-
 helm Lenz and Pascual Jordan in Germany, by Richard Tolman and Fritz Zwicky in
 the United States, and by Seitaro Suzuki in Japan. Of these, I shall pay particular
 attention to Lenz's little-noticed contribution, which was the only one to refer to zero-

 point radiation. Lenz, a former student of Sommerfeld, had done important study in
 atomic and molecular theory and was then professor of Theoretical Physics at the

 83 Eddington (1920), and the authoritative monograph Eddington (1926, pp. 292-317). According to Edd-
 ington, the central temperature of a typical star would not exceed 30 million degrees.

 University of Hamburg, thus a colleague of Stern. His article of 1926 was directly

 inspired by Stern's studies and also mentioned Nernst's hypothesis of a Weltraumst-

 rahlung. Although Stern had not considered thermodynamics in relation to a particular

 cosmological model, Lenz applied similar reasoning to the favored relativistic model
 of the early 1920s - Einstein's closed and matter-filled universe proposed in 1917
 (The other alternative, Willem de Sitter's model, was irrelevant since it contained no

 matter.). In Einstein's model, the radius of the universe R was determined by the total
 mass M according to

 where k is Einstein's gravitational constant ( k = 8 ttG/c2, where G is Newtons's
 constant), which is related to the cosmological constant A, and the average density of

 matter p by Kp = 2 A. The volume of the universe is V = 2n2R 3. The first relation

 means that the radius of the universe grows with its mass, but as Lenz pointed out,

 "the radiation energy does not contribute to the expansion of the world," that is, to the
 increase in J?.87 He considered this to be an argument that weakened the credibility

 of a zero-point radiation in space:

 If one allows waves of the shortest observed wavelengths of À = 2 x 10" 11 cm
 (as in radioactive y-rays)-and if this radiation, converted to material density
 (u/c2 = 106), contributed to the curvature of the world-one would obtain a

 vacuum energy density of such a value that the world would not reach even to
 the moon.88

 Thus, the radius is changeable and only determined if there is a definite equilibrium
 between radiation and matter energy. This implied that the conditions underlying
 Stern's calculations had to be changed, and Lenz concluded that, at equilibrium, the

 radiation energy of the Einstein world must be equal to its matter energy. By means

 of the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law, he found that the temperature of the radiation
 would depend on the world radius as

 Lenz showed that if a particle of mass m is created out of radiation, the radius and
 volume of the universe would increase by the quantities:

 m m

 8R = R- and 8R = 3V - .

 T2 = 1

 where a is the constant in the Stefan-Boltzmann law pra d = aT4. Expressing R in

 radiation energy in his calculations because of "the well-known uncertainties regard-

 ing this assumption." Arbitrarily assuming the radiation temperature to be 1 K, he was

 led to suggest a world radius of the order 1031 cm. Alternatively one might estimate

 the temperature from the radius, as given by the Einstein relation R2 = 2 /icp. Taking

 from de Sitter the average density of matter in the universe to be p ~ 10_26g/cm3,
 or R = 1026cm, Lenz arrived at the much too high space temperature 300 K. As to

 the question of electro-neutrality that protons and electrons must be formed in equal
 numbers, he argued to have solved Stern's problem: "It makes no difference whether

 an electron or a hydrogen nucleus is formed, or whether they radiate away."

 The studies by Stern and Lenz were reconsidered by Tolman at the California Insti-

 tute of Technology, who in 1928 criticized some of Lenz's assumptions and derived

 formulae approximately agreeing with Stern's.89 In a slightly later article Zwicky, then
 Tolman's colleague in Pasadena, also took up the equilibrium approach pioneered by

 Stern. Zwicky concluded that Tolman's modification of Lenz's theory was "in clashing
 contradiction with the actual facts."90 As mentioned, neither Tolman nor Zwicky con-

 sidered the effect of a zero-point energy. In an article of 1927, Pascual Jordan, then at

 the University of Göttingen, also developed the approach followed by Stern and Lenz.

 Applying the new forms of quantum statistics (Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac) to
 the case where the total number of particles varies, he re-derived Stern's equilibrium

 formula. As a possible mechanism for matter-energy transformation in cosmic space,

 Jordan mentioned proton-electron collisions of the kind

 p+ + 2e~ -* e~ + y,

 which had recently been proposed by two physicists in America.91

 Stern presumably discussed the question of the gravitational effect of zero-point

 energy with Lenz in Hamburg, and we know that he discussed it with Pauli, who was
 in Hamburg between 1923 and 1928. As mentioned by Stern in his letter quoted in
 Sect. 3, for a period of time Pauli opposed the concept of zero-point energy, and he

 continued to deny the reality of such an energy in free space. According to the recol-
 lection of Pauli's two last assistants, Charles Enz and Armin Thellung, Pauli made an

 estimate of the gravitational effect of the zero-point radiation along the line of Nernst
 but with a cut-off of the classical electron radius Àmin = e2 /mc2 = 10" 13 cm. He
 is said to have come to the conclusion that the radius of the Einstein universe would

 then "not even reach to the moon."92 A recalculation made by Norbert Straumann,
 who followed some of the last lectures of Pauli, results in a world radius of 31 km,

 that Lenz and Jordan discussed the problem of radiation in space during this period.

 e.g., Rugh and Zinkernagel (2002). Pauli told the story to Enz and Thellung, and also to Stern around 1950,
 but it is unclear when he made the calculation.

 definitely confirming Pauli's estimate.93 Interestingly, the conclusion reported by Enz

 and Thellung is literally the same as given by Lenz in his 1926 article, which might
 indicate that Pauli had discussed the issue with Lenz (which would have been natural)

 or at least that he was familiar with and many years later recalled Lenz's article.

 Within the context of the new Göttingen quantum mechanics, the first attempt to

 quantize the electromagnetic field was made by Pascual Jordan in the important Dre-

 imännerarbeit of the fall of 1925, a study written jointly with Born and Heisenberg.
 Analyzing the field inside a cavity into a set of harmonic oscillators, Jordan assumed

 that in addition to what he called the "thermal energy" of the oscillators, there also

 had to exist a zero-point energy 1 /2A£ v*, where k denotes the degrees of freedom.94

 In this way, he was able to derive the fluctuation formula for blackbody radiation that
 Einstein had derived by statistical methods in 1909.

 However, Jordan did not think of the field zero-point energy as physically real,

 because of the infinite energy that would result from the infinitely many degrees of

 freedom of the field. "It is just a quantity in the calculation having no direct physical
 meaning," he wrote to Einstein at the end of 1925. "One can define physically only
 the thermal energy in the case of T = 0."95 Einstein agreed, as he made clear in a
 letter to Ehrenfest a few months later:

 I have continued to concern myself very much with the Heisenberg-Born scheme.

 More and more I tend to the opinion that the idea, in spite of all the admiration for

 it, is wrong. A zero-point energy of cavity radiation should not exist. I believe
 that Heisenberg, Born and Jordan's argument in favour of it (fluctuations) is
 feeble.96

 As to the infinity associated with the zero-point energy, Jordan soon found a way to
 get rid of it, namely by a substitution procedure that has been called "the first infinite

 subtraction, or renormalization, in quantum field theory."97 The unphysical nature of

 the zero-point energy of space was spelled out in an article he wrote jointly with Pauli
 that appeared in early 1928:

 Contrary to the eigen-oscillations in a crystal lattice (where theoretical as well

 as empirical reasons speak to the presence of a zero-point energy), for the eigen-

 oscillations of the radiation no physical reality is associated with this "zero-point

 energy" of 1/2 hv per degree of freedom. We are here dealing with strictly har-
 monic oscillators, and since this "zero-point energy" can neither be absorbed nor

 reflected - and that includes its energy or mass - it seems to escape any possibility

 93 Straumann (2009) says he checked the calculation while a student in Zurich after having heard about
 the problem from Enz and Thellung. Neither Enz, Thellung, Straumann nor other authors commenting on
 the story seem to be aware of Lenz's article. This article contains no mention of Pauli, and there is also no

 indication of the problem in Pauli's scientific correspondence from the 1920s (Pauli 1979).

 for detection. For this reason it is probably simpler and more satisfying to assume

 that for electromagnetic fields this zero-point radiation does not exist at all.98

 In a review article of the same year on the light-quantum hypothesis, Jordan reiterated

 that he did not believe in a vacuum zero-point energy. Characterizing the quantity as
 a "blemish" (Schönheitsfehler), he emphasized that it should be regarded "more as a
 formal complication than a real difficulty."99

 A few years later, in an influential review of wave mechanics in the Handbuch

 der Physik , Pauli restated his and Jordan's belief that the zero-point energy could be

 ascribed to material systems only and not to the free electromagnetic field. It would,

 Pauli wrote, "give rise to an infinitely large energy per unit volume . . . [and] be unob-

 servable in principle since it is neither emitted, absorbed nor scattered, hence it cannot

 be enclosed inside walls; and, as is evident from experience, it also does not produce
 a gravitational field."100 In agreement with this view, in his Handbuch article, Pauli

 wrote the expression for the energy density in such a way that the zero-point energy
 disappeared. Although Pauli did not refer to Nernst, and may not have read the lat-
 ter's lengthy article of 1916, implicitly his arguments were a refutation of Nernst's

 dynamically active zero-point energy ether. However, Pauli disregarded the creation
 of matter particles out of vacuum or ether fluctuations, which was a crucial point in
 Nernst's hypothesis and which also appeared in Lenz's study of 1926. If the vacuum
 field produces matter, it is no longer gravitationally inert.

 Apart from the proposals of Nernst and Lenz, the zero-point energy of quantum

 theory first appeared in a cosmological context in a note of 1930 by the American
 physicists Edward Condon at the University of Minnesota and Julian Mack at the
 University of Wisconsin. They phrased the problem in a manner that Nernst might

 have approved of:

 According to quantum mechanics, a harmonic oscillator of frequency v has a

 lowest energy state the energy of which is 1 /2hv. When the electromagnetic field

 is treated ... as an assemblage of independent harmonic oscillators, one of which
 is associated with each of the normal modes of vibration of the ether, this leads

 to the result that there is present in all space an infinite positive energy density.

 It is infinite because there is supposed to be no upper limit to the frequencies of

 possible normal modes.101

 The two physicists conjectured that the infinite energy density of space might just
 cancel the infinite negative energy density postulated by Paul Dirac in his new and
 controversial theory of the electron. According to Dirac, the infinite sea of negative
 energy states was itself unobservable, but vacancies in it would appear as protons (or,

 in his later interpretation, as positive electrons).102 Condon and Mack admitted that

 their "cosmological conjecture" was a speculation rather than a scientific theory. At

 any rate, neither they nor other physicists developed it further.

 6 Steps toward dark energy

 Classical ethers of the type assumed by Nernst and Wiechert were not the only ethers

 in the years around 1920. Surprisingly, on the face of it, Einstein began to speak of

 physical space, as described by the metrical tensor gßV in his general theory of relativ-

 ity, as an "ether." In an address in Leiden in 1920, he stressed that "empty space" is not

 empty in the sense of having no physical properties. Quite the contrary, for space was

 indistinguishable from the gravitational field, it might be thought of as a non-absolute
 ether:

 According to the general theory of relativity, space is endowed with physical

 qualities; in this sense, therefore, there exists an ether. According to the general

 theory of relativity, space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there

 not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility of existence

 for standards of space and time (measuring-rods and clocks), nor therefore any
 space-time intervals in the physical sense.103

 Einstein was convinced that the concepts of space and ether had merged, and that the

 space-ether was primary relative to both matter and electromagnetic fields. Space, he
 said in a lecture at the University of Nottingham of 1930, "has in the last few decades

 swallowed ether and time and also seems about to swallow the field and the corpuscles,

 so that it remains the sole medium of reality."104 Although quite differently justified,

 Einstein's ether had the feature in common with Nernst's version that it was physically

 active - indeed the source of entire physical activity. However, Einstein never spoke
 of its activity as derived from a vacuum energy, as Nernst did, and he also did not

 relate its physical activity to the cosmological constant, as later physicists would do.

 Suggestions of a connection between vacuum energy and the cosmological con-

 stant were absent until the 1930s, although a few physicists, among them Einstein and

 Hermann Weyl, considered the physical meaning of the constant. Einstein justified his

 introduction of the cosmological term A g ^ not only as a means of keeping the universe

 in a static state, but also as a means of avoiding a cosmic negative pressure - for "expe-

 rience teaches us that the energy density does not become negative." 105 Nearly 30 years

 later, he elaborated: "The objection to this solution [the spatially finite, uniform world

 model] is that one has to introduce a negative pressure, for which there exists no phys-
 ical justification. In order to make that solution possible I originally introduced a new

 only R = 10' light years.

 member into the field equation instead of the above mentioned pressure."106 It follows

 from the cosmological field equations, including a pressure term p, that

 Without a cosmological constant, this gives R 2 = (- /c/?)_1, which, in order to be
 positive, requires p < 0. If the matter pressure is zero and A > 0, as Einstein origi-
 nally assumed, then the result is instead R2 = 1 /A .

 In an article of 1919, in which he first expressed dissatisfaction with the cosmolog-

 ical constant - said to be "greatly detrimental to the formal beauty of the theory" -
 Einstein reconsidered the connection between the constant and a negative pressure.107
 However, the context was not cosmological, but an attempt at unification, namely,

 to provide a link between gravitation theory and the structure of electrical particles.
 Einstein considered an extended charged particle in the interior of which there was a

 negative pressure (/?o - R), where R is the curvature scalar and Ro its smaller value
 outside the particle. The negative pressure - a modernized version of the so-called
 Poincaré stress in classical electron theory108 - was assumed to maintain the elec-
 tromagnetic force in equilibrium. In regions where only electrical and gravitational

 forces were present, Einstein found that the cosmological constant could be expressed

 by the curvature as 4 A = R. He was at that time aware that the cosmological constant
 can be replaced formally by a negative pressure p = - A/k , but without consider-
 ing it important. Schrödinger had in 1918 suggested to change the expression for the

 energy-stress tensor TßV in a way that corresponded to an elimination of the cosmo-
 logical term, and in a critical response Einstein pointed out that the proposal might be
 equivalent to introducing a negative pressure proportional to the cosmological con-
 stant.109 However, neither Schrödinger nor Einstein entertained explicitly the idea of

 a vacuum energy with a corresponding negative pressure.

 That idea only came much later, although there were no particular reasons for the

 "delay." The interpretation of the cosmological constant as an effective vacuum energy

 density could have been made as early as 1917. Einstein wrote the cosmological field
 equations with the A- term as belonging to the space part of the equations, but if
 arranged as

 Rßv ~~ 2 8ßvR = ~xTßV + AgßV,

 they then appear in a form with the cosmological term equivalent to a contribution to

 the energy-stress tensor TßV. The contribution can be interpreted to imply a vacuum

 108 Poincaré introduced in 1906 a non-electromagnetic, negative pressure acting only on the inside of the

 electron, where it balanced the repulsive electromagnetic forces tending to make the electron explode. The

 energy density pv associated with A and a corresponding negative pressure density
 proportional to the energy density. This appears even more clearly from the Fried-
 mann equations, although these date from 1922, and became generally known only
 after 1930. 110 From these equations, written with both the cosmological constant and

 a pressure term, it follows directly that

 In the parlance of later cosmologists, and with c = 1 , the equation of state of the
 cosmological constant is given by the dimensionless parameter w = p/ p = -1. (For
 ordinary matter, w = 0, and w = 1/3 for radiation). The energy density pv can be
 translated into a corresponding vacuum matter density as pv/c2 = A/StvG. In terms

 of the critical density introduced by Einstein and de Sitter in 1932, it is given by

 When the vacuum expands, the work done to expand it from volume V to V + d V is
 negative, namely, pdV = -pc2dV. In spite of the expansion, the energy density of
 the vacuum remains constant (while the energy increases). By the early 1930s it was

 well known that the effect of A is equivalent to a negative pressure, which appears in

 some of the early reviews of the theory of the expanding universe. 1 1 1 The A -energy is

 sometimes described as a form of "anti-gravity," which is because the force of gravity,
 in the theory of general relativity, is determined by the combination p + 3 p/c2. The
 pressure term can usually be neglected, but in the case of the vacuum, we have

 negative pressure was also considered in Maneff (1932).

 require a positive cosmological constant - there are expanding models with A = 0,

 he believed that the constant was in fact responsible for the expansion of space. "What

 is it then that causes the expansion?" he asked in a popular article of 193 1 . His answer
 was that "the lambda does it":

 Preludes to dark energy 229

 It is the presence of lambda , the "cosmological constant" of Einstein, in the
 equations that not only closes up the universe, . . . but also provides the possi-
 bility of its changing its size. Why it expands and does not shrink, we do not
 know. . . . The expansion depends on the lambda alone. To some it may sound
 unsatisfactory that we are not able to point out the mechanism by which the
 lambda contrives to do it. But there it is, we cannot go beyond the mathematical

 equations, and ... the behavior of lambda is not more strange or mysterious than

 that of the constant of gravitation kappa , to say nothing of the quantum-constant

 h, or the velocity of light c.112

 The equations given above, relating the energy and pressure to the cosmological con-
 stant, were only explicitly stated in 1933, when the Belgian pioneer cosmologist (and

 father of the Big Bang) Georges Lemaître spent a period as guest professor at the Cath-
 olic University of America in Washington, D.C. In a talk given to the U.S. National
 Academy of Sciences on November 20, 1933, he began by noting that, with a mean
 density of matter p = 10-30 g/cm3, "If all the atoms of the stars were equally distrib-

 uted through space there would be about one atom per cubic yard, or the total energy

 would be that of an equilibrium radiation at the temperature of liquid hydrogen," that

 is, T = 20 K.1 13 A few lines later, he offered the following interpretation:

 Everything happens as though the energy in vacuo would be different from
 zero. In order that absolute motion, i.e., motion relative to vacuum, may not be

 detected, we must associate a pressure p = - p c2 to the density of energy p c2
 of vacuum. This is essentially the meaning of the cosmical constant À which
 corresponds to a negative density of vacuum according to po = kc2 /An G =

 10~27 g/cm3. 114

 The negative density (and positive pressure) was not a slip of the pen, as we learn

 from a slightly later article, where Lemaître said that the cosmological constant "may
 be regarded as equivalent to a density, of negative sign, and . . . accompanied with a

 positive pressure."115 While Lemaître thus offered a physical interpretation of the cos-

 mological constant as a vacuum energy density, he did not connect his interpretation

 with the zero-point energy of space or otherwise relate it to quantum physics. That a

 connection of this kind might exist seems to have been vaguely suspected by Weyl,

 who in a letter to Einstein of 1927 wrote: "All the properties that I had so far attributed

 to matter by means of A are now to be taken over by quantum mechanics."116 Alas,
 he did not elaborate.

 Lemaître remained faithful to the cosmological constant as a vacuum energy

 throughout his life. In part inspired by Eddington, according to whom the "cosmi-

 cal constant" was a manifestation of the quantum nature of the universe, he returned a

 few times to the subject, yet without attempting to clarify the quantum connection and

 without endorsing Eddington's unorthodox theory of cosmophysics.117 For example,
 in an address given to the 1958 Solvay Conference, the theme of which was astro-

 physics and cosmology, Lemaître stated that, "If some extension of relativity towards

 a broader field, such as quantum theory, has to be achieved the superfluous À term shall

 be very much welcomed." But instead of following up the idea, he merely remarked:
 "In the meantime, there is nothing to do than to use the cosmical term in astronomical
 applications."118

 Lemaître's insight attracted little attention and failed to inspire new studies related

 to the strange form of vacuum energy and negative pressure. There seems to have been

 1 13 Lemaître (1934a, p. 12). Luminet (2007) calls this "a first intuition of a cosmic microwave background
 as a fossil radiation from the primeval atom," which is a misinterpretation. Lemaître did believe in a fossil

 radiation from the Big Bang, but he erroneously identified it with the cosmic rays.

 114 Lemaître (1934a, p. 12). Notice that Lemaître's denominator was An G rather than SjtG. Also, as
 noted by Earman (2001), he took A > 0 to correspond to a negative p, which may have been owing to
 contemporary confusion about the sign conventions.

 1 15 Lemaître (1934b). See also Lemaître (1949), where he calls p$ the "cosmological density" and stresses
 that the effect of the cosmological constant is to replace p by (p - pq).

 pressure are reckoned, see Eddington (1936, pp. 188, 195, 258) and Earman (2001).

 118 Lemaître (1958, pp. 15-16). As pointed out in Rugh and Zinkernagel (2002), Lemaître probably was
 aware of the vacuum energy arising in quantum field theory at the time he gave his talk to the National
 Academy of Sciences.

 no mention of it through the 1930s and 1940s, possibly because cosmologists found

 Lemaître's interpretation unsurprising and because the cosmological constant was not
 considered the business of quantum theorists interested in the vacuum.1 19

 The young Russian physicist Matvei Bronstein was among the few who (indepen-

 dently of Lemaître) entertained the idea of the cosmological constant as a form of
 cosmic energy. In an article of 1933, he suggested that energy might be transferred
 between ordinary matter and the matter represented by the cosmological constant.120

 In modern parlance, the dark A -matter might decay. Bronstein was the first to suggest

 a time-varying constant A = A(t), which he did "merely for the sake of generality."
 He considered the monotonie variation of A to be an arrow of time in the sense that A

 would always decrease and thereby explain why the universe is expanding rather than

 contracting. Moreover, the decreasing A implied a violation of energy conservation,
 since the energy-conserving equation dE + pdV = 0 would not hold on a cosmic
 scale. Instead of energy conservation, he obtained

 d E dV i r2c2R3 dA

 -

 d t d t k d t

 Bronstein justified his ideas by Bohr's contemporary ideas of energy nonconserva-
 tion in nuclear and stellar physics, which made him suggest that the generation of

 radiant energy from the nuclei of stars did not satisfy the law of energy conservation.

 This radiant energy, he wrote at the end of his article, is "formally equivalent to the

 introduction of a new form of energy connected with the X-field which compensates
 Bohr's nonconservation."121 Because Bronstein's A was evolving, he is sometimes

 mentioned as a precursor of "quintessence," a hypothetical form of dark energy that
 was introduced in 1998 as an alternative to the cosmological constant and that can

 vary in space and time. The equation of state for quintessence is -1 < w < 0.

 It is outside the scope of the present article to discuss in detail the later devel-
 opment, but a few comments relating to the 1950s and 1960s may be appropriate.
 Thus, Lemaître's negative cosmic pressure reappeared in the context of the version of

 steady-state theory proposed by William McCrea in the early 1950s. As an alternative
 to Fred Hoyle's "creation field," McCrea introduced a negative and non-observable
 negative pressure of the form p = - pc2. He described this hypothetical pressure
 as a "zero-point stress" responsible for the creation of new matter in the expanding
 universe:

 119 According to the Web of Science database, Lemaître's 1934 article has (until November 2011) been
 cited only 23 times, with 16 of the citations belonging to the period 1999-201 1. The late attention to his
 study undoubtedly reflects the recent interest in dark energy. The Web of Science only mentions a single
 citing article in the 1930s, and this article, by George Gamow and Edward Teller, does not refer to the
 cosmological constant as a vacuum energy. It should be mentioned that the Web of Science is notoriously
 unreliable with respect to the older literature.

 Gorelik and Frenkel (1994).

 121 Bronstein (1933, p. 82). Bronstein referred to Bohr (1932), where Bohr briefly suggested that energy
 conservation was violated in the interior of the stars. In fact, the suggestion was made several years earlier

 by Kramers, who in the semipopular book Kramers and Hoist (1925, p. 140) argued that energy might be
 spontaneously generated in hot stars.

 According to relativity theory, the creation process must follow from the exis-

 tence of a zero-point stress in space. Now the current quantum theory of fields
 endows space with several "virtual" zero-point properties. If any of these can
 be interpreted as producing a stress, it appears that the connexion might be
 established. (Such a treatment would require an examination of zero-point energy
 as well.)122

 232 H. Kragh

 McCrea did not refer to either Lemaître's 1934 article or the cosmological constant,

 although within his theory, there was a formal similarity between the postulated cos-
 mic stress and the cosmological constant. Nor did he, or other cosmologists at the
 time, mention the "Casimir effect" predicted on theoretical grounds in 1948 by the

 Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir, a former student of Ehrenfest and assistant of Bohr
 and Pauli and then the co-director of the research laboratory of the Philips Company in

 Eindhoven, Holland. The Casimir effect is today generally understood as demonstrat-

 ing the energy and negative pressure of empty space owing to its zero-point energy, but

 for more than two decades, the effect attracted little attention in quantum field theory

 and none in cosmology.123 Inspired by McCrea's idea, the Polish physicist Jaroslav

 Pachner proposed in 1965 a cyclic model of the universe in which the singularity at
 the bounces ( R = 0) was avoided by the building up of a negative vacuum pressure

 varying with the curvature of space. Since then, negative pressure has been a standard

 ingredient in cosmologies of the cyclic or bouncing type.124

 The connection to the quantum mechanics of the vacuum that McCrea had vaguely

 anticipated was made explicit in studies of 1965-1968 primarily by the Russian physi-
 cists Erast Gliner and Yakov Zel'dovich. Gliner, who worked at the Physico-Technical
 Institute in what was then Leningrad, seems to have been the first to suggest that the

 universe might have begun its expansion in a vacuum-like state, an idea which eventu-

 ally was developed into the inflationary scenario.125 He called the hypothetical form
 of vacuum-like matter a "/x-vacuum" and ascribed to it a negative pressure. Gliner

 argued that the hypothesis of a negative-pressure vacuum was not "utterly unrealistic"

 because attempts to describe the structure of elementary particles "would lead to the

 conclusion that inside the particle there must be a negative pressure which balances

 the electrostatic repulsion."126 Probably without knowing it, his remark connected to

 Einstein's theory of 1919 and the even earlier idea of Poincaré concerning the structure
 of the electron.

 122 McCrea ( 1 95 1 , pp. 573-574). On McCrea's theory and its relationship to the ordinary theory of general
 relativity, see Kragh (1999).

 123 For a critical discussion of the Casimir effect, see Rugh et al. (1999). McCrea (1986) discussed the
 Casimir effect and its relation to the cosmological "substratum radiation" in his Milne Lecture of 1985.

 124 Pachner (1965) and Kragh (2009).

 125 The studies of Gliner, Zel'dovich and other Russian theorists anticipated the early theories that led to
 the inflation scenario (due to Alexei Starobinsky and Allan Guth) and turned the vacuum energy into a
 concept of particular relevance for the very early universe. For this connection, see Smeenk (2005).

 126 Gliner (1966, p. 381) published in Russian 1965. Gliner seems to have been unaware of the electron
 model suggested by Casimir in 1953 and in which the Poincaré stress was explained as an effect of the
 zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field. On this model, see Carazza and Guidetti (1986).

 Preludes to dark energy 233

 Interpreting the vacuum energy of empty space as the result of quantum fluctuations

 in the zero-energy field, in articles of 1967 and 1968, Zel'dovich, at the Institute of

 Applied Mathematics in Moscow, pointed out that "we can speak of an energy density

 of the vacuum and a pressure (stress tensor) of the vacuum."127 Moreover, by assum-

 ing a cut-off corresponding to the mass of a proton, he derived a zero-point energy
 pv of the order 1017g/cm3, noting that it much exceeded the observational bound
 on the cosmological constant. This was the beginning of the "cosmological constant
 problem," namely, that the cosmological constant as calculated from the zero-point

 energy density of the vacuum Aq ft is hugely larger than bounds imposed by observa-
 tion. Zel'dovich compared the calculated tIqft = 10" 10 cm-2 with the observational
 limit Aobs < 10-54 cm-2. Although considering the first value to have "nothing in

 common with reality," he nonetheless suggested that the cosmological constant might

 arise from the vacuum of quantum field theory. In fact, the discrepancy between the
 two versions of the cosmological constant soon turned out to be much larger than
 Zel'dovich estimated.

 7 Conclusion

 Apart from reviewing the early theory of zero-point energy and its historical links to

 half-integral quantum numbers, I have drawn attention to the first attempts of apply-

 ing ideas of quantum theory to cosmic space. In this respect, Nernst's theory of 1916

 should be counted as a pioneering study, and that despite its being of speculative nature

 and basic assumption of an ether filling up the universe. However, Nernst's ideas were

 out of tune with mainstream physics and for this reason alone exerted little influence

 on the further development. In later studies, at least indirectly inspired by Nernst, the

 Hamburg physicists Stern and Lenz investigated the equilibrium of matter and radi-
 ation in the universe, which made Lenz estimate the temperature of space according
 to Einstein's model of a closed universe. Lenz's article of 1926 is little known and

 has been ignored by most historians of physics and cosmology. It deserves a better
 treatment.

 With the exception of Nernst, the zero-point energy of free space was an unwel-

 come concept that found no place in quantum physics until the 1930s. Moreover, it also
 remained isolated from the vacuum energy associated with the cosmological constant

 after 1934, when Lemaître clearly formulated the connection between vacuum energy,

 negative vacuum pressure, and the cosmological constant. His insight, which did not
 rely specifically on the expanding universe, could have been stated many years earlier.
 However, it was not, and when it was it attracted no interest. Although the cosmo-

 logical constant is mathematically equivalent to the gravitational effects of vacuum
 energy, conceptually the two quantities are entirely different: while the former is a

 property of space, the latter is a quantum effect. It was only after the establishment of
 modern Big Bang theory in the mid-1960s that Zel'dovich thought of integrating the
 quantum-mechanical zero-point energy with the vacuum energy of the cosmological

 127 Zel'dovich (1968, p. 382). This article has been republished, with an editorial introduction by Varun
 Sahni and Andrzej Krasinski, in General Relativity and Gravitation 40 (2008): 1557-1591.

 constant, thereby starting a line of development that would lead to the famous cosmo-
 logical constant problem and give the vacuum energy a central role in cosmological
 research.

 Vacuum energy in the form of the cosmological constant appeared as a crucial ele-

 ment in the inflation scenarios of the early 1980s, but was limited to the very early
 universe. Lemaître's version of vacuum energy, however, had an effect that became
 relatively more important as the expansion proceeds, and in this sense, it was closer to

 the dark energy of modern cosmology. Although dark energy came as an observational
 surprise in the late 1990s, it was not a complete surprise. A few cosmologists, and
 perhaps first Hans-Joachim Blome and Wolfgang Priester in Germany, realized in the

 1 980s that the universe might be in a state dominated by vacuum energy and has been

 so for several billion years (Fig. 4). 128

 128 Blome and Priester (1984) who not only referred to the studies of Gliner and Zel'dovich, but also to
 McCrea (1951) Einstein (1920). However, they seem to have been unaware of Nernst's early anticipation
 of dark energy. Blome and Priester (1985) concluded in favor of a vacuum energy of pvc 2 = Ac^/SnG «
 10~8 erg/cm3. On Priester's studies in cosmology, including his fascination of the cosmological constant,
 see Overduin et al. (2007).
