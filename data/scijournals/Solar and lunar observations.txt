 Abstract From the early ninth century until about eight centuries later, the Middle

 East witnessed a series of both simple and systematic astronomical observations for

 the purpose of testing contemporary astronomical tables and deriving the fundamental

 solar, lunar, and planetary parameters. Of them, the extensive observations of lunar

 eclipses available before 1000 AD for testing the ephemeredes computed from the

 astronomical tables are in a relatively sharp contrast to the twelve lunar observations

 that are pertained to the four extant accounts of the measurements of the basic para

 meters of Ptolemaic lunar model. The last of them are Taqï al-Dïn Muhammad b.

 Ma'rûf s (1526-1585) trio of lunar eclipses observed from Istanbul, Cairo, and Thes

 salonica in 1576-1577 and documented in chapter 2 of book 5 of his famous work,

 Sidrat muntaha al-afkarfimalakût al-falak al-dawwâr (The Lotus Tree in the Seventh

 Heaven of Reflection). In this article, we provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy
 of his solar (1577-1579) and lunar observations.

 1 Introduction

 Generally speaking, astronomical observations in the medieval period were made for

 one of the two purposes:

 (1) Testing contemporaneous astronomical tables and ephemeris. Some instances of

 such tests contain interesting cases of reconciling theory and observations.1

 (2) The derivation of the fundamental parameters of astronomical theories, most

 notably the solar, lunar, and planetary orbital elements.

 In the early Islamic period, the observation of heavenly phenomena such as plane

 tary conjunctions and solar and lunar eclipses was directed at testing the accuracy of

 contemporary astronomical tables, the so-called zîjes.2 The most extensive collection

 of such observations are reported in Ibn Yunus's Hâkimt zïj (d. 1009). For example,

 from the observation of the conjunction of Jupiter with Regulus on 6 September 864,

 Habash al-Hàsib (d. after 869) found that the mean longitude of the planet as computed

 from the tables of the mean motions in the Mumtahan zïj (complied at Baghdad about

 830 under the observational programme ordered by the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun,

 who reigned 813-833) should be decreased by 0;47°.3 Also, from the observation of

 the conjunction between Venus and Mars on 22 October 864, he argued that the mean

 anomaly of Venus as computed from that zïj should increase to 4;30° and the mean

 anomaly of Mars should be reduced by 0;30°.4 Abu al-Rayhân al-Bïrûnï's works (973

 1048), most notably his al-Qânûn al-mas 'Udl, are an important source for Islamic solar

 and lunar observations other than eclipses. For instance, he gathers and discusses in
 detail nearly all of the solar observations made by his Islamic predecessors for the

 determination of the orbital elements of the sun (eccentricity and direction of the apsi

 dal line)5 and of the obliquity of the ecliptic. He also informs us of the Banu Musâ's

 1 The two interesting cases are Shams al-Dïn Muhammad al-Wâbkanawï's (12547-after 1316) test of the

 times and longitudes computed from the Ilkhânî zfj for four conjunctions of Jupiter with Saturn in 1286
 and 1305-1306 against observations and his observation of the annular eclipse of 30 January 1283 (see
 Mozaffari 2009, 2013a, b, pp. 239-240; about the curious situation of annular solar eclipses in the medieval
 astronomy, especially see Mozaffari 2014b. The Ilkhânî zîj is the formal product of the early period of the
 activities in the Maragha observatory, northwestern Iran, c. 1259-1271, under the directorship of Naslr
 al-Dïn al-Tusî (1201-1274); about it, see Kennedy 1956, pp. 161-2 and Samsô et al. 2001, p. 46) and
 Abraham Zacut's observation of the occultation of Venus by the Moon on 24 July 1476 (see Goldstein and
 Chabâs 1999). For the previous studies about the role observation and its relation to theory in the medieval

 astronomy, see, e.g., Hartner (1977), Goldstein (1985a, 1988), Saliba (1994). For the astronomers referred
 to here, see DSB, NDSB, ΒΕΑ, Ε12, Sezgin (1978), and Rosenfeld and ihsanoglu (2003).

 2 On Islamic astronomical tables, see Kennedy (1956) and Samsô et al. (2001); these two main sources

 of the knowledge of Islamic astronomical tables, the so-called zljes, are followed by a new comprehensive

 survey that is currently prepared by Benno Van Dalen.

 3 Ibn Yûnus, L: pp. 108-109; Caussin de Perceval (1804), p. 155. The date given in the text is "Wednesday,

 30 Rajab 250 Hijra" (= 6 September 864) and "21 Murdàd 238 Yazdigird" which is the equivalent of Monday,

 5 September 869. The year in the latter date is evidently incorrect and should be 233 (on 5 September 869,

 Jupiter and Regulus were over 125° apart).

 4 Ibn Yûnus, pp. 108-109, Caussin de Perceval (1804), pp. 155,157. The date given in the text is "Sunday,
 6 Ramadan 250 H" (= 11 October 864) and "7 Mihr 233 Y" (= 22 October 864). The first date is in error,

 simply because 11 October 864 was a Wednesday. Moreover, in the report it is stated: "Ahmad b. 'Abd-Allâh

 [Habash] said; '[...] at daybreak (tulu al-fajr; i.e. the start of the morning twilight), I saw Venus and Mars

 being close to (associated with) each other (mutalasiqayn) in [the zodiacal sign] Virgo, as if the two were

 one star'"; at the mentioned time on 22 October 864, the two planets were less than 5' apart while 11 days

 earlier they were about 6° apart. Cf. Caussin de Perceval (1804), p. 156.

 5 These are summarized and analysed in Mozaffari (2013c). For the solar meridian altitude observations,

 see Said and Stephenson (1995), Newton (1972) which deals specifically with the solar data recorded by
 Btrûnï.

 observation of the lunar maximum latitude and the value about 4; 45° they deduced,
 which is one of the two non-Ptolemaic values for the inclination of lunar orbit from

 the medieval Islamic period.6

 In the late Islamic period, post-1000 AD, the number of observational reports signif

 icantly decreases, despite the fact that the great Islamic observatories were constructed

 in the same period.7 Muhyï al-Dïn al-Maghribï (d. 1283) gives a summary of his own
 "extensive" observations carried out at the Maragha observatory between 1262 and

 1274.8 A short while later, al-Kawàshï, a thirteenth-century Yemenite scholar, presents

 13 random observations of planetary conjunctions, planetary appulses to stars, and

 occultations that he made in Yemen and Egypt during 1277-1284.9 Nothing is known

 about the details of the observations made at the Samarqand observatory, although it is

 striking that Ulugh Beg's Sultânïzîj, the principal fruit of the astronomical programme

 conducted there, shows the application of a good number of the unprecedented values

 for the solar, lunar, and planetary parameters in addition to the incorporation of the

 now well-known star catalogue into this work.10 Over one century later, Taql al-Dïn

 Muhammad b. Ma'rflf ( 1526-1585) documented the solar and lunar observations made

 6 Bïrunï, al-Qânûn al-mas'ûdï VII.5: (1954-6), vol. 2, p. 779. The other value is 5;3° as observed by Ibn
 Yflnus (see King 1999, pp. 502-503).

 7 About the observatories founded on in the medieval Islamic period, Sayih ([I960] 1988) is still the only

 available study, although some of his argumentations and conclusions should be treated with caution; e.g.

 in the case of the latter period of the Maragha observatory, see some critical remarks in Mozaffari and Zotti
 (2013), pp. 61-62.

 8 About Muhyï al-Dïn, especially see Saliba (1983, 1985, 1986) and Mozaffari (2014a). A monograph
 about his unique contribution to observational and practical astronomy at the Maragha observatory on the

 basis of a thorough analysis of his documented observations in the Talkhïs al-majistï (Compendium of the

 Almagest) is being prepared by one of us (SMM).

 9 See King and Gingerich (1982).

 10 In his detailed commentary on Ulugh Beg's Zïj, 'Alt Qûshèî (d. 1474), one of the contributors of this

 work, says nothing as to the details of the astronomical observations at Samarqand. This source is, of course,

 invaluable for checking the parameter values deduced from the tables in that zïj. Much less emphasis in the

 secondary, modern literature has been put on the parameter values underlying the tables in this work; the

 eccentricity of Venus is a good example: the majority of the early Islamic astronomers including al-Battânî

 and Ibn Yflnus, influenced by Indian astronomy, took the eccentricity of this planet to be equal to that of
 the sun (i.e. the earth). Although some astronomers like Bïrflnï and 'Abd-al-Rahmân al-Khâzinï (β. the
 first half of the twelfth century) kept the Ptolemaic distinction of the eccentricity of Venus from that of the

 sun, this idea did not disappear completely in the Middle Eastern branch of Islamic astronomy until the

 foundation of the Maragha observatory, as it can be traced back in some ztjes until the mid-thirteenth century
 (e.g. in Muntakhab al-DIn al-Yazdî's Manzûm zlj, "Versified zïj" written in Yazd, central Iran, ca. 1252,

 f. 46v). Nevertheless, it can be found prevalently in the Western branch of Islamic astronomy (Spain and

 northwestern Africa) in the latter periods (e.g. in the zïj of Ibn al-Bannâ of Marrakech, d. 1321 ; see Samsô

 and Millâs 1998, pp. 265, n. 19, 266) and was transmitted to the late medieval Latin and Jewish astronomy
 (e.g. cf. Swerdlow 1977, p. 205; Goldstein 1985b, p. 113; Chabâs and Goldstein 1994, p. 33; Goldstein
 and Chabâs 1999, p. 188; Goldstein 2003, pp. 160-161; Chabâs and Goldstein 2003, pp. 253-254; Chabâs
 2004, p. 188; Chabâs and Goldstein 2009, p. 34). By this idea, the double eccentricity of the planet (i.e.

 the distance of the equant point from the earth) remain larger than 2 (the radius of the orbit = 60). But, the

 geocentric eccentricity of Venus approximately remains equal to about 1.74 in the past two millennia. The

 maximum equation of centre of Venus in Ulugh Beg's Zïj (PI: fol. 144r; P2: fol. 161v)isequalto 1;39,19°

 which corresponds to a double eccentricity of 1.73, in agreement with the value 0;52 QflshCi gives for the
 half of it (N: pp. 273-4, PN: f. 241v). An analysis of medieval values for the orbital elements of Venus is
 being prepared by one of us (SMM).

 at the Ottoman territory, most notably in the short-lived observatory at Istanbul before

 its deconstruction, which are the main concern of the present paper. He was not pro

 vided with an opportunity and, more important, facilities to deal with the planets, and

 so his main contribution to observational astronomy was confined to the determination

 of the solar and lunar parameters.

 Let us make another distinction between simple/random and purposed/systematic

 observations. Al-Kawâshï's observations are typical of the first category, while TaqT
 al-Dïn and Muhyï al-Dln's observations fall into the second one, where an astronomer

 explains quantitatively how he has derived his own parameter values from direct obser

 vations, often a problematical task with unexpected difficulties requiring sufficient and

 reasonable justifications, so that other medieval astronomers show little intention to

 do so. Ibn Yûnus, for instance, never explains whether and how he derived his non

 Ptolemaic parameter values from observations, although it cannot be far from the truth

 to assume that his new parameter values are actually based upon the data he gathered

 from his documented observations. For instance, the possibility exists that his non

 Ptolemaic values for the radii of the epicycles of the interior planets11 were the fruit

 of his own observations of these planets.12

 For lunar eclipses, a distinction between random and systematic observations is

 especially relevant. A good number of reports of observations of lunar eclipses survive

 from early Islamic astronomy, especially in Ibn Yunus's Hâkimïzïj. These observations

 have played a pivotal role in the modern estimation of the rate of the deceleration of

 the earth's rotation about its axis (ΔΤ, the difference between terrestrial and universal

 time).13 For a medieval astronomer, lunar eclipses were the only means by which the
 lunar orbital elements in the Ptolemaic model could be determined. In order to measure

 the size of the lunar epicycle, a trio of lunar eclipses is required. Observations of the

 moon at quadratures are necessary for determining the eccentricity.

 Some of the preserved reports that belong to the early Islamic period appear to be

 simple observations that, at best, only fulfil the first purpose posited in the beginning

 of this paper, namely to test available zîjes, and do not show any clear relation to
 the second purpose, i.e. the determination of the parameters of the lunar model:14

 Al-Mâhànï observed a trio of lunar eclipses in 854-6, but only measured the times of

 the beginning of eclipses and/or immersions (i.e. first and second contacts), while for

 11 He has the value 22;52 for the radius of the epicycle of Mercury (Ptolemy: 22;30 in the Almagest

 and 22;15 in the Planetary Hypotheses) and 43;28 for that of Venus (Ptolemy: 43;10) if the radius of the

 geocentric orbit of the epicycle centre, the deferent, is taken as 60 arbitrary units. These values are derived

 from the maximum value for the epicyclic equation of these planets at mean distance as tabulated in Ibn
 Yûnus's ztj, i.e. 22;24° and 46;25°, respectively, for Mercury and Venus (Ibn Yûnus, L: pp. 121,190,192;
 Caussin de Perceval 1804, p. 221).

 12 He observed some conjunctions of the inferior planets with each other (e.g. the morning of 22 June 985;

 modem: the evening of 18 June 985), with stars (e.g. Venus and Regulus: one hour after sunset in Cairo
 on 23 June 990; modem: about 3 h after midnight on 24 June 990), and with the other planets (e.g. Venus

 and Saturn: half an hour before the sunrise in Cairo on 20 January 988; modem: about two hours before

 the sunrise in Cairo on the given date); see Ibn Yflnus, Ztj, L: pp. 113-114; Caussin de Perceval (1804), pp.
 179-184.

 13 The results of the researches by Prof. F. R. Stephenson and his colleagues on medieval Islamic eclipses

 reports are summarized in Stephenson (1997), chapters 12 and 13 and Steele (2000), chapter 4.

 14 What follows is based upon Stephenson (1997), pp. 476-493 and Steele (2000), pp. 107-124.

 the measurement of the radius of the lunar epicycle, it is necessary to determine the

 times of the middle (maximum phase) of lunar eclipses. Ibn al-Amâjûr's observations

 of five lunar eclipses in a decade from 923 to 933 were mainly directed at testing

 Habash's zîj- Al-Battànï describes only two lunar eclipses that he observed in 883

 and 901. By them, he shows the existence of glaring differences in magnitudes and

 timings of the eclipses between what are computed on the basis of the Almagest and

 what are observed. He also employs them to derive the apparent angular diameter of

 the moon at mean distance.15 Nevertheless, from this period, we have three values

 for the radius of the lunar epicycle; the first two are the Banii Mûsâ's 5;22 and Ibn

 al-A'lam's 5;5.16 No lunar eclipse is reported from the Banu Musâ, and their own

 value for the maximum lunar first inequality is mentioned in a later source, namely the

 thirteenth-century Ashrafi zîj, while Bïrûnï has nothing to say about it; nevertheless,
 his clear evidence of the other lunar observational data from the Banu Musâ makes it

 not far from true to accept the validity of this attribution and that their own value for

 the radius of the epicycle was actually an observational achievement. The same can

 also be true of Ibn al-A'lam, from whom a non-Ptolemaic table of the lunar equations

 has survived, though not any observation of a lunar eclipse. The third value is Ibn

 Yunus's 5;1 as derived from a maximum lunar first inequality of 4;48° as tabulated in

 his own zîj· Ibn Yunus observed ten lunar eclipses spread over a period from 979 until

 1002; for half of them, the times of the first and last contact are given either directly
 or with reference to the altitudes of the moon or of some luminous clock stars.

 In the late medieval Islamic period, the situation drastically changed, so that the

 astronomers of this period no longer seem intent on simply presenting the results

 of their own observations of eclipses for the purpose of testing astronomical tables

 against the obtained observational data;17 rather, all the twelve lunar observations we

 15 Nallino ([1899-1907] 1969), vol. 3, p. 87. After this, al-Battânî concentrates on the determination of
 the sun's distance to the earth; see Swerdlow (1972).

 16 The radius of the lunar orbit, the inclined eccentric deferent, is taken as 60 arbitrary units. These two

 values are derived, respectively, from the maximum values given for the first inequality of the moon by
 al-Kamâlîin his Ashrafîzïj, ff. 49rand 229v-230r: 5;8° and4;51°. Muhyï al-Dîn al-Maghribl adopts Ibn
 al-A'lam's lunar equations in his first zïj, Tâj al-azyâj (Crown of the zïjes), compiled in Damascus before
 his joining to the Maragha observatory (see Dorce 2002-3, p. 203; 2003, pp. 127,184).

 17 A main factor appears to be the fair agreement between the computed and observed results, as a good

 number of such accounts scattered in the late Islamic zïjes testify; in them, an astronomer explains his
 computation of the circumstances and parameters of an eclipse and then usually claims that they were in

 agreement with observation, which can easily be checked by aid of modern data. For example, in his 'Alâ Ί

 zïj [preserved in a unique copy in India, Hyderabad, Salar Jung Library, no. H17; see Dalen (2004)] on pp.
 32-35, Farid al-Dîn Abu al-Hasan 'All b. 'Abd al-Karim al-Fahhad of Shirwàn or Baku (both cities now

 in Azerbaijan, the latter north to the first) presents at length his computation of the parameters of a solar

 and a lunar eclipse that were to take place, respectively, in the conjunction and opposition about the month

 Shawwâl of the year 571 H/April-May 1176. For the solar eclipse (which occurred on 11 April 1176), he

 computes the ecliptic longitude at the instant of the apparent conjunction (i.e. the topocentric longitude of

 the sun and moon in the maximum phase of the eclipse) as λ cf = 27; 32°, the time of mid-eclipse as about Τ

 = 4;40h before noon, and its magnitude as 11 ;46 digits (the diameter of the solar disc is taken as 12 digits).

 He then states that he observed this eclipse and found its circumstances in agreement with the computed

 results. It is not precisely known whether the place of observation was Baku or Shirwàn; for the first, the
 modem values are: Xcf - 27;56°, Τ = 8:18 MLT, and magnitude 0.996. For the lunar eclipse (which
 occurred on 25 April 1176), he gives the longitude of the moon at the instant of the mid-eclipse as about
 = 222;31°, Τ = 3;53h after sunset, and magnitude 6;51 digits (the diameter of the lunar disc is taken

 have at our disposal from the period in question pertain to the four extant accounts of

 the lunar measurements surviving from Islamic astronomy. In them, the four Islamic

 astronomers present their observational data of a trio of lunar eclipses and explain how

 they have computed their own values for the radius of the lunar epicycle from them:

 (i) Bîrûnï in al-Qânûn al-mas'ûdî (Mas'ûdïc canons) VII.3: the lunar eclipses of

 1003-1004, observed at Ghazna;18

 (ii) Muhyï al-Dïn al-Maghribï in Talkhïs al-majistî V: the lunar eclipses 7 March

 1262, 7 April 1270, and 24 January 1274, observed from Maragha;19

 (iii) Jamshld Ghiyàth al-Dïn al-Kàshï in the prologue of the Khâqânî zïj■ the lunar

 eclipses of 1406-7 observed in Kâshàn, central Iran;20 and

 (iv) Taqï al-Dïn Muhammad b. Ma'ruf in Sidrat muntaha al-afkarfimalakût al-falak

 al-dawwâr (The Lotus Tree in the Seventh Heaven of Reflection) V.2: the lunar

 eclipses of 1576-1577 observed in Istanbul, Cairo, and Thessalonica.21

 Bîrûnï and Muhyï al-Dïn determined the value 5; 12 for the radius of the lunar

 epicycle; Kâshïreached the figure about 5 ; 17; Taqï al-Dïn derived the value about 5 ;24.

 Of them, only Muhyï al-Dïn and Taqï al-Dïn explain their observations of the moon

 near quadrature for the sake of determination of the lunar eccentricity in Ptolemaic

 model; the first derives the value 9 and the latter a value a bit more than 9;46 (radius

 of orbit = 60).

 The first three trios have already been studied. Here, Taqï al-Dïn's solar and lunar

 observations are presented and analysed. The accuracy of his lunar observations is also

 compared with the precision attained in the three earlier sets of observations of the

 triple lunar eclipses from the late Islamic period as well as in the extensive observations

 of the lunar eclipses from both the late medieval European and early Islamic periods.

 as 12 digits); the modern values are: λ J3 = 221;59°, Τ = 22:34 MLT (sunset: 18:53 MLT), and magnitude
 0.673. In both cases, the computed longitudes are of errors of about 1/2°; the computed magnitude of the

 solar eclipse and the time of the lunar counterpart are of good accuracy. Such accuracies are not entirely
 matters of coincidence, since similar instances can be traced back in medieval Islamic astronomy (a notable

 case may be Wâbkanawî's calculation of the circumstances of the annular solar eclipse of 30 January 1283;

 see note 1 above). Rather, this reflects our lack of knowledge about the quantitative precision of some

 Islamic zljes that were the fruits of undertaking the difficult task of continuous observations and derivations

 of parameters of Ptolemaic models, and the fact that if Ptolemaic models were quantified anew by the

 re-measurement of its fundamental parameters, it would be probable to predict eclipses with precisions

 within an hour, one degree in longitude, and one digit in magnitude. Wâbkanawï replaced al-Fahhàd's

 computations and eclipses by his calculation of the solar eclipses of 5 July 1293 and 28 October 1296 (for

 latitude of Tabriz, northwestern Iran) and the lunar eclipse of 30 May 1295 when he taught al-Fahhàd's
 Zîj to Gregory Chioniades (c. 1240-1320) who translated it into Greek (see Pingree 1985, p. 352f). For

 panying instructions to use them) he composed.22 As usual in this genre of zîjes, in

 the canons, our author presents the variant topics pertaining to the theoretical, math

 ematical, and practical astronomy such as the sections on chronology, trigonometry,

 spherical astronomy, and the methods for the derivation of the fundamental parame

 ters. In the parts related to the sun and moon, detailed accounts of his observations and

 the instruments applied to them are given,23 and then he explains how he has derived

 his own values for the solar and lunar parameters from the date obtained in these obser

 vations. In what follows (Sect. 2.1), we first present Taqï al-Dïn's solar observations

 as translated from the original Arabic text, which are also summarized in Table 1,

 together with a brief commentary upon the accuracy of the unprecedented values he

 achieved for the solar parameters. This is followed by presenting the accounts of his

 four lunar observations in the same way (Sect. 2.2); the fourth observation is investi

 gated there, but his first three lunar observations, i.e. the trio of lunar eclipses, shall be

 analysed at length in Sect. 3. We number his nine observations in the chronological

 order and indicate those of the sun by the prefix S, and of the moon by M. Ml (1576) is

 the earliest documented observation and M4 (1579), the latest. As the contents of this

 work shows, Taqï al-Dïn's observations are limited only to the two luminaries; as he

 definitely says in the account of M4, at that time, he had not yet dealt with the stellar

 observations. He died in 1585 and apparently did not find any opportunity to deal

 with the stars and planets; moreover, as mentioned earlier, in his later zïj, Kharïdat,

 he strangely returns back to Ulugh Beg's values for the solar and lunar parameters.

 Two notes about the dates and a technical astronomical term in the following

 accounts merit consideration: the Alexander's era mentioned in the reports is in fact
 the Seleucid or Byzantine era (1 October -311), to which Ptolemy refers as "accord

 ing to the Chaldaeans"24 ("Two-Horned", i.e. Alexander, in Islamic astronomy), in

 which the years are Julian years of 365 t/4d; although our author repeatedly make use

 of the alternative of "the death of Alexander" for this calendar, it has nothing to do

 with the Philip era which is referred to as "Death of Alexander" (12 November -323)

 throughout the Almagest, and which is used with the Egyptian years of 365d. Also,

 The Hijra date in the first observation of the sun is according to the civil reckoning (the

 epoch 16 July 622), but in the other four solar observations as well as in all of the lunar

 observations, the Hijra dates are according to the astronomical reckoning (the epoch

 15 July 622).25 The terms sâ'ât al-bu'd or daqâ'iq al-bu'd, literally, "hours/minutes

 of the distance", as found in all the passages, refer to the interval of time remaining

 to or passed from the meridian passage/transit of a heavenly body (in the case of the

 sun: true noon) counted in terms of equal hours or minutes.26

 2.1 The solar observations

 [51] We have observed the extremal [noon-altitudes of the sun] at the two solstices in

 the same year. The second [first (?) observation] had been made at true noon (nisf

 nahâr, lit. "middle of daylight/midday") on Tuesday, 24 Rabï' al-Awwal [3] [...]

 in the year 985 of Hijra and [ 11 Hazïrân [9]] 1888 of Alexander's era. After the

 correcting adjustment for making the true altitude and [i.e., deriving the summer

 solstice altitude from the noon-altitude on this solstice day by] considering the

 period/argument {hissa) [between noon and the time of occurring the summer
 solstice], the maximum altitude at the summer solstice was 72;30,8,29°.27

 [52] But, the first [second (?) observation] had been made at true noon on Wednes

 day, the first day {ghurrat) of Shawwâl [10] in the mentioned year [i.e., 985].

 After doing the adjustments, the extremal altitude at the winter solstice was
 25;32,20,14°.28

 From Taqï al-Dïn's above statements as well as the precision to which the two

 values just mentioned are given, it is evidently understood that they are the product of

 some kind of adjustment. In fact, the solar noon-altitudes in the solstitial days can be

 representative of the sun's extremal meridian-altitudes, if and only if the solstices take

 place exactly at true noon. Otherwise, medieval astronomers undertook some methods

 for extrapolating the extreme solstitial noon-altitudes. Taqï al-Dïn does not explain his
 adopted method in order to do this, but the practical procedures for such adjustments

 can be addressed in the works of his predecessors, e.g. in Bïrûnï's Tahdîd nahayât

 al-amâkin.29 Taqï al-Dïn should have computed in some way the period/argument

 from true noon on the given dates to the time when the solstice occurred, and then

 extrapolated the extremal altitude from the rate of change in the sun's declination about

 the solstices; this is, however, very minor, about 14", and thus, it can be deduced that
 his observed values for the solar noon-altitude at the summer and winter solstices

 should not differ too much from 72;30° and 25;32,30°. From these two observations,

 he derives his own unique value ε = 23;28,54° for the obliquity of the ecliptic,30

 which is only about —0;1° in error, and φ =40;58,46° for the latitude of Istanbul.

 [53] [...] in order to derive the time of the vernal equinox, we installed the instru

 ment having the chords {dhât al-awtâr), and observed the shadow-covering by

 means of it. Then, [we found that] it took place before true noon (al-zawâl) on

 Wednesday, 13 Muharram [1] in the year 987 of the noble Hijra, 20 Pharmouthi

 Solar and lunar observations at Istanbul in the 1570s 353

 [8] in the year 2327 Nabonassar, 11 Âdhâr [6] 1890 after the death of Alexander,

 at 2;34,47 equal hours from true noon (sa'ât bu'd mu'addala).31

 [54] Then, on Saturday, 22 Jumâdâ al-Àkhira [6] in the year 987 of Hijra, 22 Thoth

 [1] in the year 2328 Nabonassar, 15 Âb [11] in the year 1890 from the death of

 Alexander, we observed the body of the Great Luminary [i.e., the sun] by the

 armillary sphere some minutes before true noon (al-zawâlί) and by the mural

 meridional quadrant (lubna) at it [i.e., true noon] for the examination of the

 correctness of the two observations. After the agreement of the two observations

 by taking into account the time [of the first observation] from true noon in

 minutes (daqâ'iq al-bu'd), [we found that] it was in the [ecliptic] sign Virgo

 1;21,15° at the time of transiting the meridian (tawassut).32

 [55] After it, on Monday, 23 Rajab [7] in the year 987 of Hijra, the longitude (mawdi ',

 lit. "position") of the Great Luminary was in the [ecliptic] sign Libra 0; 36° in the

 time of passing the meridian as observed by the armillary sphere before true noon

 and the mural quadrant at it and the correct agreement of the two observations by

 the adjustment (ta'dil) mentioned earlier. From the [sun's] mean motion known

 from the New Observations and the derivation of its true daily motion (al-buht),
 it necessitates that the time of the sun's entrance into the head of Libra, the

 autumnal equinox, in hours and their fractions from true noon (sa 'ât al-bu 'd wa

 kusuriha), was 9;22,36h on Sunday, 22 Rajab [987], the 21st of the month of

 Phaophi [2] in the year 2328 Nabonassar, 13 Ay lui [12] in the year 1890 after
 the death of Alexander.33

 These three solar observations are related to the determination of the times of

 equinoxes of 1579 and the position of the sun at an intermediary point, from which the

 basic parameters of the solar model are derived. The accuracy of Taqï al-Dln's values

 for the solar noon-altitudes and times of equinoxes is significant and comparable with

 that of the outstanding figures of the early Islamic period.34 Owing to an error in

 counting the time between the vernal equinox of this year and Ptolemy's observation
 of the same equinox in 140, Taqï al-Dïn deduced a value about 365;14,38,34 days for

 the length of the solar year, which is about 3 min too long.35 Then, having employed

 the general three-point method,36 he obtained the value about 2;0,34 for the solar

 eccentricity (radius of orbit = 60; or 0.01675, if the radius of orbit is taken as the unit)

 and 95;33° for the longitude of its apogee.37 Taqï al-Dîn's documentation of his solar

 observations makes it possible to compute the true values for the eccentricity of the

 32 Taqî al-Dïn, Sidrat, K: f. 36r.

 33 Taqî al-Dïn, Sidrat, K: f. 36r.

 34 See Said and Stephenson (1995).

 35 Note that this corresponds to a mean solar year computed between the two vernal equinoxes in the period

 from 140 to 1579; the true value for such conception of the solar year in this period is 365;14,32,5 days.

 36 About this, see Mozaffari (2013c), pp. 323-324.

 37 Taqî al-Dïh, Sidrat, K: ff. 36r-v (cf. also, Tekeli 1962, 2008). It is somewhat strange that in his later zîj

 (Kharîdat, Β: ff. 28r-v.), Taqî al-Dïn comes back to Ulugh Beg's value for the solar eccentricity, since the

 maximum tabular value for the solar equation of centre in this work is given as 1.9315°, corresponding to
 e «s 2;1,20 (see Mozaffari 2013c, p. 326, Table 3, no. 13).

 earth and the longitude of the solar apogee in a circular orbit, which should be, respec

 tively, 0.01686 and 95;10° for 1579 (in the elliptical orbit: 0.01688 and 95;430).38 His

 values for the solar orbital elements are highly precise: for the longitude of the solar

 apogee, he has one of the most accurate values observed in Islamic astronomy.39 Of

 course, for the eccentricity, his accuracy had already been reached by Ulugh Beg, the

 best of what was achieved in late Islamic astronomy, but not repeating the brilliant

 accuracy of Yahyâ b. Abï Mansûr and BîrûnT with errors, respectively, ~ — 1 χ 10~5

 and +5 χ 10~5.40 It is noteworthy that his value for the eccentricity is remarkably

 better than that of his Danish contemporary, Tycho Brahe, who derived 0.01792 in

 1588 (computed value for a circular orbit: 0.01690; true value in the elliptical orbit:
 0.01688).41

 2.2 The lunar observations

 In what follows, Taqï al-Dïn's reports of his four lunar observations are presented,

 which are also summarized in Table 2. For the lunar eclipses, Taqï al-Dïn uses both

 types of the description of the date of a lunar eclipse as customary in medieval Islamic

 treatises: "on the night whose morning was [the day after eclipse]" and "after the

 meridian passage of the sun on [the preceding day]".

 [Ml] The first of the triple lunar eclipses we observed in the house of the great master
 [...] Sa'd al-Milla wa-'l-Dawla wa-'l-Dïn [.. ,],42 the distance of which from the

 observatory (dâr al-rasad) does not make any perceptible difference in seconds

 [of time]. The time of the middle [i.e., the maximum phase] of the eclipse was
 12;3,56h after the meridian transit of the sun [i.e., true noon] on Sunday, 15

 Rajab [7] 984. [...] The moon was eclipsed by 9 digits of its light.43

 Sa'd al-Dïn Efendï (d. 1599) was one of Taqï al-Dïn supporters, whom he praises in

 the prologue.44 Observations used for the derivation of the mean motions and orbital

 elements of the sun, moon, and planets should be made in or converted to the local

 time of a specific meridian. The place of the observatory was representative of the

 principal longitude of Istanbul, from which its latitude was also measured. Taqï al
 Dïn notes that the difference in longitude between Sa'd al-Dïn's house, where this

 first observation was made, and the observatory, where the second lunar eclipse was

 observed, is sufficiently small as to have no undesirable consequence in the use of
 these observations.

 [M2] [...] the observation of the total lunar eclipse that took place in the night whose

 morning was Wednesday, 15 Muharram [1] in the year 985 of the noble Hijra.

 We found the time of its middle with the utmost investigation with excellent

 masters in the observations by means of the great instruments installed in the

 new observatory [...] to be 9;8,46 after the meridian passage of the sun on

 Tuesday, 14 Muharram in the mentioned year.

 [This was] a total lunar eclipse with a perceptible duration (makth, lit. "stay
 ing").45

 [M3] We were not able to observe the third eclipse, because of the entrance of the

 clouds. Our excellent brothers from Egypt told us of it and also Dâwud al

 Riyâdï transmitted it to us with the measurement of [the altitude)?) of the star]

 Aldebaran [i.e., α Tau]. Then, we converted it to the longitude of Constantinople.
 Then, the time of its middle was 13;36,36h after the meridian transit of the sun

 on Thursday, 14 Rajab [7] in the year 985. So, it occurred in the night whose

 morning was Friday 15 [Rajab].46

 A. Ben-Zaken identifies Dâwud al-Riyâdï (the Mathematician) from Thessalonica

 mentioned in the report of M3 as David Ben-Shushan, a Jewish scholar.47 He appears

 to have measured the altitude of the star Aldebaran (a Tau) at the time of the maximum

 phase of the eclipse, since Taqï al-Dïn immediately mentions that he converted it to

 the meridian of Istanbul, and then gives the time of the middle of the eclipse. No

 information is given on what Taqï al-DTn believes is the difference in longitude of

 Istanbul and whatever place in Egypt the observation was made (probably, Cairo?).

 For all three eclipses, Taqï al-Dïn reports only the time of the middle of the eclipse.

 Because the midpoint of an eclipse is difficult to determine directly from observation,

 it is likely that in all cases he has calculated the midpoint from observations of the

 times of the beginning and end of either the whole eclipse or the total phase of the

 eclipse. This suggests that the reports of the eclipse given by Taqï al-Dïn represent
 observations that have already been through a process of analysis, rather than the

 original raw data of the observations. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the lack

 of details about the altitude of Aldebaran in the final report; only the reduced time has

 been given.

 The fourth observation is used for the measurement of the maximum value of the

 second inequality of the moon and hence its eccentricity in Ptolemy's lunar model.
 Such observations should fulfil some essential conditions: in the time of the observa

 tion, the moon should be near quadrature and have the maximum distance from its
 mean longitude as well as it should culminate, so that its vertical circle of altitude

 is perpendicular to the ecliptic, which is to neutralize the effect of the longitudinal

 component of parallax.48

 45 Taqî al-Dîn, Sidrat, Κ: ff. 41v, 42v. The report of this eclipse is given both on ff. 41v and 42v; the only

 extra data in the second report are the perceptible duration of the eclipse

 Solar and lunar observations at Istanbul in the 1570s 357

 [M4] God rendered those circumstances easy for us in the early morning of Friday,

 18;48,46h after the meridian passage of the sun on Thursday, 21 Shawwâl [10]

 in the year 987 of the noble Hijra. The moon was nearly in the mentioned limits.

 It was not possible for us to observe it by the armillary sphere neither with the

 sun, for it being below the horizon, nor with any of the fixed stars, since it was

 not previously possible for us to record any of them from a reliable observation.

 Thus, we purposed to observe the moon by the [instrument] having the azimuth

 and altitude, and we derived the [oblique] ascension (matâli ') [of the moon] at

 the time of the observation and endeavored to record the procedures with the

 extreme diligence. [...] Then, the longitude of the moon was 176;27°.49

 Taqï al-Dïn evidently states that he could not use the armillary sphere at the time of

 the observation, because he had not yet measured the longitudes of some reference stars

 trustworthily; the task he apparently never found time to accomplish. He thus adhered

 to the methods of the spherical astronomy in order to derive the longitude of the moon

 from its horizontal coordinates as observed by the Altitude-Azimuthal Instrument,

 which is the same instrument called the Two Quadrants by Mu' ayyad al-Dïn al- 'Urdï in

 his treatise FTkayfiyyat al-arsâd, "On how to make the observations", and constructed

 by him at the Maragha observatory.50 The intended time of this observation is when

 the vertical circle of the altitude of the moon is perpendicular to the ecliptic; this, of

 course, occurred after sunrise (7:24 MLT) on Friday, 22 Shawwal 987/11 December

 1579 (JDN 2298132). Moreover, as regards the other three observations, which shall

 presently be discussed in the next section, the time Taqï al-Dïn computes is probably

 in error. As a result, the precise time of this observation cannot be determined with

 certitude, although it should have been made somewhere between 5:45 MLT (the

 meridian passage of the moon) and 6:45 MLT (the start of the civil twilight). At 6:49,
 apparent longitude 176;15°; the allowance has been made for refraction, causing
 a 4' increase in true longitude « 176;11°.

 3 Analysis of the lunar eclipse observations

 In Table 2, we analyse the trio of lunar eclipse observations reported by Taqï al-Dïn.

 It is evident that the times of mid-eclipse that Taqï al-Dïn derived from observations

 are considerably in error. Indeed, they are consistently earlier than the times of mid

 eclipse computed using modern ephemerides by amounts ranging from just under

 40min to over 50min. This poor level of accuracy is rather surprising and compares

 unfavourably with the observation of eclipses by other Islamic astronomers, both from

 the early and from the late period. For example, among the eclipses reported by al

 Battânï, Ibn Yunus (including also observations from Habash al-Hâsib, al-Mâhânï,

 and the Banu Mùsâ), and al-Bïrûnï, no single eclipse timing is in error by more than

 about 36min, and the vast majority have errors of less than 20min,51 irrespective of

 49 Taqï al-Dîn, Sidrat V.7.8: K: f. 48r.

 whether the time was determined using a clepsydra or by the observation of the altitude

 of either the eclipsed luminary or a fixed star.

 Of the late Islamic astronomers, Muhyï al-Dïn has significantly more accurate

 values for the times of the maximum phase of his trio of lunar eclipses than Taqï

 al-Dïn; indeed, the errors in Muhyï al-Dïn's times do not exceed 5 min.52 Muhyï

 al-Dïn made use of a precise clepsydra which was probably implemented by some

 mechanical components, and which made it possible for an operator to measure hour

 and minute separately.53 By contrast, the accuracy of Kâshï's eclipse times is sim
 ilar to those of Taqï al-Dïn.54 Neither Kâshï nor Taqï al-Dïn gives full details of

 how he determined the times. For example, Taqï al-Dïn does not explicitly mention

 whether he used his own mechanical clocks, which were seemingly influenced by

 European sources and models,55 in the observation of his first two lunar eclipses; he

 only refers to "the great instruments installed in the new observatory".56 For the last

 observation, he should have applied the method of spherical astronomy to convert the

 measured/computed time to the meridian of Constantinople, as his reference to the

 star Aldebaran gives testimony to it. The use of this method with not-highly precise

 values for basic parameters, e.g. the geographical latitudes, might partly be responsi

 ble for the appearance of such great errors. The other contributing factor might have

 been the values applied for the difference in longitudes between Cairo/Thessalonica

 and Istanbul. The support comes from the fact that these lunar eclipses were also

 of geographical use for Taqï al-Dïn: in Sidrat II.4,57 he explicitly asserts that from

 his observations of this triple of lunar eclipses, he derived the value 56;39,45° for

 the longitude of Istanbul from the Fortunate Islands; also, in Sidrat V.l,58 where he

 converts the time of one of the lunar eclipses which Ptolemy observed at Alexan

 dria to the meridian of Istanbul, he takes the meridian of Istanbul equal to 56;40°
 and that of Alexandria as 61;54°, and states that the then resulting difference of

 5; 14° in terrestrial longitude between the two cities corresponds to a difference of

 0;20,56h in local times between the two. However, he presumably discarded the value
 56;39,45° for the longitude of Istanbul later, since the relevant lines on f. 17v are

 blacked out and in the geographical table attributed to him,59 the longitudes of Istan
 bul and Alexandria are given, respectively, as 60° and 61;55°. Note that Istanbul
 (longitude L = 28;57° from Greenwich) is actually only about one degree west of
 Alexandria (L =29; 55°).

 Taqï al-Dïn and al-Kàshï's eclipse timings also compare unfavourably with Euro

 pean astronomers of the time. Regiomontanus and his colleague Bernard Walther at the

 end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries observed many eclipses

 Solar and lunar observations at Istanbul in the 1570s 359

 of both the sun and the moon and timed the eclipses with an accuracy of better than

 15 min (in many cases, significantly better), and even Copernicus in the middle of the

 sixteenth century, an astronomer not generally regarded as a particularly accomplished

 observer, observed the times of eclipses with errors of less than about 30 min.60 And

 towards the end of the sixteenth century, at the same time as Taqï al-Dïn, Tycho Brahe

 was determining the time of eclipses to an accuracy of about 12 min.61 Indeed, it is

 worth noting that two of the three eclipses reported by Taqï al-Dïn were also observed

 by Tycho: the eclipses of 2/3 April 1577 and 26/27 September 1577. Tycho observed

 the time of the four phases of the 2/3 April 1577 eclipse, each with an error of about -6,

 +1, -3, and +3 min respectively, in contrast to Taqï al-Dïn's error of about -52 min

 for his determination of the time of mid-eclipse. For the eclipse of 26/27 September

 1577, Tycho observed the time of the end of totality with an error of about -10 min

 in contrast to a -45 min error in Taqï al-Dïn's time of mid-eclipse.

 Of the three eclipses reported by Taqï al-Dïn, two were total and one partial. Taqï

 al-Dïn gives the magnitude in terms of the decrease in the brightness of the lunar disc,

 a term that is not encountered in previous Islamic reports. It is not known whether

 Taqï al-Dïn refers to the eclipsed portion of the lunar diameter or surface; however, the

 naked-eye estimation of the eclipsed area of the sun and moon or even the measurement

 of it by aid of medieval optical aids such as camera obscuras or pinhole image devices

 is difficult, and consequently we assume that Taqï al-Dïn refers to the eclipsed diameter

 of the moon. However, the computed magnitude of 0.842 for the eclipse is equal to

 about 10 digits of the lunar diameter and nearly corresponds to the 10 digits of its

 surface as well, according to the Ptolemaic norm that the angular radius of umbra (i.e.

 the earth's shadow in the distance of the moon from the earth) is 2.6 times as large as the

 apparent diameter of the moon.62 Thus, regardless of whether Taqï al-Dïn refers to the

 eclipsed diameter or surface of the moon, his measured magnitude is -1 digit in error.

 Of the other late Islamic astronomers, Muhyï al-Dïn has exceptionally accurate

 values of the magnitudes for the two partial lunar eclipses he observed at Maragha. He

 expresses the magnitudes in more fractions than one may expect from the ancient and

 medieval normal unit of one-twelfth of the diameter of the lunar disc. His values might

 then have been the results of doing some interpolations after observing the shape of

 eclipses in dioptra and pinhole image devices available to him at Maragha.63

 4 Conclusion

 Taqï al-Dïn was among a small number of the outstanding figures of Islamic astronomy

 that show the admirable intentions to give the full accounts of their observations and

 derivations of parameters. Although, unlike his solar observations, the accuracy of

 his lunar observations compares unfavourably with both earlier and contemporary

 astronomers, his work is important for studying the relationship between observation

 and theory in Islamic astronomy. It is curious that Taqï al-Dïn was among the possessors

 of the only surviving manuscript of Muhyï al-Dïn's Talkhïs al-majistî,64 the work that

 undoubtedly reflects the acme of observational astronomy in the thirteenth-century

 Middle East; it is not hard to imagine a probable positive influence that this work

 might have exercised on Taqï al-DTn to document his observations and to explain the

 procedures of derivations of parameter values from them.
