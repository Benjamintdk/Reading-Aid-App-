 Abstract In On Local Motion in the Two New Sciences, Galileo distinguishes between

 'time' and 'quanto time' to justify why a variation in speed has the same properties as

 an interval of time. In this essay, I trace the occurrences of the word quanto to define

 its role and specific meaning. The analysis shows that quanto is essential to Galileo's

 mathematical study of infinitesimal quantities and that it is technically defined. In

 the light of this interpretation of the word quanto, Evangelista Torricelli's theory

 of indivisibles can be regarded as a natural development of Galileo's insights about

 infinitesimal magnitudes, transformed into a geometrical method for calculating the

 area of unlimited plane figures.

 1 Introduction

 Galileo was one of the most prominent mathematicians of his time in Italy, so much so

 that innovators such as Bonaventura Cavalieri and Evangelista Torricelli held him in

 high regard as a leading authority. Galileo scholars have studied his achievements in

 physics, astronomy, and mechanics, but few have analysed his mathematical research,

 and these have concentrated on his arithmetic of proportions1 and how he applied

 geometry to the study of motion, adopting Archimedes' style.2 It is notable that, for

 example, there is no comprehensive study on Galileo's theory of infinitesimal magni

 tudes even though he uses them in his works in mechanics. In particular, we encounter

 See Giusti (1986) and Giusti (1993), Palmieri (2001).

 infinitesimal magnitudes in his description of how speed varies in accelerated motion

 as well as in his explanation of cohesion.

 In this paper, I examine Galileo's search for a mathematical definition of infini

 tesimal magnitude that he needed to describe the composition and properties of ideal

 matter. I consider the mathematical modelling of Galileo's theory of matter from the

 point of view of mathematics itself without going into physics. I start with an analysis

 of Galileo's technical word quanto. According to the dictionary5 of the Accademia

 della Crusca, the word quanto is related to "magnitude"4 but the dictionary does not

 elaborate on its type. Stillman Drake considered the word quanto a physical term

 and translates it by "quantified parts", which means "capable of being counted" and

 "divided".5 However, this is vague from a mathematical standpoint, so I shall try to

 clarify the meaning of this important term. When quoting Galileo, I either retain the

 original word (quanto, quanti) or add to Drake's English translation the original text

 in square brackets.6

 2 Raising the question

 Galileo's Two New Sciences (1638)7 represents the culmination of 50 years of his

 pondering the nature of materials and local motion, and shows the way he applied

 mathematics to mechanics. The book has the form of a dialogue between Salviati,

 Simplicio, and Sagredo. These characters have three different approaches to the study

 of natural philosophy. The first, Salviati, represents Galileo, whose concern is primar

 ily mathematical. The second, Simplicio, is an Aristotelian who supports the orthodox,

 qualitative view. The third, Sagredo, gives the impression that he occupies the middle

 ground but actually always agrees with Salviati. The Two New Sciences is divided into

 four Days. The First Day is devoted to consideration of the way infinity is involved

 in cohesion as well as in a continuous variation of speed, the Second Day to demon
 strations of the resistance of solid bodies to fracture and their cohesion, and the Third

 and the Fourth Days to demonstrations concerning local motion.

 Let us consider Galileo's description of variation of speed in accelerated motion

 presented in the treatise On Local Motion, at the beginning of the Third Day.8 He

 defines equably or uniformly accelerated motion as the motion which "abandoning rest,

 adds on to itself equal momenta of swiftness in equal times".9 In Galileo's technical

 language, the phrase "momenta of swiftness" means a sequence of intensities of speed,

 each acquired in a given instant of time. Momentum is a synonym of degree ("gradum")

 as is confirmed by the phrase "the degree or the momentum of speed" a few lines before

 the definition of uniformly accelerated motion.10

 Time and speed are continuous quantities that vary from zero to a finite value, by

 taking all other values in between. At one point, Simplicio says to Salviati: "But if

 the degrees of greater and greater tardity are infinite, it will never consume them all,

 and this rising heavy body will never come to rest, but will move forever while always

 slowing down—something that is not seen to happen".11 His objection is founded

 on the hypothesis that in a continuum, there is an infinite number of intermediate

 increments or decrements ("degrees") of a certain magnitude between two of its states.

 Simplicio is saying that the process of deceleration of a moving body would never

 finish if it were true that there are an infinite number of decrements of speed that to go

 through before it comes to rest. Salviati replies: "This would be so, Simplicio, if the

 moveable were to hold itself for any time in each degree; but it merely passes there,

 without remaining beyond an instant".12

 Here, Galileo is explaining the reason the final speed of a decelerating body can

 become zero, although it passes through infinite decrements of speed. The key point

 is to check the duration of each degree of speed, that is, to establish a relation between

 speed and time. When the degree of speed retains the same value during a small interval

 of time, Galileo states that it is not possible for a body in a decelerated motion, as a

 body thrown upward, to reach a state of rest, for if it maintains the same speed Avj at

 the beginning and end of some finite interval of time At-,, it could continue at the same

 speed through the next interval, and so on, with uniform motion ad infinitum. Although

 Galileo does not mention it, the same explanation can apply to an accelerated motion, as

 a falling body, for if its speed remains the same in a finite interval, it too could continue

 at the same speed in the next interval, and so would also move uniformly ad infinitum.

 But when the duration of each speed is an "instant", the final speed is either zero or

 some finite value. Thus, either the speed varies continuously, as we see of rising and

 falling bodies, or it does not vary at all. This is a characteristic Galilean argument, and

 the conclusion is beyond doubt. The question now is what is meant by continuously.

 Galileo bases his argument on our everyday perception of time that a finite time

 interval is composed of an infinite number of time instants. However, he intends to

 apply the same logic to speed. In order to proceed, he needs to identify the speed equiv

 alents of time instant and time interval. The fact that the body must pass through each

 speed "without remaining beyond an instant" suggests a parallel between sequences of

 point-like instants f, and point-like speeds v,. His solution then is to consider degrees

 of speed u; related to tj, for if speed u, changes in each instant with tj, a final finite

 speed is reached in a finite time interval. However, Galileo leaves some unanswered

 10 Galileo's original text is "gradum seu momentum velocitatis" (Galilei 1890-1909, VIII, p. 198,1. 10).

 "Momentum of swiftness" must not be interpreted as "mechanical moment", which points to the static effect

 of the heaviness of a body, a technical word which belongs to pre-modern studies on machines. Mechanical

 moment varies according to the distance of the body from the centre of rotation that is the length of a lever

 arm as in the principle of the lever. As far as the evolution of the meaning of "momentum of swiftness" is

 concerned, see Galluzzi (1979), in particular p. 364, footnote 2.

 questions: "Where is the boundary between instants r, and time intervals At,T and

 "When does a decreasing At; become a f;?".

 In his argument, Salviati makes the following remark: "And since in any finite

 time [ogni tempo quanto], however small, there are infinitely many instants, there are

 enough to correspond to the infinitely many degrees of diminished speed".13 This is

 the point at which Galileo first mentions term quanto. The translation is correct in

 its meaning that tempo quanto is a "finite time". But what is a quantol The word is

 here a noun meaning "quantity" or "amount", so literally tempo quanto means "time

 quantity" or "amount of time". In order to answer this question, we need to return to

 the part of the First Day concerning resistance of materials to fracture and examine

 Galileo's explanation of cohesion.

 3 The mathematical nature of a quanto

 During the First Day, Galileo explains the reasons why he believes that cohesion
 ("coerenza") is a direct consequence of presence of voids inside matter. He describes

 the role of voids, measures their presence, and explains how their interaction with mat

 ter particles gives rise to, as an example, a "continuous material" like water.14 Galileo

 attempts to demonstrate that the presence of voids is enough to explain cohesion, since

 "although such voids are very tiny, and as a result each one is easily overpowered,

 still the innumerable multitude of them multiplies the resistances innumerably, so to

 speak".15 It is necessary to prove geometrically "how it might be demonstrated that

 in a finite continuous extension it is not impossible for infinitely many voids to be

 found"16 if voids are actually infinitely small. The illustration that serves his purpose

 is the paradox known as Aristotle's wheel.17 Galileo resolves the paradox in two steps,

 examining two concentric, n-sided regular polygons in the first, and two concentric
 circles in the second.

 In the first, he comes to a solution using standard geometry, while in the second,

 he uses a new technique of assigning to the circles properties already proved for
 polygons. Galileo's strategy works because a polygon can have as many sides as

 required, even though their number must be finite. But an indefinite number of sides is

 a necessary condition for the application of Eudoxus's method of exhaustion, which

 Galileo applies to a polygon inscribed in a circle. This allows him to inscribe polygons

 with an unlimited number of sides until there are so many that they look like points on

 a circle. On this basis, he is able to define a circle as a polygon with an infinite number

 of sides (Fig. 1 ).

 17 The problem of the wheel (see Fig. I ) is the paradox of two concentric circles rotating around their
 common centre (4) and on a surface (BF). In the first case, two points (C and B) on each one of them draw

 two circumferences with different length around the common centre A. In the second case, the same points

 draw two identical straight lines (C£ and BF). It was solved firstly by Jean Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan.

 Galileo's solution of the paradox is ingenious and deserves attention since it shows

 how he studies geometrical objects with infinitely many sides:

 I say that in polygons of one hundred thousand sides, the line passed over and

 measured by the perimeter of the larger—that is, by the hundred thousand sides

 extended [straight and] continuously—is equal to that measured by the hundred

 thousand sides of the smaller, but with the interposition [among these] of one
 hundred thousand void spaces. And just so, I shall say, in the circles (which are
 polygons of infinitely many sides) the line passed over by the infinitely many
 sides of the large circle, arranged continuously [in a straight line], is equal in
 length to the line passed over by the infinitely many sides of the smaller, but in

 the latter case with the interposition of as many voids between them.18

 Here, we are in an exclusively mathematical domain. At the core of his solution

 to the paradox of the wheel is the question of how to add geometrical objects, which
 can be either an unlimited, infinite sequence of sides, or sides and voids, or points of
 tangency.

 4 The grammar of the quanti

 The quanto is introduced to refute the idea of Sagredo that the points on the smaller
 circumference can be dragged along line CE (see Fig. 1) over a very small segment,
 called the "particle" (particella) of the line.19 Since the points on the line CE touching
 the smaller circumference, the "contacts" (toccamenti), are infinite, "the dragging
 along CE would be infinitely many; and being quantified [quanti], these would form
 an infinite line; but CE is finite".20

 Salviati compares a circumference of finite length y to a regular polygon with an
 infinite number of sides that are the points of tangency (toccamenti) of the circum
 ference and an external line.21 Referring to the common centre of the circles, the

 rotational motion of the circumference is such that every point on it corresponds to

 21 Galileo is considering a circumference consisting of a countable infinity of points. Therefore, its length

 is the sum of a countable infinity of magnitudes.

 a particle that belongs also to either line CE or BF. Looking at the motion from a

 reference frame external to the circles, the particle thus appears to be a very short seg

 ment, drawn by dragging the point in question along the line. At this point, we seem

 to encounter a contradiction: the finite length y is composed of a sum of infinitely

 many points of the circumference, while a sum of the lengths of the infinite particles is

 infinite since for Galileo those particles are tiny and quantified (quante). Let us clarify
 Galileo's geometrical reasoning.

 Galileo knows that a sum of an infinite number of some magnitudes is finite. For

 example, the infinitely many points on a circumference form a circumference of a

 finite length. However, he also knows that a sum of an infinite number of other mag

 nitudes has to be infinite, for example, the sum of an infinite number of line segments

 however small, even infinitesimal, they may be. This way he obtains two infinite sets

 of infinitesimal magnitudes, such that the sum of the first set is finite, while the sum

 of the other is infinite.22 He suspects that there is a fundamental difference between
 the elements of these two sets.

 He realizes that he needs to identify a criterion for differentiating between those

 two sets of magnitudes, be they numbers or geometrical objects. He begins by intro

 ducing new terminology. He names quanti the mathematical objects, either finite or

 smaller than any assignable magnitude, an infinite number of which produces an

 infinite sum, and he calls not-quanti (non-quanti) or indivisibles (indivisibili), the

 mathematical objects, an infinite number of which produces a finite sum.23 Galileo

 thus defines two types of infinitesimal magnitudes, quanti, however small, which may

 be divided, and, as we shall now write, non-quanti or indivisibles, which may not be
 divided.

 Let us go back to the paradox of Aristotle's wheel to show the distinction of quanti

 and not-quanti or non-quanti. In the quotation. Galileo explains that, in a complete

 revolution, the length of the line drawn by the smaller circle is equal to the length of the

 line drawn by the larger, because the line drawn by the smaller includes intermediate

 voids. After considering polygons of 100,000 sides, he writes of circles:

 And just as the "sides" [of circles] are not quanti [non son quanti], but are

 infinitely many, so the interposed voids are not quanti, but are infinitely many;

 that is, for the former [line touched by the larger circle there are] infinitely many

 points, all filled [tuttipieni], and for the latter [line touched by the smaller circle],

 infinitely many points, part of them filled points and part voids.24

 The sides of both circumferences are "not quanti", or as we say, non-quanti, which

 is a necessary condition for a finite perimeter, and they are infinite in number. In

 order to add voids to filled points, the voids must also be non-quanti and infinite

 in number. Galileo explains that on the line (BF) traced by the large circumference

 ~ The modern technical term infinitesimal is used here to describe a magnitude that, as Galileo understands

 it, is extremely small, as small as can possibly be, but not zero in size.

 24 Galileo seems to have established a sort of relation between points and numbers as if he wanted to

 measure points in some ways. In Euclidean geometry, a point has no dimension, neither length, width, nor

 depth, so we can identify the dimension of a point as zero.

 there are infinitely many filled points, and on the line (CE) traced by the smaller

 circumference there are infinitely many filled and empty points, point-like voids. He

 treats voids in the same way he treats points, which is why he gives them the shape of

 points, an empty space inside a border. Therefore, an empty point is nothing but a point

 with a void inside. What he has done is to change Euclid's concept of a point to a new

 geometrical object that is either filled or empty, although he never stated it in just these

 terms.

 above argument is correct:

 Salviati, at this point, stresses a crucial fact in order to convince the reader that the

 Here I want you to note how, if a line is resolved and divided into parts that

 are quante and consequently numbered [numerate], we cannot then arrange

 these into a greater extension than that which they occupied when they were

 continuous and joined, without the interposition of as many void [finite] spaces.

 But imagining the line resolved into non-quante parts [parti non quante]—that

 is, into its infinitely many indivisibles—we can conceive it immensely expanded

 without the interposition of any quanti void spaces, though not without infinitely

 many indivisible voids.25

 The point made here is that if a line is divided into quanti, these quanti can be

 reassembled to form a longer line only by the imposition of finite quanti voids. But if

 the line is divided into non-quanti, it may be immensely expanded by the interposition

 of infinitely many non-quanti voids. And this can be extended to surfaces and solid

 bodies composed of infinitely many non-quanti atoms, which can be expanded into

 immense space without the interposition of quanti voids, but only of infinitely many

 non-quanti voids. "What is thus said of simple lines is to be understood also of surfaces

 and of solid bodies, considering those as composed of infinitely many non-quanti
 atoms".26

 Referring to atoms brings the dialogue back to where it started, to the composition

 of water, containing an infinite number of voids, even though Galileo's concept of an

 atom as presented here is not material. This characteristic makes the distance between

 the atom of the atomists and this one insurmountable.27 Galileo's atom consists only

 of space inside a three-dimensional form.

 Once again Galileo offers a profound and articulated vision and, with the limited

 tools he has, describes an architecture that could represent a new chapter of geome

 try. Nevertheless, those looking for a complete mathematics of quanti would remain

 disappointed to see that Galileo limits himself to introducing some new terms and

 describing their application only in outline. Thus, his use of quanti is not a mathemati

 cal theory about infinitesimal magnitudes; rather, it is a theory expressed only verbally.

 But it is sufficiently detailed and consistent that it leads to powerful developments in

 the work of one of his followers of great talent, Evangelista Torricelli, as we shall

 see.

 5 A new order in the infinitesimally small

 In the analysis of the paradox of the Aristotle's wheel, two problems are intertwined:

 the analysis of the compound motion and the one-to-one relationship between the

 points belonging to two different circumferences. Both issues involve the concepts of

 continuity, infinity, and numbers:28

 SALV. Now let us pass to another consideration, which is that the line, and

 every continuum, being divisible into ever-divisibles (sempre divisibili), I do

 not see how to escape their composition from infinitely many indivisibles; for

 division and subdivision that can be carried on forever assumes that the parts

 are infinitely many. Otherwise the subdivision would come to an end. And the

 existence of infinitely many parts has as a consequence their being non-quante,

 since infinitely many quante [parts] make up an infinite extension. And thus we

 have the continuum composed of infinitely many indivisibles.29

 The indivisibles must not be confused with Euclid's points. For Galileo, the most

 basic elements of any continuous geometrical object, which is infinitely divisible

 by definition, are the indivisibles, otherwise known as non-quanti. A "divisible and

 quanti" magnitude, i.e. one that is continuous and measurable, can only be obtained by

 putting together an infinite number of indivisibles. If a limited number of them were

 used, even a very large one, the result would always be zero according to Galileo's
 new arithmetic laws.20

 The concept of quanto is subtle. In Galileo's opinion, apart from defining a magni

 tude, very small but finite, it is also the smallest geometrical object that maintains the

 property of continuity. The indivisible, on the other hand, terminates the continuity

 since it cannot be further subdivided. The number of quanti inside continuous magni

 tudes is neither finite nor infinite, but exactly as large as suits the purpose: "the quante

 parts in the continuum are [...] neither finite nor infinitely many, but so many as to

 correspond to every specified number".21 Further, Galileo is aware that infinity does

 not conform to the laws of arithmetic: "for I consider that the attributes of greater,

 lesser, and equal do not suit infinities, of which it cannot be said that one is greater,

 or less than, or equal to, another".22 As a proof, Galileo provides a comparison of an

 infinite sequence of natural numbers (n) with a sequence of their squares (n2).

 The quanto could be an object of either very large or a very small size but never

 zero. The second case is what interests Galileo, since in this case quanto is placed

 among infinitesimal objects, but at a higher level than indivisibles:

 28 '"We are concerned, in the problem of ARISTOTLE'S Wheel, with two matters, (1) the problem of

 motion, particularly the composition of motions, and (2) the point-to-point correspondence of paths of

 different lengths. These matters are, to be sure, only apparently independent, for both are, at least from one

 view-point, ultimately bound up with the problems of continuity, infinity, and the number system" (Drabkin

 1950. p. 169).

 Understanding infinitesimal magnitudes 129

 SALV. Here I want to say something that will perhaps astonish you concerning

 the possibility of resolving a line into its infinitely many [points] by following

 the procedure that others use in dividing into forty, sixty, or a hundred parts;

 [...] Pursuing that method, anyone who believes he can find its infinitely many

 points is badly mistaken, for with such a procedure he will never achieve the

 division of the line into all its quante parts, even if he goes on forever; and as to

 its indivisibles, he would be so far from arriving at the desired end by that path

 that instead, he would be travelling away from it.33

 Here, Galileo is also stating that the procedure of decomposition of a continuous

 magnitude into quanti would fail because it would have to be applied an infinite

 number of times. Moreover, it would not be possible to make a transition from quanti

 to indivisibles. In other words, Galileo is not able to provide a geometrical procedure

 that would show that quanti consist of indivisibles. In this sense, we can claim that

 there exists a discontinuity, a break, in the decomposition of a continuous magnitude

 into its indivisibles, the ultimate components of a geometrical continuum. Therefore,

 Galileo appears unable to prove the existence of indivisibles from a mathematical

 point of view. He seems to be creating duplicate infinitesimal objects, since quanti and

 indivisibles do not differ in their mathematical nature but only in the characteristics

 of the result produced by their addition. This duplication solves only the issue of

 summing an infinite sequence of magnitudes. Furthermore, Galileo knows that quanti

 are real mathematical objects, since they come into existence through a division of a

 continuous magnitude. After all, they are just another way of representing the shortest

 possible segments. But how can he prove that the same is true for indivisibles?

 6 The proof of existence of the indivisibles

 The relations between the geometrical objects, such as a point, a line, a straight line, a

 surface, and the space, are presented in Euclid's Elements. Even for Galileo "a line [...]

 contains infinitely many points",34 although to separate "the points from one another

 and show them to you distinctly one by one on this paper"35 is impossible. However,

 "it is not impossible to resolve a line into its infinitely many points, and not only that,

 but that this presents no greater difficulty than to distinguish its quante parts".36

 The problem Galileo has to solve now is understanding if and how a point can

 generate a line, a line can generate a surface, and a surface can generate a solid when a

 line, a surface, and a solid differ from each another by one dimension. In other words,

 how is it possible that a point, an object without parts and zero-dimensional, can

 generate a line that is a one-dimensional figure? How is it possible that by summing

 all the elements (points), we manage to obtain a finite length that is not zero?

 Galileo was convinced that the answer to these questions lay in the existence of

 indivisible objects at the very basic level of geometrical continuum. Do they really

 exist? The necessity to describe the behaviour of continuous matter in a consistent way

 proved the existence of indivisibles and quanti by logical deduction. From the logical

 mathematical point of view, this should have been sufficient. However, Galileo is not

 satisfied and he decides to go further than this. He looks for a geometrical procedure that

 identifies the indivisibles by construction, of which he shows examples for polygons
 and a circle:

 SALV. [...] when I form of this line a polygon of infinitely many sides-that is,
 when I bend it into the circumference of a circle—[...] such a resolution [of a

 line] is made into its infinitely many points [...]. The circle, which is a polygon

 of infinitely many sides, touches the straight line with one of its sides, which

 is a single point, different from all its neighbours, and therefore divided and

 distinguished from them no less than is one side of the polygon from its adjacent

 [sides]. And as the polygon, rotated on a plane, stamps out with the successive

 contacts of its sides a straight line equal to its perimeter, so does the circle, when

 rolled on a plane, describe with its infinitely many successive contacts a straight

 line equal to its circumference.-'7

 An indivisible is, therefore, identified by the part of the circumference touched by

 its tangent, which Euclid calls a point but for Galileo must possess characteristics

 that differentiate it from Euclid's point. This could have been the origin of his idea of
 indivisibles.

 7 Torricelli's discoveries

 To arrive at his definition of indivisible, Torricelli starts from lessons of Galileo and

 studies of Cavalieri.38 In particular, in his notes called Field of Truffles7'9, he presents

 some simple geometrical problems (Propositions 73-80) involving indivisibles. In

 another set of notes, collected under the title Against Infinite Aggregates,40 he uses a

 standard idea of indivisible that, surprisingly, leads to wrong conclusions. The samples

 of some of these, collected by Viviani and titled On Indivisibles,41 in particular those in

 the section called On the Method of Indivisibles Wrongly Applied,42 help us understand

 the issues Torricelli was grappling with.

 One of the examples from this section shows rectangle ABCD divided by diagonal
 BD (see Fig. 2). The points (for instance, E) on the diagonal are used in order to
 define a one-to-one relationship between two cross-sections, FE and EG, belonging

 to two congruent triangles, ADB and CDB. These triangles are sets or aggregates of

 the cross-sections and contain the same number of elements. Since every segment

 FE, which is an infinitesimal part of triangle ABD, is longer than the corresponding

 segment EG, an infinitesimal part of triangle BCD, Torricelli realizes that this would

 lead to a wrong conclusion that the area of triangle ABD is also larger than the area

 of triangle BCD.43 Even though Torricelli does not make explicit comments in this

 respect, from the context we can deduce his dilemma: Under what conditions does a

 geometrical property that is true for each indivisible remain valid also for an aggregate
 of them?

 Torricelli realizes that if the procedure of this example is correct from the logical

 formal point of view, then the wrong conclusion must be coming from the relation

 between the linear cross-sections of the plane figures. There is no doubt that the number

 of the cross-sections is the same in both triangles since the corresponding segments

 are always joined at one point. Thus, the fault must be related to the way the above
 relation is defined, so Torricelli decides to examine this issue further. For Torricelli,

 differing from Galileo, the existence of a one-to-one relationship between the elements

 of two sets is not a sufficient guarantee of a correct result. Regarding the problem of

 Aristotle's wheel, Galileo had presumed a relation between points of a different inner

 structure made up of voids and non-voids. It looks as if Torricelli took up this idea

 and developed it further. His working assumption was that the indivisibles were not

 all the same: "[That] All indivisibles," he writes, "seem equal to one another, that is,

 points are equal to points, lines are equal in thickness to lines, and surfaces are equal in

 thickness to surfaces, is an opinion that in my judgment is not only difficult to prove,

 but false".44 Coming back to the example of two concentric circles, for Torricelli, they

 have a one-to-one relationship because each radius of the larger circle includes a radius

 of the smaller circle. This radius intersects each circle in one point. As a consequence,

 43 Cavalieri's scholars have proved that the notion of a whole of lines, called aggregate, is neither to be

 thought of as a set of lines in the modern sense nor as a figure compounded of line-like indivisibles. See

 the two circumferences have the same number of points. However, the circumferences

 have different lengths, proportional to their radii.

 Starting with these assumptions, for Torricelli, the natural consequence must be

 that the corresponding point-like objects are not zero-dimensional, but instead have at

 least a length. This length is far too short to be treated by the traditional geometrical

 procedures, but is fundamental when working at the level of infinitesimals. Referring

 to the concentric circles, every radius intersecting both the circumferences cuts out

 two arcs of a very short length, but whose ratio is precisely defined, equal to the ratio

 of the two radii. Using this ratio enables us to explain the reason their lengths differ

 even though they are made up of an identical number of infinitesimal elements. Could

 this example be generalized into a working geometrical procedure? If yes, under what
 conditions?

 In Torricelli's work, two prototypical situations appear which reappear in other

 problems of plane geometry. The first involves right-angle triangle ABC (see Fig. 3):

 If through the triangle ABC, having its side AB greater than its side BC, we

 imagine to draw all the infinite straight lines parallel to the base AC [r is one

 of them], the points [D] marked by the line segment [r] on the straight line AB

 will be as many as those [E] on BC. Thus, one point [D] on that is to one point
 [E] of this as the whole line [BC] to the whole line [BA].45

 On the basis of what we have just seen, Torricelli believes that indivisibles are

 not all indistinguishable and identical to each other. Their infinitesimal dimension is
 reflected on a macroscopic scale in the length of the segment they form, allowing
 calculation of a well-defined ratio. The indivisibles of Torricelli, thus, must be the

 result of a decomposition of a geometrical, continuous object like, in the language of

 Galileo, quanti.

 Let us consider another situation presented in Fig. 4, which shows two parallel

 ograms (rectangle ABEC and parallelogram ABDF) that have base AB in common,

 same height EB, but the two remaining sides different. From Euclid 1.35, the paral

 lelograms have the same area. From each point H on AB, we can trace segments HG

 and HI, which are parallel to the second side, respectively, of the rectangle and of the

 parallelogram. As a consequence, all segments HG, potentially infinitely many, taken

 together as aggregate would be equal to the aggregate of all of the equally numerous

 segments HI taken together. This is paradoxical since each HG has a length shorter

 than the corresponding HI. The only possible explanation for Torricelli is to consider

 the indivisibles of the plane figure, HG and HI, having two dimensions which must

 be inversely proportional to each other: the longer the length of HG, the shorter its
 width. In this way, their aggregates can have equal areas.

 For Torricelli, the indivisible must always have the same number of dimensions

 as the geometrical object to which it belongs and whose properties it reproduces on
 infinitesimal scale. Therefore, when working with plane figures, the indivisible of aline

 is a point-like rectangle (see EI in Fig. 5), while the indivisible of a plane figure is a line

 like rectangle. In case of solids, the indivisible of a line is a point-like parallelepiped, the

 indivisible of a plane figure is a line-like parallelepiped, and the indivisible of a solid is

 a surface-like parallelepiped. In this sense, for instance, a linear indivisible is not a line,
 but a three-dimensional object which has two infinitesimal dimensions out of three.
 In this way, it becomes possible to use the relationship between the linear dimension
 and the second dimension (infinitesimal but not zero) to calculate the area of a figure,
 assumed to be the sum of an infinite number of linear indivisibles. The capabilities of

 these new indivisibles are applicable also to a completely new domain, such as that of

 curved plane figures, of surfaces of solids of revolution and of solid figures.

 With these assumptions, Torricelli applies the rigour of Euclid's geometry on an

 infinitesimal scale in order to define a proper theory of indivisibles. His definition

 gives the indivisibles some properties of Galileo's quanti, since they are continuous
 objects and have finite dimensions. At the same time, they differ from them, since a
 sum of infinitely many indivisibles is not necessarily infinite. In this way, Torricelli
 simultaneously eliminates Galileo's distinction between quanti and indivisibles, and

 provides the basis of a primordial infinitesimal calculus. His new mathematical instru
 ment was so powerful that by applying it, Torricelli became the first mathematician

 who correctly calculated the area of an equilateral hyperbola, which is a plane figure
 that is not closed.

 8 Applications of the model of the quanti

 Returning to where we started, that is, to the beginning of the Two New Sciences, where

 the three main characters are discussing the cohesion of bodies, we can see why the

 distinction of quanti and non-quanti is a geometrical model suitable for describing the

 fluid behaviour of water. Galileo asserts that "the minimum [particles] into which water

 seems to be resolved [...] are quite different from quanti-like and divisible minimum

 [particles], and I cannot find any other difference here besides that of their being
 indivisible".46

 It looks, indeed, as if there exists a hierarchy in the order of magnitude of the

 geometrical objects, which begins with continuous and finite-dimension objects on a

 larger scale, and goes down to quanti and to non-quanti or indivisibles on a smaller

 scale. This order is also present in nature: "an experience that tends in the direction of

 composition of infinitely many indivisibles into physical materials".47 This composi

 tion goes from the level of bodies, to particles, and down to atoms. A similar hierarchy

 is also noticeable in the structure of temporal continuum from measurable time, to
 momenta, and down to instants:

 If we were to apply similar reasoning to the case of circles, we should have to say

 that where the sides of any polygon are contained within some number, the sides

 of any circle are infinitely many; the former are quanti and divisible, the latter

 non-quanti and indivisible; either end of each side of the revolving polygon stays

 fixed for a time [...], whereas in circles the delays of the ends of their infinitely

 many sides are momentary, because an instant in a finite time is a point in a line

 that contains infinitely many [points].48

 However, the study of how this model of quanti was applied in Galileo's mechanics

 lies beyond the scope of this essay 49

 9 Conclusion

 The linguistic analysis provided here shows that Galileo gave a technical meaning to

 the word quanto. In trying to identify its role and technical meaning, I have attempted

 to clarify Galileo's view of the structure of the continuum in geometry. On the one

 hand, quanto is a mathematical object that may be divided into indefinitely many parts

 at which point it could be described as an infinitesimal magnitude, continuous by

 nature. A sum of infinitely many infinitesimal quanti is always infinite, and therefore,

 Galileo cannot assume that the quanto is the ultimate constituent of a line. On the other

 hand, Galileo knows that neither a finite nor an infinite number of Euclidean points

 creates a line. Thus, he finds it reasonable to assume the existence of indivisibles as

 the ultimate constituents of geometric objects, be they a line or a quanto. Galileo's

 indivisibles are so small as to be unquantifiable, non-quanti, and point-like. Infinitely

 many indivisibles create a line, and a sum of infinitely many indivisibles is finite. They

 can be described as the limit of a set of quanti, and this limit is not continuous. While

 this solution was good enough for natural philosophy, it was not for mathematics

 since the level of idealization of the infinitely small that he reached was insufficient

 to provide a proper arithmetic for them.

 Torricelli agreed with Galileo's view on a philosophical level. By trying to fill

 the mathematical gap between quanti and indivisibles, he created a new infinitesimal

 object, which he also named indivisible. His notion of indivisible, however, has the

 characteristics of being divisible like a continuous magnitude or quanto, as well as

 being at the base of geometrical objects. Only in this way was he able to explain how

 a point can generate a line or a line can generate a surface. By giving a size to his

 indivisibles, he was also able to develop a mathematical procedure adequate to identify

 either the area of a surface or the volume of a solid figure of the most general shape.
