 Abstract The two brothers Julius and Adolf Hurwitz were born in the middle of the

 nineteenth century in a small town near Hanover (not far from Gôttingen). Already

 during their schooldays, the two of them became acquainted with mathematical prob

 lems and both started to study mathematics, but while the younger brother Adolf turned

 out to be extremely successful in his research, the elder brother and his work seem

 to be almost forgotten. This paper examines the lives and works of the two brothers

 with particular emphasis on the contributions of Julius Hurwitz, and the subsequent

 reception of their research. It deals with the development of an arithmetical theory

 for complex continued fractions by Julius and Adolf Hurwitz around 1890 and its

 rediscovery in the twentieth century.

 1 The road to Konigsberg

 Once upon a time, two brothers were born into a Jewish family in Hildesheim near
 Hanover: Julius on July 14,1857, and Adolf Hurwitz on March 26,1859.1 There had

 been two more children in the Hurwitz family, namely a sister Jenny who died already

 in 1855 at age one, and an elder brother Max [Mosche], born August 22, 1855, who

 died on July 17,1910 in Zurich (where his younger brother Adolf lived at that time).

 The paths of life of Julius and Adolf Hurwitz were to be both closely linked and still

 greatly different.

 In the beginning, the education of the two brothers ran in parallel. According to their

 school certificates2 both were good pupils with quite good marks, and in particular,

 both Julius and Adolf Hurwitz must have made an excellent impression in mathematics.

 It seems that Julius may have been a little more open to distractions; there is an interest

 ing remark in one of the school documents concerning Julius visiting a tavern outside

 lessons. And yet the two of them spent Sunday afternoons having geometry lessons at
 the home of their teacher Hermann Casar Hannibal Schubert, the inventor of the so

 called Schubert calculus in enumerative geometry. This proved to be a fruitful invest

 ment: Adolf Hurwitz's first paper (Hurwitz and Schubert 1876) is a joint work with

 Schubert on Chasles' theorem.3 The teacher's driving force and his mathematical influ

 ence on the brothers were indeed fortunate since Schubert left Hildesheim for Hamburg

 in 1876 after only five years.4 Although his results with Adolf Hurwitz were more

 obvious, Schubert decided that both pupils could have aspired to an academic career.

 Unfortunately, the father of Julius and Adolf Hurwitz was sceptical about those

 plans, and moreover, he was not very well-off. He, Salomon Eduard Hurwitz, was a

 merchant, and a widower after the boys' mother, Elise Wertheimer, died5 in 1862 when

 Julius was five and Adolf three years old.6 Although the partnership of Salomon and

 Elise might not have been the best, the relationship of the three Hurwitz boys with their

 father must have been very close. Adolf Hurwitz's later wife Ida described the father

 as follows: "Moreover he set a high value that the young boys started smoking since he

 could not imagine a proper man without cigar or better a pipe."7 When Schubert came

 1 The common Jewish surname Hurwitz (as well as Horowitz and Hurewicz) is a reference to the historically

 portentous small town Hoïovice in Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

 2 Those certificates of the Realgymnasium Andreanum in Hildesheim can be found in the municipal archive
 of Hildesheim (cf. Rasche 2011, Appendix).

 3 Chasles' theorem allows one to count the number of curves satisfying certain algebraic conditions within a

 family of conics; it generalizes Bézout's theorem and plays a significant role in algebraic geometry. Schubert

 developed a calculus in order to solve counting problems of such type (1879), and Hilbert's problem number

 15 asks for a rigorous justification of Schubert's enumerative calculus.

 Knaben schon sehr ffiihzeitig zu rauchen begannen, da ihm ein rechter Mann ohne Cigarie Oder besser
 noch Pfeife kaum denkbar war" (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984,2). If not indicated differently, all translations from

 German to English have been made by the authors.

 to Salomon Hurwitz "to convince him to let both sons choose to study mathematics,"8

 Salomon consulted a prosperous childless friend E. Edwards who offered to finance

 the studies of one of the sons. After questioning Schubert, finally Adolf was selected

 and Julius had to follow the path of his elder brother Max. Julius Hurwitz did an

 apprenticeship in Nordhausen, a small town in today's Thuringia, and became a bank

 clerk. In this profession, he worked for many years, probably first in Hamburg9 and

 later in Hanover, where he and his brother Max took over the banking business of their

 deceased uncle Adolph Wertheimer.

 At the age of 18, Adolf Hurwitz started to study at the polytechnic university in
 Munich10 and attended Felix Klein's lectures. Later, he moved to Berlin,11 where

 Kronecker and Weierstrass were his teachers, and in 1880, Adolf Hurwitz followed

 Klein to Leipzig to continue his studies.12 In 1881, Hurwitz obtained a doctoral degree

 for his work on modular functions (Hurwitz 1881).13 In a retrospective, his supervisor,

 Felix Klein, wrote that from his school Hurwitz and Dyck made the most important

 contributions to Riemann's theory of functions.14 In fact, Klein was at the peak of his
 scientific career when Adolf Hurwitz did his doctorate and Klein's research benefited

 considerably from his pupils' investigations.

 Adolf Hurwitz faced certain difficulties at the University of Leipzig with respect

 to his school education at the Realgymnasium Andreanum at Hildesheim. This type

 of school had been introduced in Prussia in the middle of the nineteenth century to

 provide an advanced education for more than the privileged youth, and it placed an

 emphasis on mathematics, natural sciences, and modern languages. However, some

 universities did not value these new institutions highly and students with such an

 educational background, lacking sufficient knowledge of Greek and Latin, could not

 obtain higher degrees (cf. Hilbert 1921, XIV; Rowe 2007,23).

 In 1882, Adolf Hurwitz returned to the University of Berlin, where Weierstrass

 especially was interested in his function-theoretical work and proposed him his first
 post-doctoral subject (cf. Hurwitz-Samuel 1984, 6). Supported by Kronecker and
 Klein, Hurwitz moved in the following year to the more liberal Gôttingen University
 where he finished his Habilitation around Easter and became a Privatdozent,15

 8 "Schubert suchte sogar den Vater auf, um ihn zu bestirnmen, beide SOhne das Studium der Mathematik
 eigreifen zu lassen" (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984,4).

 9 There are postcards from June 17,1881, and September 4, 1881, from Salomon to Julius in Hamburg,
 courtesy of the archive of the ΕΤΗ Zflrich (ISIL-Code: CH-000003-X Fonds-Hurwitz-A).

 10 At that time, this institution was called Kdniglich Bayerische Technische Hochschule MUnchen; since
 1970, it is the Technische University MUnchen.

 11 Since 1949 the University of Berlin has been called the Humboldt-UniversiUit zu Berlin.

 12 An excerpt of a letter from Klein to Adolf Hurwitz's father explaining the situation and the prospects
 for his son can be found in Rowe (2007,22).

 13 According to his later wife Hurwitz-Samuel (1984,6), he had to borrow a tailcoat from a fellow student
 for his doctoral viva.

 landes, erwacht. Von meinen SchUlern ist wohl besonders Hurwitz in Zurich und Dyck in MUnchen zu

 Fig. 1 Left portrait of Adolf Hurwitz. Right excerpt from Salomon Hurwitz's letter to Julius considering
 the new professorship of his brother

 Hurwitz's friends from this highly prolific period include the famous physicist Wil
 helm von Weber and the mathematician Moritz Abraham Stern, and while he had a

 good relationship with the first of these,16 the second one played a more important
 role in Adolf's life. Born in Frankfurt in 1807, Stern, although a protégé of Gauss,
 faced racist obstacles in his scientific career. He only became an ordinary profes

 sor at Gôttingen University in 1859, being the first unbaptized Jew to be appointed
 to an ordinary professorship in the rather anti-Semitic Prussia of the nineteenth

 century.17

 The year 1884 brought many changes. Stern retired and started to live in Bern,
 where his son was a professor of history, and Stern's chair at Gôttingen was filled by

 Klein. In the same year, Adolf Hurwitz moved to the University of Kônigsberg18 at the

 invitation of Lindemann, another pupil of Klein, who just had proved the transcendence
 of π and thereby the impossibility of squaring the circle. Lindemann became aware
 of Hurwitz because of his New representations of the proof of Weierstrass for the
 transcendence of e and π\19 Hurwitz obtained an extraordinary professorship (in
 German: Extraordinariat) comparable to an associate professorship in modern terms.

 This appointment was an overwhelming event for the whole family as a letter from
 his father to his brother Julius indicates:

 It is an extraordinary event, and we cannot thank destiny enough that our Adolf

 is so gifted, so acclaimed and is already recognized by the most important math
 ematicians as an excellent person (Fig. I).20

 Fig. 2 Left portrait of Julius Hurwitz. Right excerpt from his Reifezeugnis

 As the familial bonds of the Hurwitz family were always very close, one may assume

 that Julius Hurwitz shared his father's delight. Despite the disappointing working life
 in the banking business of his uncle, he never gave up his own academic plans and
 must have studied all the time. In retrospect, his sister-in-law, Ida Hurwitz, wrote in
 her biographical sketch (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984, 8):

 Since his uncle Adolph's death Max and Julius owned the bank 'Adolph M.
 Wertheimer's Nachf.' in Hanover. However, they felt uncomfortable in this busi

 ness. Hence, first Julius left in order to return to school at the age of 33 years

 and finish the school examination for studying Mathematics under supervision

 of his younger brother.21

 Subsequently Julius managed to get a so-called Reifezeugnis in Quakenbriick (not far
 from Bremen), which includes exams in subjects like history, geography, chemistry,
 and mathematics, as was necessary for studying at a university (Fig. 2).22 Then, in
 1890, at the age of 33, he finally followed his brother to Konigsberg.

 2 From Konigsberg to Switzerland

 Although the working conditions at Konigsberg must have been difficult, the students

 were excellent, among them the young Hermann Minkowski and David Hilbert. Adolf
 Hurwitz became not only their guide to mathematics but also a lifelong friend of both.

 At that time "[Adolf] Hurwitz was at the height of his powers and he opened up whole

 new mathematical vistas to Hilbert who looked up to him with admiration mixed with
 a tinge of envy" (Rowe 2007, 25). There is a letter from Hilbert to Klein with date

 March 4, 1891, ending with the sentence: "[Adolf] Hurwitz send you his regards. At

 anerkannt wird." Letter from Salomon to Julius, April 1, 1884, courtesy of the ΕΤΗ library (ISIL-Code:
 CH-000003-X Fonds-Hurwitz-A).

 21 "Seit dem Tode Onkel Adolphs waren Max u. Julius Inhaber des Bankgeschafts 'Adolph M. Wertheimer's
 Nachf.' in Hannover, fiihlten sich aber im Kaufmannstande nicht gliicklich. So trat zuerst Julius aus, setzte
 sich mit 33 Jahren nochmals auf die Schulbank, um das Abiturientenexamen nach zumachen und dann bei

 seinem jiingeren Bruder Mathematik zu studieren" (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984, 8).

 22 The certificate including several grades can still be found in the archive of Halle University (Rep. 21 Nr.
 162).

 the moment his eldest brother is staying here for a visit."23 and only a few weeks

 later, on June 11, Minkowski concludes a letter to Hilbert with "Kind regards to the

 Hurwitz brothers and the other mathematicians of Konigsberg [.. ,]".24 However, this

 does not completely explain the situation as it was regarded by Adolf Hurwitz's wife
 Ida, and it is not clear whether Julius was considered as one of those mathematicians.

 As a matter of fact, Julius edited some course notes of his brother Adolf's lectures at

 Konigsberg University.25

 Besides his mathematical dedication, Adolf Hurwitz was rooted in the academic

 social and cultural life of Konigsberg, and in this way got to know professors' families.

 After years of restraint, because of the fluctuating state of his health, in summer 1892,

 Adolf Hurwitz married Ida Samuel,26 a daughter of Simon Samuel, the professor of

 pathology, at the University of Konigsberg.

 More or less at the same time, Adolf Hurwitz was discussed with respect to two

 positions, Georg Frobenius' chair at the Eidgenossische Polytechnische Hochschule
 Zurich (in 1911 renamed in Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Ztirich and there

 fore in the sequel ΕΤΗ for short), a polytechnic, and Hermann Amandus Schwarz's

 chair at the University of Gottingen. Adolf Hurwitz accepted a call from Zurich and
 remained there for the rest of his life. One reason for choosing Zurich over the more

 prestigious Gottingen might have been that Klein's attempts to get Hurwitz for Got

 tingen turned out to be time-consuming and, as time went by, less promising; we refer
 to Rowe (2007) for the details. However, there might have been further reasons for

 Adolf Hurwitz's choice. In nineteenth century, Prussian prejudices against Jews and

 racism were common. When the founding of the Reich was followed by a financial

 crash and an economic depression, the atmosphere became unfriendly. Moreover, Hur

 witz's paternal friend Moritz Stern had meanwhile moved from Bern to Zurich and
 been made an honorary member of the local Society of Natural Scientists.27 Adolf
 Hurwitz's successor at Konigsberg was Hilbert who moved to Gottingen in 1895 on

 the promotion of Klein.28 Certainly, Adolf did not want to leave Zurich for Gottingen.
 When his brother followed the call of the ΕΤΗ Zurich, Julius accompanied him;

 his sister-in-law Ida wrote that:

 23 "[Adolf] Hurwitz lâsst Sie bestens griissen. Augenblicklich ist auch sein âl tester Brader hier bei ihm
 zum Besuch.", letter 63 in Frei (1985,73); actually, Max was the eldest, and Julius the second.

 24 "GriiBe bestens die Gebriider Hurwitz und die anderen Konigsberger Mathematiker in Riidenberg
 and Zassenhaus (1973,45).

 25 Those notes can still be found in the archives of the ΕΤΗ Ziirich (Hs 582; 52-53; 64-65; 96).

 26 1864-1951 ; author of a brief and very readable account (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984) on the Hurwitz family

 and her husband in particular.

 27 Stern died in 1894. Adolf Hurwitz and his colleague Ferdinand Rudio, a colleague from ΕΤΗ and former

 friend from his study times at Berlin, published the collected letters from Eisenstein to Stern (Hurwitz and

 Rudio 1894); this had been a wish of Stern and it affirms his close relation with Adolf Hurwitz.

 28 An excellent reading on this "Game of Mathematical Chairs" and the difficulties for Jewish mathemati
 cians at that time is Rowe's (2007) article as well as the correspondence (Frei 1985) between Hilbert and

 Klein.

 [Also] his brother Julius soon followed him to Zurich, where he wrote his doctoral

 thesis for which he had received the subject from his brother.29

 According to the curriculum vitae attached to his doctoral thesis Hurwitz (1895),

 Julius Hurwitz noted that he attended lectures by Stern in Zurich, which might be

 surprising since Stern had retired from Gôttingen in 1884.30 Even though his brother

 supported him, Julius Hurwitz returned to Germany for his final doctoral viva, more

 precisely, to the University of Halle-Wittenberg. Since the ΕΊΉ was permitted to

 supervise dissertations only in 1909, Julius could not write his thesis under his brother's

 supervision.31 One reason for his choice of Halle could have been that Schubert had

 received his doctorate from the University of Halle in 1870.32 Another reason could

 have been his brother's acquaintance with Albert Wangerin that had begun during his
 studies in Berlin around 1878.

 Indeed, Julius' thesis (Hurwitz 1895) at the University of Halle was officially super

 vised by Wangerin. Although his advisor is not widely known today, in the second

 half of the nineteenth century, he was a rather influential mathematician. Born 1844

 in Greifenberg, after his studies at Halle under Heine, Wangerin worked as a teacher

 before he became a professor at the University of Berlin in 1876; there he was respon

 sible for teaching beginners, duties which more prominent mathematicians such as

 Kronecker, Weierstrass, and Kummer tried to avoid. In 1882, Wangerin became pro

 fessor at the University of Halle, where he remained until his retirement in 1919 and

 where he died in 1933. During his life, Wangerin advised the remarkable number of

 53 students for their dissertation (Julius Hurwitz is number 28). The supervised topics

 range from calculus, in particular, differential equations, via analytic and differential

 geometry to mathematical physics; there are only two theses from number theory.33

 We do not know any details about Julius Hurwitz's time in Halle. The University

 of Halle-Wittenberg, however, is where Georg Cantor had been appointed in 1869
 on the promotion of Hermann Amandus Schwarz and where he obtained an extraor

 dinary professorship in 1872 and became an ordinary professor in 1879 on Heine's
 recommendation. Cantor was prominently involved in the foundation of the Deutsche

 Mathematiker Vereinigung (DMV), and he, as well as Klein, was also involved in orga

 nizing the first International Congress for Mathematicians in Zurich in 1897, which

 suggests some kind of approval for his famous, or rather, controversial foundations

 of set theory: "[Adolf] Hurwitz openly expressed his great admiration of Cantor and

 proclaimed him as one by whom the theory of functions has been enriched. Jacques

 29 "[Auch] sein Broder Julius folgte ihm bald nach Zttrich, wo er an der Doktorarbeit schrieb, deren Thema
 er von seinem Broder erhalten hatte" (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984,9).

 30 "Viros audivi illustrissimos: [...] Turici: Franel, Geiser, Hurwitz, Rudio, A. Stadler, Stem, von Wyss,
 Fr. Weber" (Hurwitz 1895,50).

 31 Usually, dissertation projects were officially ratified at the University of Zurich until the ΕΤΗ obtained

 Ml rights to supervise doctoral students independently in 1909; anyway, the relation between Julius and
 Adolf might have been too close.

 32 Schubert wrote his dissertation on enumerative geometry during his studies in Berlin, however, after the

 death of his teacher Gustav Magnus, he decided to finish his doctorate at the University of Halle without
 official supervisor; see Burau and Renschuch (1993) for further details.

 Hadamard expressed his opinion that the notions of the theory of sets were known

 and indispensable instruments" [as Johnson (1972, 17) wrote]. Adolf Hurwitz first

 met Cantor in summer 1888 when both spent some time in a group of mathematicians
 around Weierstrass in the Harz Mountains,34 and the relation between Cantor and the

 Hurwitz brothers seems to have been quite close. In a letter to Lemoine on July 7,

 1894, Cantor wrote the post-scriptum "Many thanks for the kind acceptance of the

 note of my pupil Hurwitz."35 Very likely, Cantor's pupil was Julius rather than his

 younger and by then well-established brother Adolf Hurwitz.

 As a professor in the mathematical department at Halle, Cantor had to review Julius'

 dissertation and his signature can be found on the relevant document. On July 13,1895,

 Julius Hurwitz officially finished his thesis. Besides Cantor's signature, it bears the

 dedication "My dear brother and distinguished teacher Herr Prof. Dr. A. Hurwitz."36

 Moreover, he expressed his gratitude to his younger brother for "the many pieces of

 advice with which he had supported this work."37 Remarkably, the topic of Julius'

 dissertation thesis is not only close to his brother's treatment of complex continued

 fractions, according to the official description of his advisor Wangerin, it is even based

 on a published article of Adolf Hurwitz. He wrote:

 Herr J. Hurwitz examines, following a published work in Acta Mathematica,

 volume XI, by his brother, Prof. A. Hurwitz in Zurich, a certain kind of continued

 fraction expansion of complex numbers.38

 In his Jahrbuch iiberdie Forstschritte der Mathematik review, Hurwitz (1894a) himself
 wrote about his brother Julius' dissertation:

 The author examines in the present paper a certain kind of a continued fraction

 expansion of complex numbers from a similar point of view as the referee took

 as a basis for handling certain other continued fraction expansions of real and

 complex numbers.39

 With a twinkling eye, this summary may be seen in the light of a rough quotation by

 Adolf Hurwitz saying that "A PhD dissertation is a paper by the professor written under

 34 "Im Sommer 1888 verbrachte er [Adolf Hurwitz] auf Anregung von Prof. Mittag-Leffler in Stockholm,

 aggravating circumstances" (cf. Krantz 2005, 24). His mathematical diaries (Hurwitz
 1972) contain several pages with explicit computations of a preliminary version of
 Julius' thesis with date 4 November 1894 (Fig. 3).40

 It seems that at this early date, Adolf Hurwitz provided a few suggestions to his
 brother about what could be considered in the final version of his thesis. In the end,

 Julius' thesis must have made a good impression. In the further course of description,
 Wangerin emphasized that Julius Hurwitz worked diligently, efficiently, and in partic
 ular independently.41 Besides Wangerin, the examination committee consisted of the

 dean Prof. Haym, Prof. Dorn (physics), and Prof. Vaihinger (philosophy). The minutes
 of the examination42 record that Julius was questioned not only about mathematics,
 but also about Carnot's theory of heat, the philosophy of Leibniz, and other subjects.
 Finally, all examiners agreed on the grade magna cum laude.

 Shortly after his disputation, Julius Hurwitz returned to Switzerland. Already in

 1896, he became a member of the 'Naturforschende Gesellschaft' in Basel and in

 the same year he was lecturing as PrivatdocentAi at the University of Basel, the
 first university in Switzerland, founded in 1460. One of the contacts the Hurwitz

 brothers could have had in Basel was Karl von der Miihll who worked in Leipzig until
 1889 before he was appointed a professorship in Basel. It is astonishing how quickly
 Julius submitted the necessary Habilitation thesis "Ûber die Reduction der binâren
 quadratischen Formen mit complexen Coeffizienten und Variablen"; it must have been

 written in the same year 1896 although it was still far from being published. On June

 2, 1896 the examination board of the department in Basel found that "the petitioner
 became zealously and skillfully acquainted with the field of mathematics in a short
 time."44 In the following colloquium on June 17, Julius was not only questioned about

 number and function theory, but also had to deliver a short talk. Despite criticism of

 "the lack of clarity and clear mastery of presentation," the examination board decided

 to support his ambitions. In a letter to the senior civil servant Dr. Zutt, the Regent says

 that he had decided to grant the "Venia docendi"45 to Julius Hurwitz.46 So finally, six

 years after being permitted to study at a university, at the age of 39, Julius Hurwitz

 officially became an academic independent of his younger brother.

 Interestingly, his public Habilitation lecture on October 27, 1896, was about "the

 infinite in mathematics," a topic related to Cantor's famous controversial work.47 But it

 was only in July 1899 that Julius finished the summary of dissertation and Habilitation,

 and it took another two years before it was printed as Hurwitz (1902). In any case, it

 is remarkable that both Julius and Adolf Hurwitz realized their habilitation in a very
 short time.

 Emigration turned out to be a good choice for Adolf Hurwitz too. Firstly, in Switzer

 land, there were fewer resentments against Jews than in Prussia. Moreover, in Zurich,

 there was a rich academic life with a polytechnic school, the ΕΤΗ, and a university as

 well as a mathematical society. While in the beginning, the ΕΤΗ had been a stepping

 stone for young researchers to obtain better positions at respectable German universi

 ties (e.g., Dedekind, H. A. Schwarz, Frobenius), the situation improved quickly thanks

 to the tight collaboration with the established University of Zurich. Of course, there

 was also a certain competition between the two institutions.48 As with the situation

 in Kônigsberg, there were excellent students in Zurich. For instance, around 1900,

 Albert Einstein applied for an assistanceship with Adolf Hurwitz; however, as Ein

 stein reported, Hurwitz must have been puzzled that a student who was never ever

 seen in the mathematical seminar asked for such a position; according to Einstein,

 for a physicist, it suffices to know and apply the elementary mathematical notions.49

 About a decade later, Albert played chamber music together with the Hurwitz fam

 ily.50 The physicist Max Born was another student of Adolf Hurwitz around 1902/03;

 he wrote about his teacher Hurwitz: "Once when I missed a point in a lecture I went

 to Hurwitz afterwards and asked for a private explanation. He invited me (...) to his

 house and gave us a series of private lectures on some chapters of the theory of func

 tions of complex variables, in particular on Mittag-Leffler's theorem, which I still

 consider as one of the most impressive experiences of my student life. I carefully

 worked out the whole course, including these private appendices, and my notebook

 was used by Courant when he, many years later and after Hurwitz' death, published

 45 The Swiss version of the "venia legendi."

 46 "Hochgeachteter Herr, auf Antrag der philosophischen Fakultât hat Ε. E. Regenz in ihrer gestrigen
 Sitzung beschlossen, Herm Dr. phil Julius Hurwitz die venia docendi fUr Mathematik zu verleihen. Herr

 Hurwitz hat sich durch eine Habilitationsschrift und durch ein Colloquium in der Weise ausgewiesen, daB

 his well-known book ..." [cf. Rowe 2007, 29; the book in question is Courant and
 Hurwitz (1992)].

 These various activities culminated in the first International Congress for Mathe

 maticians held at Zurich in 1897. Adolf Hurwitz was not only involved in its organi

 zation, but, together with Klein, Peano, and Poincaré, he was one of the distinguished

 invited speakers giving a talk on recent developments in complex analysis and the

 impact of Cantor's set theory.51 Julius Hurwitz also attended the congress at Zurich,

 but he did not attend the next one in Paris nor any other International Congress (neither
 did Adolf).

 In 1901, Julius Hurwitz had to give up his position at the University of Basel due to

 illness. The protocols of the sessions of the philosophical faculty do not report what

 kind of illness, and it is impossible to decide whether this might be the reason why

 no other mathematical papers of his can be found. Four years later Julius moved to

 Lucerne, where he stayed until 1916 when he accompanied his companion52 Franz

 Sieckmeyer to Germany. The brief note 'Deutschland, Krieg' in the file in the municipal

 archives of Sieckmeyer suggests that this return was not of his own free will. Referring

 to their last meeting, Ida Hurwitz wrote

 [...] Julius was visiting us after a long break (he had followed his companion

 Franz Sieckmeyer to Freiburg i/Br., where he served in a military hospital). Also

 Julius was suffering for many years (heart disease and arteriosclerosis), but at

 this last meeting, which was rather unexpected for both brothers, Adolf made a

 far more sickly impression.53

 Some years before, in 1905, one of Adolf Hurwitz's kidneys had been removed; later,

 his second kidney ceased to work properly. Thereafter, his life became more calm and

 isolated than before.54 In May 1919, Adolf Hurwitz finished his last major project, his

 monograph (Hurwitz 1919) on the number theory of quaternions based on his lectures

 at the Konigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Gottingen in 1896.

 On June 2/3, 1919, Julius returned to Lucerne, where he checked into the Hotel

 des Alpes located directly on the famous Lake Lucerne. Somedays later, he wanted

 to leave for Lugano55 but although his notice of departure can be found in the city's
 records, it never came to pass.

 51 Adolf Hurwitz had previously supported the forerunner of the ICM at Chicago's World's Columbian

 Exposition in 1893 by submitting a contribution in absentia; see Lehto (1998, 5), resp. www.mathunion.
 org/ICM/.

 52 In German: Gesellschafter.

 53 "[...] war Julius nach langer Pause wieder einmal bei uns zu Besuch (er war seinem Gesellschafter Franz

 Sieckmeyer nach Freiburg ί/Br. gefolgt, wo dieser Lazarettdienst leistete). Auch Julius war seit Jahren sehr

 leidend (Herzleiden und Arterienverkalkung), auch machte bei diesem letzten Zusammensein, auf welches

 beide Briider wohl kaum mehr gerechnet hatten, Adolf den weitaus krânklicheren Eindruck." (Hurwitz
 Samuel 1984,13)

 54 Pôlya (1987,25) wrote "His health was not too good so when we walked it had to be on level ground,

 not always easy in the hilly paît of Zurich, and if we went uphill, we walked very slowly." Pôlya at that
 time was around 30 years old whereas Adolf in the mid-fifties.

 On 15 June in Lucerne, during one of the frequent heart attacks he endured,

 Julius suddenly closed his eyes forever at the age of 61. [Adolf] H. accepted this

 news, which was delivered him with the greatest caution, with complete sincerity,

 praising the destiny of his beloved brother, who had overcome everything now,

 and longing for the same for himself.56

 The health of Adolf Hurwitz deteriorated more slowly. As late as October 28,1919,

 he ran a seminar at home where his family was "listening at the door admiring the

 control and clarity with which he knew how to talk."57 Somedays later, on November

 18, 1919, he died in Zurich of kidney failure at 60 years of age. Life expectancy

 was just around 54 years at that time. All the three brothers, Max, Julius, and Adolf

 Hurwitz, were buried next to each other in an family grave at the Sihlfeld cemetery in
 the center of Zurich.58

 Adolf Hurwitz's collected papers (Hurwitz 1932) were edited by Pôlya and appeared

 in 1932.59 The ΕΤΗ holds the complete rack of 31 mathematical diaries (Hurwitz

 1972) of Adolf Hurwitz ranging from 1882 until 1919. During his scientific life, he

 supervised altogether at least 23 doctoral students,60 There is much more to say about

 Adolf Hurwitz's life and research.61 For instance, the detailed obituary W.H.Y. (1922)

 published by the London Mathematical Society makes a good reading; Adolf Hurwitz

 had been an honorary member of this society since 1913.62 Curiously, the author of

 the obituary (W.H.Y. 1922) signed just with his intitials W.H.Y., so we may only guess

 that it was William Henry Young, the president of the London Mathematical Society

 from 1922 to 1924. When dealing with Adolf Hurwitz's work on continued fractions,
 W.H.Y. wrote

 His papers on continued fractions and on the approximate representation of
 irrational numbers are also very original, as well as curious. (W.H.Y. 1922, Li)

 56 "Am 15. Juni schloss Julius in Luzern bei einem der hâufigen Herzanfalle, die er erlitt, ganz plôtzlich

 seine Augen fur immer. [Adolf] H. nahm die Nachricht, die ihm mit grôBter Vorsicht beigebracht wurde,

 voll Ergebung auf, das Geschick des Bruders preisend, der nun ailes uberstanden habe, und fiir sich selber
 das Gleiche ersehnend." (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984,13)

 57 "[wir,] an der Tiir Lauschenden bewunderten die Beherrschtheit und Klarheit, mit der er vorzutragen
 vermochte." (Hurwitz-Samuel 1984,14)

 58 The family grave in field D had number 81201 ; the grave was removed in 2000.

 59 In Pôlya (1987,25), George Pôlya wrote: "My connection with Hurwitz was deeper and my debt to him

 greater than to any other colleague." It was indeed on Adolf Hurwitz's invitation that Pôlya was offered an

 appointment as Privatdozent at Zurich.

 60 According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project http://genealogy.math, all within the period 1896—
 1919; however, in his collected works (Hurwitz 1932, 754, vol. II) there are just 21 listed. Among his

 pupils one can find the later professors Gustave du Pasquier at the Université de Neuchâtel, Eugène Châte
 lain, Alfred Kienast, Émile Marchand, and Ernst Meissner, all at ΕΤΗ Zurich, as well as Kerim Erim,

 who obtained his doctorate at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and later became a professor at the

 University of Istanbul.

 61 Very good accounts on Adolf Hurwitz's life and work are given by his wife Hurwitz-Samuel (1984) and
 Frei (1995).

 62 It is interesting to notice that he was also an honorary member of the mathematical societies of Hamburg

 and Kharkov, and a corresponding member of the Academia di Lincei at Rome (which is rather different

 from the image of a couch potato that one could have in view of his absence from International Congresses
 outside Zurich).

 Complex continued fractions 511

 But he did not explain what he meant by curious.

 In the following section, we shall give a short account of Adolf Hurwitz's work

 on continued fractions in general, and complex continued fractions in particular. The

 largely forgotten work of Julius Hurwitz on complex continued fractions will be dis

 cussed in the subsequent section.

 3 Complex continued fractions according to Adolf Hurwitz

 Continued fractions of rational and real irrational numbers have been studied for cen

 turies. Of course, continued fractions are closely related to the Euclidean algorithm.

 For instance, it is said that Pythagoras' pupil Hippasos may have discovered the incom

 mensurability of the diagonal of a square, i.e., the irrationality of \/2, by means of

 a geometric version of the Euclidean algorithm giving the regular continued fraction
 expansion63

 /—.111

 V2 =1 + - + --F-H .

 2 2 2

 In the sixth century, the Indian mathematician Àryabhata used finite continued frac
 tions to solve linear diophantine equations (cf. Brezinski 1991, 29). In the sixteenth

 century, the Italian mathematicians Bombelli and Cataldi gave first examples of infinite
 continued fractions [as for, e.g., \/Ï3; see Brezinski (1991, 61)]. To mention another

 historical benchmark, the first continued fraction for π was found by the English

 school, when Lord Brouncker gave the semi-regular expansion

 4 1 l2 32 52 72
 - = f + T + T+ Y + Y + "·

 in response to Wallis' infinite product (Dutka 1982,116).64 The first systematic theory

 of regular continued fractions is often attributed to the Dutch astronomer, physicist,

 and mathematician Christiaan Huygens, motivated by his work on a gear driven model

 of the solar system. Later Euler, Lambert, Lagrange, Legendre, Galois, and Gauss

 made significant contributions to the further development of the theory of continued

 fractions. More information about the history of continued fractions can be found in

 Brezinski (1991). The first classic and yet standard reference for continued fractions

 is the treatise 'Die Lehre von den Kettenbriichen' (Perron 1913) by Oskar Perron (and

 we refer to this source for definitions, details, and fundamental facts). This wonderful

 monograph covers both the arithmetic and approximation theory of continued frac
 tions, and the third edition from 1954 includes a brief introduction to Adolf Hurwitz's

 approach to extending the theory of continued fractions from real numbers to complex
 numbers.

 63 For details about the various appearances of continued fractions in ancient Greek mathematics we refer
 to Fowler (1990).

 512 Ν. M. R. Oswald, J. J. Steuding

 Even before his time in Kônigsberg, Adolf Hurwitz had deep interest in continued

 fractions, as the following entry in his first mathematical diary (Hurwitz 1972, 16)
 shows:

 The theory of continued fractions having units as numerators and algebraic inte

 gers as denominators play a crucial role in the theory of functions as well as in

 number theory. In the case of numbers α+hi and α-1-hp (i = v'-T, Ρ =

 there is in principle no difficulty in developing a corresponding theory in view of

 the possibility of Euclid's method for determining the greatest common divisor.

 Nevertheless, a careful and thorough foundation of such a theory appears to be

 of great value, for example, for solving diophantine equations of second degree

 for the corresponding number systems. This is a good doctoral thesis for a young
 and ambitious mathematician.65

 This entry bears no date; however, it cannot have been made later than April 13,1883

 (as one may deduce from a later entry with this date); probably, the entry is from 1882.

 It took a few years that young Adolf Hurwitz returned to continued fractions during

 his time at Kônigsberg around 1886/1887.66

 As a matter of fact, Adolf Hurwitz picked up this idea a few years later by extending

 the continued fraction expansion to the nearest integer for real numbers to complex

 numbers. Given a real number χ € [-|, 5), its continued fraction to the nearest integer
 is of the form

 ei . «2 . «3 .
 x = 1 Η + ··· ,

 a 1 ai a-i

 where = ±1, an e N, and en+an > 2.67 It is not difficult to see that a real number

 χ has a finite nearest integer continued fraction if, and only if, χ is rational. Probably

 Minnigerode ( 1873) was the first person to consider continued fractions to the nearest

 66 According to his mathematical diary no. 5, February 1886-March 1888, pp. 49-69; Hs 582:5 (Hurwitz

 1972,49-69). Unfortunately, there is no date attached, but a later entry has date May 1,1887.

 67 In modern mathematical language this convergent expansion is obtained by iteration of the mapping

 χ h>· Τ χ := T(x) := | - for χ Φ 0 and Γ0 = 0, where LzJ denotes the integer part of ζ (which is

 unique provided ζ - \ £ Z); here, the subsequent partial quotients are given by an := [7"'1""1 \x |J and the

 sign en = e equals the sign of Tn~^\x\. The first iteration leads to

 rational integer as an alternative method for solving Pell's equation; Roberts (1884)

 developed a related approach independently about a decade later.

 Hurwitz (1888) extended Minnigerode's approach by considering complex numbers

 Ζ — x+iy instead of real numbers and replacing rational integers by Gaussian integers;

 here and in the sequel, the imaginary unit i = Τ denotes the square root of—1 in the

 complex upper half-plane. It is not difficult to see that this yields a continued fraction

 expansion with partial quotients in the ring Z[ij. By analogy to the real situation,

 a complex number has a finite continued fraction to the nearest Gaussian integer if,

 and only if, it is a rational Gaussian number. The proof relies on a variation of the

 Euclidean algorithm in Z[i']. However, Adolf Hurwitz was considering a far more

 general situation.

 Let 5 be any set of complex numbers such that (i) sum, difference, and product of

 any two elements in 5 belong to 5, (ii) any finite domain of the complex plane contains

 only finitely many points from S (from which it already follows that besides zero there

 is no point in the open unit disk inside 5), and, finally, (iii) 1 e 5. Starting from some

 complex number x, Adolf Hurwitz built up the following chain of equations:

 which one can continue ad infinitum if all Xj Φ 0. Supposing further that (iv) the nth

 convergent &· := αο + ^· + ^· Η differs from ζ by a quantity less than a
 fixed constant multiple of Hurwitz (1888) obtained the following

 in

 and the sequence of convergents ^ converge with limit χ (which cannot be an element
 ofS). Moreover, if χ is the solution of a quadratic equation with coefficients from S,

 then the sequence of the x„ takes only finitely many values.

 His proof of the above theorem is more or less straightforward. We give a sketch

 of his reasoning. Firstly, by induction,

 and convergence follows from assumption (iv) (respectively, showing \q„\ > \qn-\|).

 To go on, Hurwitz considered for a quadratic irrational the corresponding irreducible

 quadratic equation Ax2 + Bx + C = 0 and deduced another irreducible quadratic
 equation for xn+\ with the same discriminant D — B2—4AC and coefficients bounded

 by an explicit quantity depending on |\/ï>| such that only finitely many values for xn+\
 are possible. If in addition the numbers an are taken according a certain rule, e.g., as

 nearest Gaussian integer, then the sequence of the xn and, henceforth, the sequence of

 partial quotients an are eventually periodic (Fig. 4). For regular continued fractions of
 real numbers, this is a celebrated theorem of Lagrange (1770,136); the same reasoning
 holds for continued fractions to the nearest integer, and even in the case of complex

 numbers χ when the partial quotients are taken to be the nearest Gaussian integers. In

 his proof, Adolf Hurwitz gives a reference to Hermite (1885).

 Concerning Adolf Hurwitz's assumptions on the "system" S [which is what he

 called a set of numbers satisfying conditions (i)-(iii)], it should be mentioned that S is

 in fact a ring with the additional assumption that it does not contain any accumulation
 point. Actually, Adolf Hurwitz wrote in a footnote that "A theory of such number
 systems has been developed in the well-known works of Kronecker and Dedekind,
 particularly in the case of algebraic numbers. Cf. in particular Supplement XI to
 Dirichlet's lectures on number theory. Third edition."68 Dedekind's supplements to
 Dirichlet's ( 1879) lectures deal with the arithmetic in algebraic number fields and gave

 birth to such fruitful concepts as rings, ideals, and modules; however, the notion of a
 ring came only in the 1890s with Hilbert's work on his Zahlbericht (cf. Dieudonné and
 Guérindon 1985, 116). In 1894, Adolf Hurwitz (1894c) published a note on principal
 ideals (probably influenced by Hilbert's work on the Zahlbericht). Outside algebraic
 number theory rings and their substructures became widely accepted only with Emmy

 Noether's modern algebra. Being a discrete additive subgroup, also a two-dimensional
 lattice in the complex plane serves well for a system S as considered by Adolf Hurwitz

 provided that 1 is a lattice point. The notion of a lattice had been established in the

 important work of Hermann Minkowski in the 1890s, whose Geometry of Numbers is
 based on lattices; previously Eisenstein, Liouville, Jacobi, and Weierstrass had used
 lattices when dealing with elliptic functions.

 As already mentioned, in Hurwitz (1888, 197) Adolf Hurwitz applied his general

 theorem to the case when 5 is a ring of Gaussian integers Z[i], He furthermore wrote

 68 "Eine Théorie solcher Zahlsysteme ist in den bekannten Arbeiten von Kronecker und Dedekind,
 vorzugsweise fur den Fall algebraischer Zahlen entwickelt. Vgl. insbesondere das XI. Supplement zu
 Dirichlet's Vorlesungen iiber Zahlentheorie. Dritte Auflage" (Hurwitz 1888, 187).

 Complex continued fractions 515

 Apart from the here considered continued fraction expansion in the range of

 complex numbers m + ni there exist more for which the above theorem holds,

 however, I do not want to go on with this here.69

 Another continued fraction expansion with partial quotients in the set of Gaussian

 integers was studied by Adolf Hurwitz's brother Julius as the main topic of his dis

 sertation; we shall investigate this in detail in the following section. Moreover, Adolf

 Hurwitz mentioned that his approach could be used to build up a complex theory of

 the Pell equation t2 - Du2 = 1 where D is a given number and solutions t and u are to

 be complex integers. This topic also is not unrelated to what had been considered by

 Julius. Finally, in Hurwitz (1888, 197) Adolf Hurwitz studied the ring of Eisenstein

 integers Ζ [ρ] associated with a primitive cube root of unity ρ = j(-l + i'V3) and
 pointed out that his continued fraction expansion to the nearest Eisenstein integer is

 different from what one would obtain with Bachmann's Euclidean algorithm for Q(p)

 in Bachman (1872,189). Further applications are possible and were considered by his

 contemporaries (as we shall indicate in the final section).

 Klein's influence is apparent in much of Adolf Hurwitz's work; however, Hurwitz's

 research on continued fractions and related topics from diophantine approximation

 seems to have independent roots. Both of his teachers, Schubert and Klein, included

 continued fractions in some of their writings, namely the textbooks Schubert (1902)

 and Klein (1908), but these sources are addressed to beginners in mathematics and do

 not indicate any deeper relation to this topic.

 What might have been the motivation for Adolf Hurwitz to start a new direction

 of research and investigate continued fractions? His friend from Gottingen, Moritz

 Stern, had received a doctorate on the theory of continued fractions Stern (1829),

 being the first candidate examined by Gauss (cf. Rowe 1986,429). For several years,

 after the work of Euler and Lambert and the investigations of the French school

 around Lagrange and Legendre, Stern had been the leading expert in this subject;
 he published quite a few papers on continued fractions in Crelle's Journal, and his

 Lehrbuch der Algebraischen Analysis (Stern 1860) contains a whole chapter on this
 topic.

 In fact, continued fractions were a major topic of investigation in the eighteenth

 and nineteenth centuries. The well-known contributions of Euler, Lagrange, and others

 focussed on arithmetical questions as, for example, solving Pell's equation or peri

 odic expansions, and Gauss' research marks the beginning of the metrical theory of

 continued fractions. First results in the nineteenth century highlight analytic questions

 about convergence and divergence, e.g., the Seidel-Stern convergence theorem due to

 Seidel (1846) and (independently) Stern (1848). Building on previous work of Stern

 (1860), Stolz (1885) investigated periodic continued fractions with complex entries

 with respect to convergence; this is now known as the Stern-Stolz divergence theo

 rem (for details we refer to Lorentzen and Waadeland (1992)). The very first complex

 continued fractions can be found implicitly in the general approach of Jacobi; see

 Jacobi (1868), published in 1868 17 years after Jacobi's death.

 Adolf Hurwitz's contribution (Hurwitz 1888) on complex continued fractions was

 submitted on November 29, 1887, to the journal Acta Mathematica and published

 there in March 1888. It seems that this paper is the first to study complex contin

 ued fractions in a systematic way. At this time, there was another study of this topic

 by the Italian mathematician Michelangeli (1887), and in a letter (Bianchi 1959, 99)

 to his friend Bianchi from January 12, 1891, Adolf Hurwitz asked about Michelan

 geli's (1887) work on continued fractions. However, Hurwitz's results seem to go far

 beyond Michelangeli.70 We cannot be sure whether Adolf Hurwitz was aware of previ

 ous results such as those of Jacobi or Stolz mentioned above. We may only speculate

 that he could have got a rigorous introduction to real continued fractions from his

 friend Stern; any research on complex continued fractions might have been unknown

 to him. During his studies in Munich, Adolf Hurwitz attended courses by Seydel

 and Pringsheim, both well-known for their contributions to the theory of continued

 fractions; however, their research went in a different direction at that time, although

 that does not exclude the possibility that continued fractions were a topic of their

 courses and interests.71 It is a fact that Hurwitz did not cite any work on continued

 fractions apart from Minnigerode's (Minnigerode 1873) paper, even not Lagrange's

 or Galois' theorems on periodic continued fraction expansions, which might be from

 ignorance or curious (to use the words of W.H.Y.). However, this canniness in cit

 ing other mathematician's works is quite common in the nineteenth century (and

 applies to Stern and Stolz as well). Summing up, Adolf Hurwitz's point of view is

 rather different from that of Jacobi or Stolz—namely, arithmetical, not analytical—

 and it led to a revival of the arithmetical theory of continued fractions. His approach
 generalizes Minnigerode's approach from real to complex numbers, and there cer

 tain phenomena arise with complex continued fractions that do not occur in the real

 case.

 We briefly mention further work of Adolf Hurwitz on continued fractions. In Hur

 witz ( 1889), he introduced a new type of semi-regular continued fractions72 and studied

 them with respect to equivalent numbers and quadratic forms. These so-called singular

 continued fractions are a mixture of the regular continued fraction and the continued

 fraction to the nearest integer.73

 70 At least if the summery of Vivanti in the Jahrbuch liber die Fortschritte der Mathematik (Vivanti 2005)

 provides an appropriate picture of Michelangeli (1887). Unfortunately, the authors were not able to find

 any copy of Michelangeli's work.

 Masse fesselten, hdrte er bei Gustav Bauer, Seydel, Pringsheim, Brill und Beetz. Bauer u. Pringsheim trat

 73 To explain that we recall Nakada's α-continued fraction from Nakada (1981). Given a fixed real number

 α 6 [\, 1], the α-continued fraction of a real number χ e Ia := [α- 1, a) is a convergent finite or infinite

 semi-regular continued fraction of the form *=2^ + ^ + ···+^ + ···. where the partial quotients a„

 Complex continued fractions 517

 In Hurwitz (1894b), Adolf Hurwitz showed that for any irrational real number χ

 there is an infinite sequence of rational numbers such that their distance to χ is

 strictly less than 1/(V5q%), and this bound is best possible; this improves upon a

 previous result due to Hermite (1885) and is the starting point for the investigations

 on the Markov spectrum.74 His method of proof is based on the regular continued

 fraction expansion, and the result can be found in diophantine textbooks under the

 keyword "Hurwitz's approximation theorem" (although often with a proof using the
 Farey sequence, avoiding continued fractions). There are some refinements of this

 result, e.g., Borel's (1903) work. Hurwitz's (1894b) paper provides a link between

 the Farey sequence and continued fractions of irrationals with an application to the

 Pell equation. Finally, in Hurwitz (1896), he generalized some classical results due to

 Euler and Lambert on e and related values to more general continued fractions with

 partial quotients which form an arithmetic progression.

 This impressive list of publications shows that continued fractions played a central

 role in Adolf Hurwitz's investigations. This is confirmed by Hilbert's (1921, 163)

 obituary where he wrote that Hurwitz had an affection for the theory of arithmetic

 continued fractions (in contrast to questions about convergence when considered as

 functions of the partial quotients). It is interesting to notice that Hilbert stresses among

 Adolf Hurwitz's various results on continued fractions the paper in which he realized

 the generalization from real to complex numbers.75

 In texts about Adolf Hurwitz's life and work, it is often mentioned that he benefited

 greatly from his teacher Felix Klein. It is well-known that Klein himself had a very

 high opinion of the triangle Hurwitz, Hilbert, and Minkowski at Kônigsberg; in his

 treatise on the development of mathematics in the nineteenth century, Klein (1926)

 attributed the description "aphorist" to Hurwitz and considered him as a "problem

 solver" writing "complete works," whereas Minkowski was a theory builder who found

 new links between a "geometrical view" and "number theoretical problems."76 This is

 characters (Dyson 2009). As is well-known, Minkowski remained in contact with

 both Hurwitz and Hilbert after their common time at Kônigsberg, with the first of

 them during his time in Zurich from 1896 until 1902 and with the latter at Gôttingen

 from 1902 until his untimely death in 1909. It seems that Minkowski and Hilbert were

 closer than the other vertex of this unequal triangle.

 4 Complex continued fractions according to Julius Hurwitz

 Adolf's support is emphasized on the very first page of Julius' dissertation (Hurwitz

 1895), where he wrote that "the thesis follows in aim and method two publications

 due to Herr. A. Hurwitz to whom I owe the encouragement for this investigation."77

 The two mentioned publications are Hurwitz (1888,1889). Interestingly, it is his elder
 brother Adolf Hurwitz who wrote a review in Jahrbuch iiber die Forstschritte der

 Mathematik (Hurwitz 1894a) about his brother's doctorate starting as follows:

 The complex plane may be tiled by straight lines χ + y = υ, χ - y = v, where

 ν ranges through all positive and negative odd integers, into infinitely many

 squares. The centers of the squares are complex integers divisible by 1 -Ihi. For

 an arbitrary complex number x, one may develop the chain of equations

 χ=α-—, x\ -a\ x„=a„ —,... (1)

 deutlich, daB Geometrie und Zahlentheorie keineswegs einander ausschlieBen, sofem man sich in der

 77 "Die Arbeit schliesst sich, nach Ziel und Methode, eng an die nachstehend genannten zwei Abhandlungen

 des Herrn A. Hurwitz an, dem ich auch die Anregung zu dieser Untersuchung verdanke."

 Xj. In the case when x,· lies on the boundary of a square, some further rule has

 to be applied which we ignore here for the sake of brevity. For χ the chain of
 equations (1) leads to a continued fraction expansion χ = (α, αϊ α„,χ„+ι)
 further investigation of which is the topic of this work.78

 Complex continued fractions 519

 At first glance, Julius' expansion could be mistaken as a specification of the general

 complex continued fraction investigated by his younger brother. The key difference is

 a modification of the set of possible partial quotients. While Adolf Hurwitz allowed

 all Gaussian integers, Julius restricted this set to all multiples of 1 + / which is—in
 modern language—the ideal generated by a := 1 + i, i.e., (a) = (1 + i)Z[i], within
 the ring Z[t ]. It should be noticed that 1 is not an element of this ideal; hence, condition

 iii) of Adolf Hurwitz's setting for his "system" S of partial quotients is not fulfilled.

 Geometrically speaking, Julius' set of partial quotients is a sublattice (1 + /)Z[/] of

 the lattice formed by the Gaussian integers. This leads to a tiling of the complex plane

 and enables consequently the definition of a "nearest" partial quotient an e (1+/)Z[Z]

 to each complex number χ e C. Proceeding in a similar way as in the case of Adolf
 Hurwitz's case one finds

 1 1 111

 XI ax-± ax a2 a3 - ±

 ι — — "V ι

 and so on and so forth with partial quotients an == 0 mod 1 + i ; here, we have replaced

 a by ao and χ by xo in (1) in order to follow Julius' notation closely.79

 A natural question is which complex numbers have a finite continued fraction

 expansion? Of course, the answer may depend on the type of continued fraction

 expansion, and indeed, there are differences between the continued fraction pro
 posed by Adolf Hurwitz and the one investigated by Julius. For Adolf Hurwitz's

 continued fractions, the expansion for a complex number χ terminates if, and only if,

 χ € Q(/), as follows from the analogue of the Euclidean algorithm for the ring of inte
 gers Ζ[i]. However, the situation in the case of Julius Hurwitz-continued fractions is
 different:

 1 + 8/ 1 1 1
 5 + 7/ ~ 1 - ι + -2/ + -4'

 18 1 1 1 1 11
 = - 4 1 1 1 1
 95 6 -2 2 -2 -2 2'

 whereas

 1 + 7/ 1 1 1 1

 5 + 7/ ~ 1 - / + -2/ + 3 + i + 0 + "

 17 _ i _1_ _1_ J_ J_
 95 " 6 + -2 + -2 + -2 + + '

 79 Actually, each iteration is determined by the transform Τ which is defined by Γ(0) = 0 and T(x) :=

 j — [ j] otherwise, in analogy with the approach of his younger brother; here the bracket [x] is given

 by [λ] := [u + jja + [υ + \\ci for χ = ua + vâ with a = 1 + i, and Τ maps the square

 X := [x = ua + vâ : - j < «, υ < 5} onto X. What turns up is an expansion of a unique complex

 continued fiaction χ=αο + ^- + ^· + a^Tix- This is modern notation and is different from what can
 be found in Julius' dissertation Hurwitz (1895).

 here the dots indicate that the continued fraction expansion does not terminate. These

 examples are related to the case of iterates of ζ coming from the complementary set

 1 + (1 + i)Z[i] of partial quotients; here, we observe

 1 1 1

 , = T3J + ô + ô + ···

 which shows that there is no convergence in such cases. Generalizing from these

 examples, Julius Hurwitz arrived at the following

 Theorem The continued fraction expansion of the first kind of a complex rational

 number finishes with a partial quotient divisible by 1 + i if, and only if, after canceling

 all common factors, neither the numerator nor the denominator are divisible by 1+z'.80

 The formulation of this theorem might be confusing. As a matter of fact, the Julius

 Hurwitz-continued fraction for a complex number χ with all partial quotients from

 (1 + i)Z[i] is finite if, and only if, χ = f with coprime a,b € Z[i] satisfying either
 a s 1, b s 0 mod a or a = 0, b = 1 mod a. In addition, one may allow a final partial

 quotient from the complement of (1 + z')Z[i] in order to have a finite expansion for

 all complex rationals. With the notion of a continued fraction of the first kind, we

 mean the expansion given above; in a later part of his thesis, Julius also considers the

 analogue of continued fractions of the second type as introduced by his brother.

 Here, we essentially reproduce Julius' proof of his theorem. Obviously, all finite

 expansions with partial quotients from (1 + z)Z[z] lead to complex rationals. In order

 to prove the converse implication, one may expand a given Gaussian rational number

 Χο = ττϊί = % such that

 since |χι| > 1, it follows that |μι 1 > |μ2|. This leads to x\ = j^· = αϊ - ^ and again

 Ml
 — = μιαο - μ =: μι 6 Z[»];
 xi

 LL2
 — = μ2αι - μι =: μ3 6 Z[i].
 χ2

 Going on we obtain a sequence of Gaussian integers μ„ such that any subsequent

 pair satisfies |μΒ+ι| > |μ«+2ΐ· Consequently, the norms of the μ„ form a strictly

 monotonie decreasing sequence of positive integers; hence, there exists an index m
 such that μ„+ι φ0 = μη. This goes along with = xm = am. If μ and μι are

 coprime in the Euclidean ring Z[i], then the Euclidean algorithm provides

 Μπ — β/ιβη+Ι ~ βη+2 Κ)Γ 1 = 1 m,

 μ = αομι - μ2,

 Mm = amMm+l>

 80 "Die Kettenbruch-Entwicklung erster Ait einer complexen rationalen Zahl endigt dann und nur dann
 mit einem nicht durch 1 + i teilbaren Teilnenner, wenn, nach Forthebung gemeinsamer Faktoren, weder

 der Zàhler noch der Nenner der Zahl durch 1 + i teilbar sind" (Hurwitz 1895,27/28; Hurwitz 1902, 246).

 where /rm+i is a unit. If am ξ 1 mod 1 + i, then it follows by induction that the same

 congruence holds for all predecessors μη. However, if an s Omod 1 + i, then the

 same reasoning implies μ„ = Omod 1 + i.81

 As often happens, the complex viewpoint provides new insights about the real case.

 Julius Hurwitz's continued fraction applied to real numbers leads to partial quotients

 from 2Z, and indeed, these continued fraction expansions coincide with the continued

 fraction with even partial quotients which was studied first by Schweiger (1982).82

 Another result of Julius' is the analogue of his brother's theorem on characterizing

 all eventually periodic continued fractions as roots of irreducible quadratic equations

 having Gaussian integers as coefficients. Another analogy to Adolf Hurwitz's paper

 is what kind of partial quotients can occur. For instance, if a partial quotient equals
 an = 1 + i, then the next partial quotient an+\ is different from 2,1 - i, -2i. A

 similar problem was already considered by Adolf Hurwitz for his continued fractions

 to the nearest Gaussian integers. Julius' doctorate also contains results about those

 admissible sequences. Adolf Hurwitz stated in his Jahrbuch iiber die Forstschritte der

 Mathematik review (Hurwitz 1894a) that the partial quotients "a, a\,..., an,xn+\

 fulfill certain constraints. (...). It is then proved that the expansion of any complex

 quantity converges, that it is finite, resp. periodic, if the quantity is a rational complex

 number, resp. satisfies a quadratic equation with integer complex coefficients. There

 is a relation of the investigated continued fraction expansion with another in which

 the tiling of the complex plane in the above mentioned squares is replaced by domains

 bounded by circular arcs. For this second expansion analogous results are proved as

 81 A short algebraic proof goes as follows. The set of Gaussian integers is a disjoint union of the principal

 ideal (a) = ( 1 +i )X[i ] and 1+(a). Denoting the Julius Hurwitz-continued fraction of a complex number χ by

 χ = [αο, αϊ α„,...] the numerators pn and denominators qn of its convergents ^ = [αο,αι, ...,α„]
 satisfy the following recursion formulae:

 ι = a, po = ao, and p„ = anp„-\ + pn-2.

 q-1 = 0, q0 = a, and q„ = a„qn^i + qn-2

 The proof is analogous to the one for regular continued fractions, and only the initial values differ. To
 continue, we rewrite the recursion formulae in terms of 2 χ 2-matrices as

 (££:,')-(:;)(?9-(<0 l"N»'

 After reducing the convergents ^ with respect to common powers of β in the numerator and denominator,
 it follows from the recurrence formuale that

 (ft+tM.fOjY· mod a,
 \<in+l In) V 1 °/

 where the congruence is with respect to each entry. Hence, comparing the first columns on both sides, we

 have shown that each finite Julius Hurwitz-continued fraction is of the form predicted by the theorem. To

 show the converse, one may use Fermat's descent method.

 82 In Perron (1913,186, vol. I), 3rd ed., Perron writes "Eine andere Vorschrift fBr die Wahl der Teilnenner

 stammt von J. Hurwitz (...); sie bildet das Analogon zu den halbregelmdBigen Kettenbriichen mit geraden

 Teilnennem." Actually, Julius Hurwitz-continued fractions of real numbers are exactly continued fractions

 with even partial quotients.

 for the first."83 These continued fractions of the second kind are the singular continued

 fractions developed in Hurwitz (1889).

 Building on his continued fraction expansion to the nearest lattice point in ( 1+i )Z[i ]

 from his dissertation, in his Habilitation thesis, Julius Hurwitz developed a method

 for the reduction of quadratic forms with complex coefficients and variables; this was

 published as Hurwitz (1902) in the same renown journal Acta Mathematica as his

 younger brother's first paper (Hurwitz 1888). Julius had this very application in mind

 even during the preparation of his dissertation. In fact, Wangerin wrote in his report
 about Julius Hurwitz's dissertation that

 The author believes that the investigated continued fraction expansion may serve

 as basis for a theory of quadratic forms with complex variables and complex
 coefficients.84

 His approach is quite similar to the one for real quadratic forms with positive deter

 minants. He solved the problem of determining whether two given forms with equal

 determinants are equivalent, and of finding all substitutions which transform one form

 to any of its equivalent forms. Both questions were already solved by Dirichlet (1842)

 by a different method.

 5 Reception in the twentieth century

 Continued fractions are always linked with the name of Perron. Oskar Perron was

 born on May 7,1880 in Frankenthal (near Mannheim), and died in Munich February
 22, 1975. He studied in Munich and obtained his doctorate there in 1902; his dis

 sertation was about the rotation of a rigid body and was supervised by Lindemann

 (who was already responsible for Adolf Hurwitz's appointment in Kdnigsberg). In

 his post-doctoral research, however, Perron became interested in the work of Pring

 sheim, another professor at Munich with an expertise in complex analysis (and father

 of Katharina Pringsheim, later Katia Mann, the wife of Thomas Mann). At that time,

 Pringsheim (1900) was investigating the Stern-Stolz criterion (Stolz 1885) for con

 vergence of periodic complex continued fractions. Perron did his Habilitation in 1907

 on a related question, namely Jacobi's general continued fraction algorithm (Jacobi

 83 "Denkt man sich die durch 1 + i teilbaren ganzen complexen Zahlen a, a\ a„ und die complexe
 Grôsse x„+i willkiirlich gewâhlt, so wird der Kettenbruch an, x„+l) durch seine Einrichtung
 eine bestimmte complexe Grôsse χ ergeben. Dieser Kettenbruch braucht aber nicht notwendig mit der nach

 periodisch wird, wenn die Grôsse eine complexe rationale Zahl ist, resp. einer quadratischen Gleichung

 Zahlenebene in die oben genannten Quadrate eine solche in Gebiete tritt, die von Kreisstiicken begrenzt

 sind. Fiir diese zweite Entwickelung werden die analogen Sâtze wie fiir die erste bewiesen."

 84 "Der Verfasser glaubt, dass die von ihm genauer erforschte Art der Kettenbruchentwicklung als Grund

 lage fiir die Theorie der quadratischen Formen mit complexen Variablen und complexen Koeffizienten
 dienen kônne" (Archive of Halle University, Rep. 21 Nr. 162).

 1868); this topic led Perron and later Frobenius to the discovery of the famous Perron

 Frobenius theorem for matrices with non-negative entries.85

 The standard reference in the theory of continued fractions is Perron's monograph
 Perron (1913), but neither the first edition from 1913 nor the second edition from

 1929 mentions Adolf or Julius' Hurwitz's work on complex continued fractions. How
 ever, the third edition from 1954 contains a whole section on continued fractions in

 imaginary quadratic number fields (§46). Here, Perron gives a brief introduction to

 Adolf Hurwitz's (1888) work. A proof is given that this expansion is finite if, and

 only if, the number in question is a Gaussian rational. Some attention is also paid to

 approximation properties as well as to admissible sequences, and periodic complex

 continued fractions. It is a natural question to ask for what other fields than Q(i) one

 can obtain similar results. It seems that Dickson (1927) was the first to investigate
 in which quadratic fields Q(*/D) an analogue of the Euclidean algorithm is possi
 ble. He proved that for imaginary quadratic fields there exists a Euclidean algorithm
 if, and only if, D = — 1, -2, -3, -7, —11; however, his proof for real quadratic

 fields turned out to be false and was corrected by Perron (1932). With regard to this,

 Lunz (1937) considered in his dissertation (supervised by Perron) the field Q(V—2)·

 Already in this case, fundamental questions, such as the growth of the denominators

 of the convergents in absolute value, seem to be more difficult to answer than in the

 Gaussian number field. Further studies were made by Arwin (1926,1928) for several

 other imaginary quadratic fields. Gintner (1936) proved in her doctoral thesis at the

 University of Vienna in 1936 that in non-Euclidean imaginary quadratic number fields

 one can find examples where the corresponding continued fraction expansion does not

 converge, e.g.,

 ζ = \*J—d ifd φ 3 mod4, ζ = ^^V~d ifd = 3 mod4.

 Moreover, she studied diophantine approximation in imaginary quadratic fields not
 only with continued fractions but also using Minkowski's geometry of numbers. Fur
 ther results along these lines were found by her thesis advisor (Hofreiter 1938). Sum

 ming up, a continued fraction expansion to the nearest integer is possible if, and only

 if, the order of the imaginary quadratic field is Euclidean.

 In 1912, Mathews considered binary quadratic forms with complex coefficients; he

 stressed that his approach differs from Julius Hurwitz's method in his Habilitation the

 sis, published as Hurwitz (1902). Mathews avoided considering condensation points;

 his reasoning shows immediately that the number of reduced forms is finite. Moreover,

 "the roots of a reduced form are expressible as pure recurrent chain-fractions appears
 as a corollary, instead of being a definition".86 Ford (1918, 23) wrote in a footnote:

 "The continued fractions involving complex integers have been little studied. Only one

 of such fraction has, so far as I know, appeared in the literature. See [Adolf] Hurwitz,

 Acta Mathematica, vol. 11 (1887), pp. 187-220; Auric, Journal de mathématiques, 5th

 85 See Hawkins (2008) for a very informative study of this topic.

 86 See Mathews (1912,329). The old-fashioned, direct translation chain fraction from the German Ketten
 bruch is outdated. The English notion continued fraction has been used since around 1900 the first articles

 on this topic in English had been published.

 of Adolf Hurwitz's continued fractions. In 1927, Stein used in her dissertation Julius

 Hurwitz-continued fractions in order to compute units in quadratic extensions of num

 ber fields. This line of investigation was proposed by her supervisor Helmut Hasse.

 The divisibility of the denominators of the convergents by 1 -l-i is here an essential tool.

 The research monograph of Koksma (1936) mentions both the contributions of Adolf

 Hurwitz and the dissertation (Hurwitz 1895) of Julius. Dickson's (1923) encyclopedia

 on the history of number theory briefly quotes Julius' publication (Hurwitz 1902) and

 the many works of Adolf Hurwitz. Whereas we can find several references to the work

 of the Hurwitz brothers before the big changes the world had to face when the Nazis

 came to power in Germany and set half of the world on flame, there are nearly no
 citations after World War II. Brezinski (1991, 270) mentions Julius Hurwitz in a list

 of contributors to the theory of continued fractions but refers to Koksma (1936) for
 details.

 In the twentieth century, continued fractions were studied for many different rea

 sons. Whereas in the nineteenth century much attention was given to convergence

 criteria and diophantine approximation, new lines of investigation after World War

 II were the ergodic theory of continued fractions and the consideration of a contin

 ued fraction expansion as a product of linear fractional transformations. The latter

 approach is related to the modular group, while the former has roots in an old problem

 on the statistics of the partial quotients of the regular continued fraction expansion

 posed by Gauss.

 The first sentence of Ito and Tanaka (1981,153) illustrates the different approaches

 for research on continued fractions: "The simple continued-fraction expansion of

 real numbers is an important concept in the theory of numbers. And the continued

 fraction expansion defined by Hurwitz is also important because it is the expansion

 by the nearest integers. These two continued-fraction expansions give rise to many

 interesting problems not only in the theory of numbers but also in ergodic theory."

 Here, Adolf Hurwitz's continued fraction is meant. There is previous work by Kaneiwa

 et al. (1975, 1976) which already contains a certain similarity to Julius' continued

 fraction. If ρ denotes the cube root of unity in the upper half-plane, a bracket is

 defined by

 [z] := \u\p + [ujp for ζ = up + ν ρ

 with real u and v. Given a complex number z, iterations of the transform ζ τ — [£]
 yield a continued fraction in a similar way as in the previous section for Julius' expan

 sion. Their intention was similar: Admissible sequences are discussed and diophantine

 properties investigated, and a Lagrange-type theorem for general quadratic extensions
 is included in Kaneiwa et al. (1976). In a subsequent paper, Shiokawa (1976) intro

 duced tools from ergodic theory in order to show that Τ is ergodic which allows one
 to deduce several metrical results about this complex continued fraction expansion.

 In none of these papers is Julius' work is mentioned; it seemed that his insights had
 fallen into oblivion.

 Complex continued fractions 525

 In 1985, about one century after Julius' doctorate, Shigeru Tanaka published the

 identical continued fraction transformation a second time. He refers only to the work of

 Adolf Hurwitz, and it is rather unlikely that he was familiar with Julius' thesis, which

 was only published in German and is hardly accessible [if one does not know that a

 short version is contained as first part in Hurwitz ( 1902)] .87 Furthermore, his approach

 is very different. While Julius' point of view is quite geometrical, Tanaka's motiva

 tion was to investigate ergodic properties of the continued fraction. He succeeded in

 determining a natural extension of the transformation Τ and thereby constructing an

 invariant measure with respect to which the continued fraction map Τ is ergodic. With

 this property, Tanaka was, among other things, able to transfer results from Shiokawa's

 ergodic theoretical approach to Adolf Hurwitz's continued fraction to the theory of

 Julius' complex continued fraction. In that sense Tanaka's work built on Shiokawa's

 in a similar way to the way that Julius was continuing Adolf Hurwitz's approach.

 Recently, complex continued fractions have been studied in a rather different con

 text. Nearly nothing is known about the regular continued fraction expansion of real

 algebraic irrationals of degree strictly larger than two. For instance, it is an open ques

 tion whether the sequence of partial quotients of such a real algebraic irrational is

 bounded or not; the same problem is also unanswered for other real continued frac

 tions. It follows from Adolf Hurwitz's work that the situation for complex algebraic

 irrationals is quite different: Complex irrationals satisfying an irreducible quadratic

 equation with coefficients from Z[i] have a periodic, henceforth bounded sequence
 of partial quotients (extending Lagrange's celebrated theorem). However, Hensley

 (2006) discovered a far more surprising phenomenon: There exist complex algebraic

 irrationals having a bounded but not eventually periodic sequence of partial quotients

 in Adolf's continued fraction expansion; an example is ζ = -JÏ -1 + i (V5- 2) which

 is a solution of the irreducible biquadratic equation

 Z4 + (4 + 8i)Z3 - (12 - 24i)Z2 - (32 - 16i)Z + 24 = 0.

 Bosma and Gruenewald (2012) proved the existence of complex algebraic numbers

 of arbitrary even degree having a continued fraction expansion with bounded partial
 quotients (being non-periodic for degree larger than two over the Gaussian number
 field).

 What makes these approaches to implementing continued fraction algorithms for

 complex numbers interesting for current research in number theory is that there are

 many open questions concerning algebraic and ergodic features of complex contin

 ued fraction expansions. Another approach to diophantine approximation of complex

 numbers via continued fractions is due to Schmidt (1975, 1982); his papers include

 references to the work of Julius and Adolf Hurwitz. Schmidt's type of continued frac

 tion is superior if the quality of approximation is paramount, and it allows the use of

 tools from ergodic theory too, at the price that his continued fraction expansions lack

 the simplicity of the continued fraction expansions found by the Hurwitz brothers.

 Further approaches are due to Cassels, Ford, Gintner, LeVeque, Mahler, Nakada, and

 others; their discussion is beyond the scope of our article.
