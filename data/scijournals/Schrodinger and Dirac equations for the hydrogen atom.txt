 Schrödinger and Dirac equations for the hydrogen
 atom, and Laguerre polynomials

 Abstract It is usually claimed that the Laguerre polynomials were popularized by

 Schrödinger when creating wave mechanics; however, we show that he did not imme-

 diately identify them in studying the hydrogen atom. In the case of relativistic Dirac

 equations for an electron in a Coulomb field, Dirac gave only approximations, Gordon
 and Darwin gave exact solutions, and Pidduck first explicitly and elegantly intro-
 duced the Laguerre polynomials, an approach neglected by most modern treatises and

 articles. That Laguerre polynomials were not very popular before their use in quan-
 tum mechanics, probably because they had been little used in classical mathematical

 physics, is confirmed by the fact that, as we show, they had been rediscovered inde-

 pendently several times during the nineteenth century, in published or unpublished
 studies of Abel, Murphy, Chebyshev, and Laguerre.

 1 Introduction

 In 1923, Louis de Broglie published three short communications (de Broglie
 1923a,b,c), in which he proposed to associate a wave to any moving particle, thus

 extending the dual character of the photon. De Broglie's ingenious intuition was con-

 firmed 4 years later by the experiments of Clinton J. Davisson , Lester H. Germer, and
 George P. Thomson on diffraction waves of the electron, but an equation describing
 this mysterious wave and taking into account its dynamics was still missing from de
 Broglie's study. Erwin Schrödinger, at the time a professor in Zürich, was told by

 Einstein about de Broglie's articles in 1925 and solved this problem in January 1926
 (Schrödinger 1926a). His article built on his earlier presentation of his famous (sta-

 tionary) equation, which had taken in three pages, four equations, and two fruitful and

 ingenious Ansatz, and became an important article of 15 pages, in which Schrödinger
 also solved his equation in the case of the hydrogen atom, using Fuchs' theory of

 linear differential equations and the Laplace transform. He also recovered in this way

 the formulae for the energy levels given by Bohr in 1913. Both his way of introducing

 the wave equation, and his way of solving it for the hydrogen atom have disappeared
 from standard treatises and textbooks on quantum mechanics.

 One aim of this article is to clarify the claim of some mathematicians involved

 in the theory of special functions that the Laguerre polynomials were popularized
 by Schrödinger when creating wave mechanics. It is partly true, but the Austrian

 physicist did not immediately identify the polynomials occurring in the Hydrogenic

 wave functions with Laguerre polynomials. A part of this story is very well described
 and documented in the remarkable book of Mehra and Rechenberg (1987), and in
 Rechenberg (1988), but is not mentioned in the other famous history of quantum
 mechanics by Jammer (1966). In contrast, the fact is emphasized in Walter Moore's

 interesting biography of Schrödinger, (Moore 1989), who writes on p. 199:

 It is surprising that Schrödinger had so much difficulty in solving the radial
 equation. He was using as a reference the little book of Ludwig Schlesinger,
 Introduction to the Theory of Differential Equations , published in 1900. As the

 title indicates, it is not a book devoted to the practical problems of solving dif-

 ferential equations of mathematical physics. Schrödinger evidently was not yet

 using the book that became the vade mecum of theoretical physicists, Methoden
 der Mathematische Physik /, published in 1924 by Richard Courant and David

 Hilbert. On page 161 of this book, the equation satisfied by the Laguerre poly-
 nomials appears, and its form is very close to that of the radial equation for the
 H-atom, but the associated Laguerre polynomials, which actually provide the
 solutions for Schrödinger equation are not cited. The book of Frank and von

 Mises, Die Differential-und Integralgleichungen der Mechanik und Physik was
 published only at the end of 1925; this gave a complete account of the associ-
 ated Laguerre polynomials and their corresponding differential equations, but it
 would have been just too late to help Schrödinger.

 We discuss those questions in Sect. 2.

 If the Laguerre polynomials are now universally accepted and used in solving

 Schrödinger equation with a Coulomb potential, then the situation is quite different
 in the case of the Dirac equations of relativistic quantum mechanics. The second aim

 of this study is to survey the various approaches used to solve the Dirac equations for

 the relativistic electron, in which the explicit use of Laguerre polynomials is far less
 popular. In the preface of the second edition of his monumental treatise (Frank and

 von Mises 1925-1935) written in collaboration with Richard von Mises, Philipp Frank

 mentions that the first edition of volume 2 was in print when Schrödinger's first arti-
 cles on wave mechanics appeared. However, the second edition contains a new sixth

 part, more than one hundred pages long, entirely devoted to the new wave mechan-

 ics, including the relativistic wave equation of Paul Dirac. Laguerre polynomials are

 explicitly used in the solution of the problem of the electron in a Coulomb field for the

 Schrödinger equation, but not for the Dirac equations. In fact, Dirac (1928) did not
 solve his relativistic equations for the hydrogen atom exactly in his seminal article,
 but only discussed the first two approximations. A few months later, Walter Gordon

 and Charles G. Darwin independently solved the equations using power series, which

 Gordon recognized as confluent hypergeometric functions (related to Laguerre poly-
 nomials) (Gordon 1928; Darwin 1928). Those polynomials were explicitly introduced

 in the solution of the relativistic electron in a Coulomb field 1 year later by Pidduck

 (1929). We analyze these questions in Sect. 3.

 Laguerre polynomials were not very popular before their use in quantum mechan-

 ics, as is confirmed by their own story, which seems to require some amplifications and

 corrections. We show in the Appendix that, although usually named after Edmond-
 Nicolas Laguerre, those polynomials were rediscovered independently several times
 during the nineteenth century, in published or unpublished studies of several math-
 ematicians, such as Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Niels-Hendrik Abel, Robert Murphy in
 1835, Pafnuti L. Cheby shev in 1859, and Laguerre himself in 1879. We analyze the

 corresponding contributions and their contexts in the Appendix. For a long time,
 Laguerre polynomials remained much less popular than other special functions such

 as Bessel or hypergeometric functions, and Legendre or Hermite polynomials, proba-

 bly because they were less used in problems on classical mathematical physics of this
 time. This is confirmed by their late inclusion in classical treatises of analysis.

 2 The Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom

 2.1 Schrödinger equation

 Schrödinger's first article on quantization and eigenvalues proposed a fairly surpris-

 ing and nowadays almost forgotten method for obtaining the wave equation for the

 hydrogen atom (Schrödinger 1926a). This cited article and its genesis have been nicely
 analyzed (Bloch 1976; Gerber 1969; Kragh 1982; Kubli 1970; Wessels 1979), and we
 concentrate here on the essential aspects.

 The classical Hamiltonian for the Keplerian motion of an electron around a posi-

 2

 tively charged fixed nucleus, with Coulomb potential V(r) = - y, is given by

 'p' 2
 H(q, p) =*-?- 'p' 2m + V(r) = E,

 2m

 where E is the energy, q = (jc, y, z) the position of the electron, r = (x2 + y2 H- z2) 1/2

 its distance from the nucleus, p = (m ^ , m ^ , m its linear momentum, and e and

 m, respectively, its charge and mass. The corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation for
 the action S of the classical motion of the electron is the nonlinear first-order partial

 differential equation

 S = K'og}//

 The first Ansatz in Schrödinger (1926a) consists in introducing a new function x/r
 linked to S by the relation

 for some constant K. Kubli (1970) has noticed that such a transformation had already

 appeared in 191 1 in an article by Sommerfeld and Runge (the daughter of Carl Runge)
 (1911), who attributed the idea to the Dutch physicist Peter Debye. Kubli has sug-

 gested that Debye, then professor at the University of Zürich, could have passed this
 information on to Schrödinger, who quoted the article in later publications. Indeed,
 when approximating a wave equation

 Аф + п2к2ф = 0

 for к large, the transformation

 ^ = AexpO'fcS) (1)

 is used where A and S are considered as slowly varying functions to obtain, in first
 approximation, the eikonal equation

 |VS|2 = n2.

 Schrödinger's Ansatz appears as the inverse of the transformation (1). Instead of solv-
 ing the transformed equation

 Schrödinger introduced without any comment, in a bold second Ansatz , the integral
 over the whole space of its left-hand member (keeping the same notation ^ 0

 In a correction added at the end of the article, Schrödinger suggested imposing the
 normalization condition / / /кз Ý2 = 1» without discussing its relations with the
 boundary conditions at infinity. Although Schrödinger gave no explanation and no

 heuristics for his second Ansatz, one can think that, in his quest of an eigenvalue prob-

 lem that would give Bohr's energy levels as eigenvalues, he realized that the quadratic

 left-hand member of (2) used as the argument in the integral functional of a variational

 problem gives as its Euler-Lagrange equation a linear partial differential equation of
 the second order.

 2.2 The solution for the hydrogen atom

 Schrödinger passed from (jc, y, z ) to spherical coordinates (r, 9 , <p ), and obtained the

 radial equation for x (r)

 d2X , 2dx , (2mE , 2 me2 n(n + l)' A

 by taking Eq. 3, written in those coordinates, and setting ^(r, в , ц> ) = Ул,*(0, <p)x (r)>

 where Yn¿ is the spherical harmonic and 'k' <n;n,k are integers.

 In order to apply the Laplace transform with kernel ezr to (4) (Ince 1927), the
 centrifugal term in is eliminated through the change of unknown xi'*) = rnU(r ),
 which gives the following Laplace-type equation:

 d2U / SAdU i ei'„

 for U , where

 Then, Schrödinger took the solution as given in a textbook of 1900 by Schlesinger
 (1900), and used the same notation:

 U(r) = J ^(z-c.r-'^-czr-'dz,

 where the integral is taken along a path L such that the function

 Some delicate arguments based on the condition at infinity, and suitable manipulations

 of the signs of E , allowed him to deduce the existence of "discrete states," implying

 of his first article, Schrödinger thanked Hermann Weyl, then professor at the Univer-

 sity of Zürich, for having provided him with the necessary information for treating
 equation (4), and sent the reader to Schlesingers book mentioned above. Therefore,

 we see that Weyl himself, an outstanding mathematician, did not recognize Laguerre
 polynomials.

 below) was also sometimes used when a = m, was a positive integer. This distinction

 2.3 The occurrence of Laguerre polynomials

 In a footnote of his second (and longer) article, Schrödinger thanked Erwin Fues, at
 this time, his assistant in Zürich, for identifying the eigenfunctions of Planck's oscil-

 lator with Hermite polynomials, and observed that he has identified the polynomials

 obtained in his first article with the (2 n + 1 )th derivative of the ( n + /)th Laguerre
 polynomial (Schrödinger 1926b). Thus, Schrödinger definitely abandoned Schlesing-
 ers approach and, following a suggestion of Weyl and Fues, referred to the recent

 Methoden der mathematischen Physik of Richard Courant and David Hilbert pub-
 lished in 1924, with the aim of providing the mathematical foundations of classical
 physics (Courant and Hilbert 1924). In the French translation of Schrödinger (1927)
 published in 1933, Schrödinger advised the reader to forget about his first approach,
 and suggested it would be rather better to consult recent books on wave mechanics,

 instead of his articles, for a clearer and simpler approach.

 The explicit definition of the Laguerre polynomials of degree n (up to a multipli-

 cative constant An) is

 n / ' m 1

 is now abandoned, and the expression Laguerre polynomial is used for Ln for any
 value of a.

 The choice An = 1 comes from the generating function

 with a = -n and c = a + l (Kummer 1836). The solution of (15) analytic at x = 0

 For more details, see, for example, the classical treatises in the area (Buchholz
 1969; Henrici 1974-1986; Lavrentiev and Shabat 1977; Lebedev 1965; Nikiforov
 and Ouvarov 1976; Rainville 1960; Slater 1960).

 With the notation of (13), the function f(x) in formula (6) is written, up to

 a multiplicative constant, as the Laguerre function xner^x^L^¡l(x) instead of

 j twe_(*/2)L^_ij(jc). Let us also notice that in books on quantum physics, n and /
 are permuted and, therefore, the quantum number I becomes smaller than n. Follow-

 ing Schrödinger's theory, the probability that the electron is located at a distance r from
 the nuclei is controlled by L (Ar), where the constant к depends on the choice of

 units and the quantum number /. This probability vanishes, therefore, at the zeros of
 those Laguerre polynomials. For each /, the n - / - 1 zeros xlN . of (*), where
 N = n - I - 1, generate the "universal" sequences of "excited nodes":

 In his third article, where he introduced his famous perturbation method, Schröding-

 er used parabolic coordinates to study Stark's effect, when a constant electric field is
 added to the Coulomb force (Schrödinger 1926c). In this case, the separation of vari-
 ables introduces two different Laguerre polynomials with different arguments. This
 article contains in a Mathematical appendix , a section called The orthogonal func-

 tions and the generalized Laguerre polynomials where Schrödinger summarizes, with
 reference to the treatise Courant-Hilbert mentioned above, the definition and main

 properties of Laguerre polynomials, and explicitly evaluates the two important inte-

 grals:

 using the generating function of Laguerre polynomials,

 In order to sum up, Schrödinger did not seem to be very familiar with special

 functions at the time he developed his wave mechanics, even if he checked that the
 polynomial part of f(x) was not that of Legendre's, and even though he had earlier

 solved the problem of the infinite vibrating string with the Bessel functions Jn . His
 reference book (Schlesinger 1900) contained a whole chapter on Gauss's differential
 equation for hypergeometric functions, but did not cover the confluent form that con-

 tains, as we have seen, Laguerre's differential equation as a special case. Like many

 other first class scientists, Schrödinger first solved his equation for the hydrogen atom

 using the mathematical tools he had learned at university, instead of searching more
 recent information. The same attitude also appears in the way that the equation in
 X(r) is solved in the famous Lectures on physics (Feynman et al. 1966) of Richard

 P. Feynman, where power series are used, thereby avoiding the explicit introduction of

 Laguerre polynomials, in this case for pedagogical reasons linked to the mathematical
 level of the students.

 3 Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom

 3.1 Dirac: a perturbation approach

 The history of Dirac's relativistic theory of electrons is nicely described in Kragh's

 studies (1 98 1 ; 1 990). Dirac's system of equations for an electron in an electromagnetic
 field with scalar potential Ao and vector potential A = (A' , A2, A3) is

 and ai , . . . o?4 are (4 X 4)-matrices satisfying the relations (Dirac 1928)

 aras -h asar = 2 6r,sl (r,s = 1,2, 3, 4).

 In the special case of a central field of force, where A' = A2 = A3 = 0 and
 Ao = § V(r), with solutions periodic in time (so that po is now a parameter equal to
 l /с times the energy level E ), Dirac showed, after lengthy considerations based on

 arguments drawn from noncommutative algebra instead of the classical separation of
 variables, that the radial part of the first and the third components an(i Ý3 of x/r
 must satisfy the system of first-order differential equations

 satisfy the same system.

 where В = (po -f V + тс)/ h. The acceptable values of the parameter po = j are
 those for which (20) has a solution that is finite at r = 0 and at r = 00. In order to

 compare this equation with those of previous theories, Dirac put 1Д3 = rx, so that x
 must be solution of

 TT d r¿ + ? r T ar + Л - (T)2 ' h J - *^1 r¿ *
 TT d r¿ r T ar ' Л / ' h J r¿

 By neglecting the last term, which is small because h В is large, one recovers the
 Schrödinger equation (4) for V(r) = c2/cr , with a relativistic correction included.

 Dirac then showed that the next approximation gave corrections - 2w^2r3 Ü + 1)

 and 2m j 9 coincided with the ones given by the earlier theory of Wolfgang
 Pauli and of Darwin, thus incorporating the spin in Schrödinger's theory (Pauli 1927;
 Darwin 1927).

 We see that Dirac did not solve his equation for the hydrogen atom exactly but
 restricted himself to the first two approximations. Why did such a mathematically

 gifted theoretical physicist refrain from solving Eq. 21 exactly for the Coulomb field?

 Kragh (1981, 1990) has suggested the following explanation:

 According to Dirac 's own account, he did not even attempt to solve the equa-

 tion (2 1 ) exactly, but looked for an approximation from the start. Dirac explains it

 [...]: 'I was afraid that maybe they [i.e., the higher order corrections] would not

 come out right.' [...] I shall propose a somewhat different version [...]. Having
 found equation (21) and having realized that it contained the correct spin, Dirac

 was in a hurry to publish and was not prepared to waste time in a detailed exam-
 ination of the exact energy levels of the hydrogen atom. He realized that it was

 not a mathematically simple problem and decided to publish the first approxi-
 mation. [...] Dirac knew that other physicists were also on the trail, so he may
 indeed have been motivated by [...] fear of not being first to publish, not any

 fear that the theory have serious shortcomings. This conjecture is substantiated

 by the fact that he did not attempt to obtain the exact agreement, not even after

 he had published his theory.

 3.2 Gordon: using confluent hypergeometric functions

 It did not take long for other physicists to obtain the complete solution. The first was

 Gordon, and the story is pleasantly told on p. 63 of Kragh's monograph (Kragh 1990):

 Within two weeks following submission of the article, Walter Gordon in Ham-
 burg was able to report to Dirac that he had derived the exact fine structure

 formula from the new equation and that Heisenberg^ first question [getting the
 Sommerfeld formulas in all approximations] could thus be answered affirma-

 tively. Reporting the main steps in the calculation, Gordon wrote : 'I should like

 very much to learn if you knew these results already and if not, if you think I
 should publish them.'

 Dirac's answer must have been positive, and, in an article received on February 23th

 where jFi is the confluent hypergeometric function defined in (16); (Gordon wrote
 F instead of the more recent notation i Fi). He noticed that the о j are of the same

 type as Schrödinger's eigenfunctions for the hydrogen atom, which can be written as
 X (r) = t~k°rrl i F' (-n, 21 + 2, 2kor). Excluding the case where ß = 0 or a negative
 integer, Gordon observed that i F' (a, ß , r) was a polynomial in r of degree - a when
 a is a negative integer, so that, for и = 1,2,3,..., one obtains a solution. When a and
 ß are real numbers that are not non-positive integers, Gordon showed that the corre-

 sponding solutions grow exponentially, and cannot satisfy the normalization condition.
 This is also in the case when n - 0 and j > 0, although an acceptable solution exists

 when n - 0 and j < - 1. Taking into account the relation (17) between the Laguerre

 polynomials and confluent geometric functions, one can say that Gordon implicitly
 solved the hydrogen problem for Dirac equations with Laguerre polynomials.

 3.3 Darwin: using power series

 The same problem was treated independently the same year in an article by Darwin,
 received March 6th 1928 (2 weeks later than Gordon!) (Darwin 1928). As mentioned

 by Kragh (1990), Darwin went to Cambridge a few days before Christmas 1927, and
 wrote a letter to Niels Bohr about his surprise at learning of Dirac's new electron

 theory:

 I was at Cambridge a few days ago and saw Dirac. He has now got a completely
 new system of equations for the electron which does the spin right in all cases

 and seems to be 'the thing.' His equations are first order, not second, differential

 equations ! He told me something about them but I have not yet even succeeded

 in verifying that they are right for the hydrogen atom.

 In contrast to Gordon, whose article is purely technical, Darwin started with some
 comments about Dirac's abstract approach to relativistic quantum mechanics:

 There are probably readers who will share the present writer's feeling that the
 methods of non-commutative algebra are harder to follow, and certainly much

 more difficult to invent, than are operations of types long familiar to analysis.

 Wherever it is possible to do so, it is surely better to present the theory in a math-

 ematical form that dates from the time of Laplace and Legendre, if only because

 the details of the calculus have been so much more thoroughly explored. There-

 fore, the object of this study is to take Dirac's system and treat it by ordinary
 methods of wave calculus.

 The same opinion was also expressed in a letter of Darwin to Niels Bohr quoted by
 Kragh (1990):

 I continue to find that though Dirac evidently knows all about everything the

 only way to get it out of his writings is to think of it all for oneself in one's own

 way and afterwards to see it was the same thing.

 In order to find the energy levels in the radial field of force, Darwin set po =

 ^[E + eV(r)], omitted the vector potentials, wrote the corresponding Dirac equa-
 tions as an explicit system of four equations in four stationary wave functions ýj

 and, this time using the classical method of separation of variables, expressed the four

 functions as spherical harmonics multiplied by radial functions. He showed that ^1 , Ф2
 must involve the same radial function F(r), and ^3, ^4 the same radial function G(r).

 The corresponding solution was named ( F ь G¿)- Another way of elimination gave

 Observing that (29) is the same as (28) after the substitution к -+ -к - 1 , Darwin
 denoted the solution of (29) by (F_ , G_¿_i ).

 In order to discuss system (28) in the case of the Coulomb potential V (r) = f ,

 Darwin introduced the positive numbers A and В defined by

 and the fine structure constant у := Then, system (28) becomes

 444 J. Mawhin, A. Ronveaux

 and Darwin tried to solve this system in series of the form:

 F(r) = e~Xr (a0rß + airß~l + a2rß~2 + ■ ■ ■ )

 G(r) = e-Xr ( b0rß + birß~l + b2rß~2 + •■•).

 This gave him

 with the с s such that, with k! - y/(k + l)2 - y2 supposed positive,

 2 AB(s + l)c,+i = -cs(ß + 1 - 5 - k')(ß + 1-5 + ť),

 and so

 2^.5!(ЛВ)5

 In order that those solutions remain finite throughout space, the series must terminate

 for some value of s such that ß - s > 0. It is, therefore, necessary that ß = к! + n' - 1
 for some integer nf > 0, which determines the energy levels

 E = mc2[l + WT^' "2- <31)

 Observing that the positivity of к was nowhere used in the process above, Darwin

 concluded that the same solution holds for (29) with Coulomb potential provided that
 к is replaced by -к - 1 .

 Formula (31) was the same as the one already obtained by Sommerfeld in the frame

 of the old relativistic theory of quanta. As pertinently observed by Kragh (1990, p. 63),

 The fact that Dirac equations yielded exactly the same formula for the hydrogen

 atom that Sommerfeld had found 13 years earlier was another great triumph.
 It also raised the puzzling question of how Sommerfeld's theory, based on the

 old Bohr's theory and without any notion of spin, could give exactly the same

 energy levels as Dirac's theory. However, this was a historical curiosity that did
 not bother the physicists.

 In contrast to Gordon, Darwin did not relate his solutions to any special functions.

 Schrödinger and Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom, and Laguerre polynomials 445

 3.4 Pidduck: using Laguerre polynomials

 Less than lyear after Gordon and Darwin, Pidduck, in the article, (Pidduck 1929)
 received November 6th, 1928, solved the Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom using

 Laguerre polynomials explicitly and elegantly. Let us first write a few words on this
 scientist, who is somewhat less known than the other ones mentioned already. Freder-

 ick Bernard Pidduck was born on July 17th, 1885, in Southport, England. After high
 school in Manchester Grammar School, he proceeded to Exeter College, Oxford, in
 1903. He took a First Class degree in Maths Moderations in 1904, was awarded a
 Johnson University Scholarship in 1907, took a First Class degree in physics in 1907,
 his MA in 1910 and Dr. Sci. in 1923. His thesis included two important contributions
 to the kinetic theory of gases. Between 1907 and 1921, he was a Fellow at Queen's

 College, Oxford, and was then a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford from 1921
 until his retirement in 1950. He served twice as Vice-President of the College (1924-

 1926; 1931-1932), and was University of Oxford Pro-Proctor (1923-1924). During
 the First World War, he was a Ballistic Research Officer at the Woolwich Arsenal

 (1916-1919), where his study gained official commendation. It seems that Pidduck

 entered a little later into the life of his Colleges and University and was apt to dwell on

 grievances (Anonymous obituary 1952). His lack of social contacts may have contrib-

 uted to his somewhat justified feeling that he lacked public recognition for his notable
 achievements. After retirement, he lived at Keswick. An all-the-year round swimmer

 and amateur photographer, Pidduck died June 1 8th, 1 952 and his body was found on
 July 1st on a Lakeland mountainside (Anonymous obituary 1952).

 More than a theoretical physicist, Pidduck was an applied mathematician in the

 pure British tradition, and contributed mostly to the mathematical theory of electric-
 ity, with special attention to diffraction of waves and the magnetron oscillator. He
 published a Treatise on Electricity in 1916 that was translated into Spanish in 1921
 and re-edited in 1925, his Lectures on Mathematical Theory of Electricity in 1937, and

 his Currents in aerials and high-frequency networks in 1946. He was an enthusiast for

 the M.K.S. system of electrical units, co-authoring with R. K. Sas a pamphlet on The
 Metre-kilo gram- second System of Electrical Units in 1947. All this study, of course,
 made Pidduck familiar with the use of orthogonal polynomials and special functions,
 and indeed in 1910, he introduced a class of polynomials that he denoted (n,À), and

 which were generated by the function (Pidduck 1910), in a contribution to

 fluid mechanics, The polynomials (и, k) are now sometimes referred as Pidduck poly-
 nomials (Bacry and Boon 1985), and are related to others such as the Mittag-Leffler,
 Hardy, and Pollaczek polynomials (Pollaczek 1956).

 Let us now come to Pidduck's contribution to the solution of Dirac equations for

 the electron. He started his article as follows:

 The radial functions in Dirac's theory of the electron were found by Gordon for

 the field of a single nucleus and shown to be degenerate hypergeometric func-

 tions of the type used by Schrödinger. Gordon's results are obtained here by a

 slightly different method, in which the two functions are made to depend on a
 single function satisfying Laguerre's differential equation.

 Strangely, Pidduck did not quote Darwin's article of 1928, but, when writing the
 equations for the radial functions supposedly taken from Gordon's article of 1928, he

 in fact started from Darwin's system (30) (with F replaced by - F), not from Gordon's

 system (23). He defined j to be k + 1 when it is positive, and -k when it is negative
 (the value zero being excluded), to obtain

 i£ d + i±lf_|L('_ft„+mc2_£!)c = o, (33)
 d r r ne ' r )

 and stated: "write, with a small modification of Darwin's notation" (our emphasis),

 He then changed the independent variable by letting x = ~ to obtain the system

 Pidduck's ingenious idea consisted then in looking for F and G in the form

 F(x) = e~KxxJ~l ( Px^-(x) + Qz(x) '

 (d /?* - (*) + Sz(jc) V J , (3o) ш

 which involve the single function z, where K, Jy P, Q, R, S are undetermined con-

 stants. The identification of the two second-order differential equations generated by
 introducing (36) into (35) allowed him to compute those constants, namely

 Now, the first equation reduces to

 and so z = Lp, to insure that F and G vanish at infinity.

 Schrödinger and Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom, and Laguerre polynomials 447

 An explicit use of the structure relation (10) for Laguerre polynomials allowed
 Pidduck to write the solutions F and G as a linear combination of two Laguerre
 polynomials

 F{x) = [(n + j)L?(x) + (N + y)Lj_,(jc)] (37)

 CW = e~ [(и + j)Lpq{x) ~(N + J)Lqp_t(x)] . (38)

 Pidduck concluded by observing that

 one can now calculate the integrals required in the theory of perturbations with

 the same facility as in Schrödinger's theory, since the methods of Schrödinger
 (1926c) do not require q to be an integer.

 In order to compare Pidduck's results with Gordon's, we notice that, Gordon's a is
 Pidduck's y (Sommerfeld's fine structure constant), and writing E = hv in (34) we
 obtain

 and

 , = __Ä_-ü2-y2)1'2. ч = 1 U2 -У2)"2-

 mc2y/' - (E/mc2)2

 Hence, (25) shows that p is equal to Gordon's n , and (24) shows that q is equal to two

 times Gordon's p. Consequently, relation (17) implies that Gordon's solution (26) and
 Pidduck's solution (37) indeed does imply the same Laguerre polynomials.

 3.5 Further literature

 In contrast to the case of the Schrödinger equation, Laguerre polynomials do not seem

 to have been adopted by classical textbooks on relativistic quantum mechanics when

 solving the Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom. In his epoch-making monograph
 of 1930, Dirac included a solution of his equation for the hydrogen atom and only

 quoted Gordon's article of 1928 (Dirac 1930). However, Dirac's approach is closer to
 Darwin's, as he solved the radial equation through a series, without any mention of

 confluent hypergeometric functions or Laguerre polynomials. Darwin's approach was

 chosen by Louis de Broglie to explain the fine structure of hydrogen atom in his mono-

 graph (de Broglie 1934), which describes Dirac's theory and gives a very clear and
 detailed exposition of Darwin's contribution. Weyl's monograph and the well-known
 survey articles of E. L. Hill-R. Landshoff and of Hans A. Bethe and Edwin E. Salpeter
 (born in 1924) in the Handbuch der Physik , all follow Gordon in representing the two
 functions as a linear combination of confluent hypergeometric functions j F' (a, b ; x)

 with polynomial coefficients, although Hill-Landshoff also describe Darwin's article

 448 J. Mawhin, A. Ronveaux

 (Weyl 1928; Hill and Landshoff 1938; Bethe and Salpeter 1957). The volume 4 of
 the monumental treatise of Landau and Lifchitz (1972) only quotes Gordon and Dar-

 win, and gives Gordon's solution in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions,
 although the well-known monograph of Schiff (1968) follows essentially Darwin's
 approach.

 A clear and detailed treatment of Dirac equations for the Coulomb field is given in
 the book of Nikiforov and Uvarov (1988). Starting from Dirac equations in the form

 given in Bethe and Salpeter (1957), they look for solutions of the form:

 (Jj) = та Лт(е,ф)

 where j is a quantum number specifying the total angular momentum of the particle
 (j = 1/2, 3/2, ...);/ and V are orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, which,

 for given j, can have the values j - ' and j + with V = 2j - /; the quantum
 number m takes half-integral values between the numbers - j and j. The functions

 Sljim and Slji'm , called spherical spinors, are connected to spherical harmonics Yim.
 Substitution gives a system of first-order linear equations in / and g whose solution
 must be such that rf(r) and rg(r ) are bounded near 0 and

 +00

 J r2[f2(r) + g2(r)]dr = 1.
 0

 A careful and detailed elimination procedure leads to the solution of a differential
 equation of the form

 xy" + (2v - X )/ + ny = 0

 whose only polynomial solutions are the Laguerre polynomials BnL2„~x . This makes
 it possible to express / and g in terms of products of xv~lt~x /2 with suitable lin-
 ear combinations of xL^[l(x) and L2v~~l(x). Notice that no reference is made to
 Gordon or Pidduck, and that Nikiforov-Uvarov's treatment is less elegant and more
 complicated than Pidduck's.

 Pidduck's contribution was also overlooked by Leverett Davis Jr, who started his

 article (Davis 1939) as follows :

 It does not appear to have been noticed that the radial functions that arise in the

 treatment of Dirac's relativistic hydrogenic atom can be expressed in terms of
 generalized Laguerre polynomials.

 He wrongly believed that he was the first to express the radial functions in terms of
 Laguerre polynomials L" for values of a and n related to the quantum numbers. He
 quoted neither Gordon nor Darwin. That the situation has not improved since is tes-

 tified by the recent article (Au vil and Brown 1978), where the Dirac equation for the

 Schrödinger and Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom, and Laguerre polynomials 449

 hydrogen atom is solved in terms of Laguerre polynomials, using a procedure used by
 Schiff (1968) for Klein-Gordon equation. The authors pertinently observe that

 A number of well-known quantum-mechanics texts derive the energy spectrum,

 but do not derive, or even quote, the eigenfunctions.

 In a more recent article devoted to the role of orthogonal polynomials in the hydrogen
 atom, Dehesa et al. (1991) noticed that

 For the Dirac equation, [...] the corresponding radial wave functions do not
 involve any longer a single Laguerre polynomial but a combination of two
 Laguerre polynomials [see also (Auvil and Brown 1978)], which receive the
 name of Dirac polynomials.

 If we remember that Dirac did not find a rigorous solution of his equation (21), then the

 name Pidduck polynomials should be historically more appropriate! Laguerre poly-
 nomials are also absent in the quoted articles on the history of Dirac equations, and in

 Dirac's authoritative scientific biography (Kragh 1990).

 Let us end with a very recent development related to Dirac equations and La-

 guerre polynomials, due to Antonio J. Durán and F. Alberto Grünbaum. In 1949, Mark

 G. Krein developed a theory of matrix- valued orthogonal polynomials without any ref-

 erence to differential equations (Krein 1 949). In 2004, Durán and Grünbaum developed

 a method for producing matrix- valued polynomials associated to second-order differ-

 ential operators with matrix coefficients (Durán and Grünbaum 2004). Observing that
 the Schrödinger equation is solved in several special problems through the use of

 orthogonal polynomials, and that Dirac equations can be seen as a first-order differen-

 tial equation with matrix coefficients acting on a four-component vector function, they
 established a connection between the solution of Dirac equations for a central Coulomb

 potential and the theory of matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials initiated by Krein
 (Durán and Grünbaum 2006). They quoted Darwin's article, but neither Gordon's nor
 Pidduck's ones, despite the fact that both Laguerre polynomials and hypergeomet-
 ric confluent functions are mentioned there, and absent in Darwin's treatment. They

 grounded their discussion on the solutions of Dirac equations given in recent treatises
 (Rose 1961; Nikiforov and Ouvarov 1976).

 The systematic lack of reference to Pidduck's article has a possible explanation.
 After 1926, most of the fundamental articles in quantum mechanics were published

 in the journals Zeitschrift für Physik or Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.
 Pidduck's article appeared in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society , which
 was not very popular among contemporary physicists, and was completely forgot-
 ten until the publication in 1940 of Hille-Shohat-Walsh's important bibliography on
 orthogonal polynomials (Hille et al. 1940).

 4 Conclusion

 In spite of their multiple paternity (see the Appendix), Laguerre polynomials have
 taken more time to penetrate the classical treatises of analysis of the end of the nine-

 teenth and the beginning of the twentieth century than other special functions such

 as Legendre polynomials, Bessel functions, hypergeometric functions, Chebyshev, or
 Hermite polynomials. For example, there is no trace of Laguerre polynomials in the

 monumental treatises of analysis of the French mathematicians Laurent (1885-1991),
 Jordan ( 1 887), Picard ( 1 89 1-1 897), Goursat ( 1 9 1 0-1 9 1 5), or Hadamard ( 1 927-1 930).

 The same is true for the classical Modern Analysis of the British mathematicians

 Whittaker and Watson (1902), concentrating on special functions, and the compre-
 hensive book Die partiellen Differential-Gleichungen der Mathematischen Physik of
 the German mathematician Weber (1900-1901) devoted to mathematical physics.
 This may be the reason why Laguerre polynomials were not immediately iden-

 tified by Schrödinger when solving his equation for the hydrogen atom. However,

 besides their presence in the solution of this important physical problem, the role of
 Hermite's polynomials in solving the linear oscillator in wave mechanics showed that

 further developments and computational successes of Schrödinger's quantum mechan-

 ics strongly depended on the appropriate tools developed by mathematicians involved
 in special functions and spectral theory, as surveyed in volume 1 of the Methoden

 der mathematischen Physik of Courant and Hilbert (1924). In return, those physi-
 cal applications popularized mathematical concepts that had remained rather little
 known. It is the case of Laguerre polynomials, where this is examplified, for exam-
 ple, by their systematic inclusion in subsequent treatises on analysis, such as those
 of Valiron (1942-1945), Favard (1960-1963), Smirnov (1969-1984), Lavrentiev and

 Shabat (1977), or Chatterji (1997-1998), and in most recent study on special functions
 (Erdélyi et al. 1953; Nikiforov and Ouvarov 1976). One can also consult the historical

 and technical articles contained in a conference devoted to orthogonal polynomials
 (Brezinski et al. 1985).

 The fruitful interplay between mathematics and physics always is a two-winners

 game.

 Appendix: Laguerre polynomials: a historical survey

 Introduction

 At the end of nineteenth century, the polynomials (7) with a = 0 were called poly-
 nomials of E. N. Laguerre , an expression switching to Laguerre polynomials at the

 beginning of the twentieth century. Richard Askey, in his comments on Szëgo's article
 (Szegö 1968), given in the Collected Papers of Szegö, observed (Askey 1982):

 There is no adequate historical treatment of orthogonal polynomials which is
 a shame for many reasons. First, a number of important parts of mathematics

 are directly related to orthogonal polynomials. Many of the methods developed
 to study orthogonal polynomials have been used in other parts of mathematics.

 Schrödinger and Dirac equations for the hydrogen atom, and Laguerre polynomials 45 1

 Finally, a source exists which makes it easy to find most of the important early
 article. This is (Hille et al. 1940). I think it is the best bibliography that has

 been compiled on any large part of mathematics. I have not found it very useful
 for research study but for historical study it is invaluable. [...] The classical
 orthogonal polynomials are mostly attributed to someone other than the person

 who introduced them. Szegö refers to Abel and Lagrange and Tschebyscheff in

 Szegö 1959, Chapter 5, for study on the Laguerre polynomials LPn(x). Abel's
 study was published posthumously in 1881. Probably the first published study
 on these polynomials that uses their orthogonality was by Murphy (Murphy
 1833-1835).

 The same names are quoted by Gautschi (1981). In the special case of Laguerre poly-

 nomials, we shall try to amplify and complete this historical sketch.

 Lagrange

 In a section of his memoir Solution de différents problèmes de calcul intégral of 1762

 entitled Recherche des cas ď intégration de V équation +ayt2m = T (with 2 m
 erronously replaced by m), Lagrange (1762) first considered the equation

 d2z о
 -4 + azt2m о = 0, (39)

 d t2

 and substituted the independent variable и = to reduce (39) to

 d 2z n dz
 3^ + ^ + ог = 0'

 where n = Introducing the new unknown given by z = xQku, with k2 + a = 0,
 Lagrange obtained the differential equation

 d2x / n' dx nk
 -j + ( 2 к -i - ) - - I
 d и1 V и/ du и

 and searched for a solution in the form:

 d2x / ч d X n

 through the change of variable и = - . Polynomial solutions of degree n = - |

 can effectively be written as Laguerre polynomials (0» but with a parameter

 X = Aur + Bur+l + Cur+2 + ... .

 In modern terminology, Eq. 40 is a confluent hypergeometric equation (15), which
 can be written in the more standard form:

 452 J. Mawhin, A. Ronveaux

 a = n - 1 depending upon ni Kummer polynomials would probably be more appro-
 priate (see Humbert 1922). It seems, therefore, more accurate to say that Lagrange
 reduced the integration of Eq. 39 to a Kummer equation, and gave a polynomial
 solution of it. The link with Laguerre polynomials is not very strong. Notice that in
 Lagrange's transformation for passing from (39) to (40), the chosen constants

 and k2 = -a could be arbitrary without changing the Kummer-type character of the
 equation for x(u).

 Now, as can be seen on p. 284 of volume II of his complete studies, (Sylow and Lie
 1881) an unpublished manuscript of Abel written in 1826 and entitled Mémoires de

 mathématiques par N. H. Abel contains, on pp. 75-79 a sequence of computations
 entitled Sur une espèce particulière de fonctions entières nées du développement de

 Thus, Abel's (pm is identical to the Lm given in (7) with a = 0, and is obtained through

 the generating function (8) with a = 0. Furthermore, multiplying each member of the
 identity

 with

 Murphy

 The contribution of Robert Murphy is quite remarkable. In the second of the three
 memoirs quoted in Murphy (1833-1835, p. 146), he introduced a family of poly-
 nomials Tn(z), of degree n , with z = lnř (written as h.l.t for hyperbolic logarithm
 of t):

 and computed the integrals

 showing in that way, from (42), the orthogonality of the families Tn(lnt) on ]0, 1[ .
 With Ln(x) = Tn(- In t), t = e*, Laguerre's orthogonality formula (14) (fora = 0)
 is recovered. Murphy's trick in proving the combinatorial identity came from the
 expansion of the product, in powers of h, of

 (1 ,+;) ' -(w + l) •
 (1 ,+;) ' -(w + l)

 for which the constant term, equal to zero for n > m coincides with the left-hand side

 of the identity. Murphy also obtained a Rodrigues-type representation formula (14)

 and a generating function for the family Tn( In t). The technique used here was based

 on Lagrange's inversion theorem, exactly in the same way as in the article of James
 Ivory and Carl Gustav Jacobi, published 2 years later (Ivory and Jacobi 1837), and

 dealing with the generating function and Rodrigues-type representation formula for
 Legendre polynomials (see Ronveaux and Mawhin 2005).

 Chebychev

 Chebyshev's fundamental article on orthogonal polynomials (Chebyshev 1859) is a

 continuation of a previous article on approximation (Chebychev 1858). There, given
 n + 1 values F(*o), F(x' ), . . . , F(xn) of a function F(x) defined on an interval /, and

 a probability law 0(x), Chebyshev searched for a polynomial approximation P(jc) of
 degree m < n minimizing the expression

 He showed that if f(x) := П"=о(* ~x¡), and if the expression was expanded

 in a continued fraction, its jth member ф j was a polynomial of degree j such that

 In his article of 1859, Chebyshev extended his approach to different cases where

 the sums above are replaced by integrals, and showed that the corresponding sequence
 of polynomials could be used to obtain developments of functions in series of those

 polynomials 'analogous to Fourier series'. In particular, when / = [0, oo) and 0(x) =
 ke~kx. Chebychev's method provided the development

 Hence, referring to formula (14) with« = 0, we see that, fork = 1, ýn(x) = n'Ln{x).
 Some recent studies give a nice description of Cheby shev 's contributions (Akhieser

 1998; Steffens 2006). The priority of Chebyshev over Hermite (for Hermite's polyno-

 mials) and over Laguerre (for Laguerre's polynomials) was also noticed by Dieudonné
 (1985). In the Russian mathematical literature, Laguerre polynomials are frequently
 called Chebychev-Laguerre polynomials (Lavrentiev and Shabat 1977).

 4.1 Laguerre

 It remained for Laguerre to be the first to give the main properties of Lm in the same

 article: orthogonality, the three-term recurrence relations, the differential equation, the

 generating function, and the inversion formula

 xn =п'^(-')к(ПЛьк(х),

 к= 0 ^ '

 which is nothing but Abel's unpublished formula (41) (Laguerre 1879a). Laguerre
 obtained his polynomials as denominators of the convergents of a development in
 continued fractions of the function f(x) = cx dt. He did not quote any of the
 authors we have just mentioned.

 However, in another article, Laguerre gave a general second-order differential equa-

 tion satisfied by a larger class of orthogonal polynomials {Рл(д:)} (Laguerre 1885),
 called today semi-classical orthogonal polynomials (Hendriksen and van Rossum
 1985). This equation, rediscovered by Oskar Perron in the context of Padé ap-
 proximants, is now sometimes called Laguerre-Perron's equation (Perron 1929).
 Using Laguerre's notation, this equation for the semi-classical orthogonal polynomial
 y = Pn is

 where v(jc) and w(x) are polynomials occurring in a first-order linear inhomogeneous

 differential equation for the Stieltjes function / linked to the orthogonality weight p

 by the relation

 J X - z

 The polynomials 0n and кп, with degree independent of n, are in general difficult to
 compute from v and w. Laguerre developed the case where w(x) = x and 2v(x) =
 a - X in detail, finding 0n(x) - 1 and кп( x) = n, discovering in the cited article the

 generalized Laguerre polynomials L„(j t), and giving their explicit representations.
 Hence, it is incorrect to write, as in Lebedev (1965, p. 76), that Laguerre only studied
 the case where a = 0.

 This important article, which was published 1 year before Laguerre's death, was

 omitted by Eugène Rouché from the list of Laguerre's scientific articles that concluded

 Laguerre' s obituary (Rouché 1886) and was forgotten by the editors when compiling
 Volume I of Laguerre's Oeuvres (Hermite et al. 1898-1905) devoted to algebra and the
 integral calculus. It was, however, added at the end of Volume II, which is otherwise

 devoted to geometry. This omission can possibly be explained by the existence of two
 earlier short publications of Laguerre (1879b, 1884) that have (almost) the same title

 and are reproduced in Volume I of the Oeuvres. They were published, respectively,
 in the Bulletin de la Société mathématique de France , and the Comptes Rendus des

 séances de l'Académie des Sciences , and were both related to the longer important
 article of Volume II of the Oeuvres. There is some confusion about the three titles,
 in the articles and in the table of contents of the Oeuvres : "fonction" and "fraction"

 appear randomly in "Sur la réduction en fractions continues d'une fraction (or fonc-

 tion).. . ." In fact "fraction" is probably a misprint, "fonction" being more appropriate.
 Furthermore, the 1884 note is wrongly dated from 1879 on p. 445 of the Oeuvres ,
 and refers to the longer article of 1885. The version of this 1885 article given in
 the Oeuvres , vol. II, corrects the incorrect numbering of the sections and formulas

 in the original article, but omits its last sentence, where Laguerre promises to come

 back to the integration of some systems of difference equations, already considered,
 in special cases, by Jacobi and Carl Wilhelm Borchardt, using elliptic and abelian
 functions:

 Je reviendrai du reste sur ce point particulier, en essayant de compléter à certains
 égards les résultats obtenus par ces illustres géomètres.

 Observe that, in his observation on Laguerre, Michael Bernkopf insists on the
 fact that this edition of the Oeuvres "teems with errors and misprints," but also
 misses introduction of the general family L„ in Laguerre (1879b) (Bernkopf
 1991).

 Sokhotskii and Sonine

 The same extension of Ln was given in 1873 by Yulian V. Sokhotskii in his thesis
 (Sokhotskii 1873), and, 7 years later, in a long article of Sonine (1880) on cylindrical

 Bessel functions. There, in Section 40, the polynomials T£ of degree n, still sometimes

 referred as Sonine polynomials , are defined via the generating functions

 / л e~r Jm(2i*/rx) n

 Ыг'*)= / л =¿0Tm(x)r' n

 where Jm is the Bessel function of first kind, and m is an integer. From the differential

 equation obtained by Sonine, it is easy to identify T£ (x) (up to a constant factor) with

 the polynomials 'F'(-nym + 1; jc) or L«m)(j t). As Sonine's article was submitted
 in August 1879 and Laguerre's article (1879a) was published the same year, it is not

 surprising that Sonine did not quote Laguerre.

 Fejér

 In an article of 1909, announced in a short note at the Comptes Rendus , Leopold

 Fejér, without any mention of Laguerre or any of the other authors above, obtained

 the asymptotic development of the function:

 In a note to those articles, Turán observed that being the generating function
