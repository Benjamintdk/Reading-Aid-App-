 Abstract The theory of exterior differential systems plays a crucial role in Cartan's

 whole mathematical production. As he once recognized, all the germs of his subsequent

 work were contained there. Indeed, it provided him with powerful technical tools that

 turned out to be very useful in many different fields such as the theory of partial dif-

 ferential equations, the theory of infinite dimensional Lie groups (Lie pseudogroups)

 and differential geometry. Nevertheless, scarce attention has been paid to this area of

 historical research thus far. Although authoritative scholars have investigated the foun-

 dation of exterior differential calculus in Cartan's early papers, no specific analysis of

 Cartan's subsequent works laying the foundations of what nowadays is known as the

 Cartan-Kahler theory has been yet provided. This article represents a first attempt to

 remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs by focusing on Cartan's work on Pfaffian

 systems at the very beginning of the past century. The analysis of Cartan's relevant
 papers is preceded by a description of the historical context in which such contribu-

 tions were conceived. In this respect, special emphasis will be put on some works by
 Engel and von Weber on Pfaffian systems, which laid the basis for the subsequent

 geometrical developments of Cartan's theory of exterior differential systems.

 1 Introduction

 Historians and mathematicians are unanimous in considering Cartan's work on Pfaffian
 systems (what we would nowadays call exterior differential systems) as a landmark

 both for his own mathematical production and the development of twentieth century

 mathematics itself. The strategic role played by such systems in so many realms of

 mathematical research, such as the general theory of partial differential equations, Lie

 groups and the theory of equivalence and differential geometry, to mention only a few,
 is universally acknowledged.

 Cartan himself was quite definite in assessing the importance of his work on total

 differential equations within his whole mathematical activity. Referring to the years
 when his attention was concentrated for the large part on developing his ideas on
 Pfaffian equations, he once wrote that those were years of calm and long meditation

 in which all the germs of his subsequent works were contained.1

 Nevertheless, it appears that scarce attention has been paid to this area of historical

 research thus far. Authoritative scholars2 have dealt with Pfaff 's problem and the foun-

 dation of exterior differential calculus in Cartan's early papers; however, no specific
 analysis of his subsequent works laying the foundations of what is nowadays known

 as the Cartan-Kahler theory has yet been provided. The present article represents a

 first partial attempt to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs.3

 2 Some technical preliminaries

 This section is devoted to some general remarks on the mathematics which we are
 about to deal with. Historical accuracy will not be main focus of attention here; we

 will limit ourselves to giving the necessary information that will be helpful in under-

 standing the discussion that follows. The interested reader can find a detailed historical

 account of this material in the paper by Hawkins (2005).

 The main topic of our discussion will be the problem of integration of differential

 systems of Pfaffian equations; thus, it seems appropriate to describe briefly what a
 Pfaffian equation is and what it means to integrate such equations. Moreover, it is
 useful to emphasize a crucial separation that has to be maintained in the theory and

 that will be of primary importance for our purposes: the distinction between the com-

 pletely integrable ( unbeschrankt integrable) case and the not completely integrable

 one.

 In modern terms, what nineteenth century mathematicians meant by a Pfaffian

 form in n variables can be identified with the local expression of a differential 1-form

 defined on a n-dimensional manifold. However, until 1899, when Cartan gave a sym-

 bolic definition of what he called a differential expression (< expression difference lie),

 it appears that no autonomous status was attributed to it. Instead, what was considered

 was interpreted as the occurrence of certain finite relations (to be determined) among

 During the nineteenth century, one of the main problem in the theory of Pfaffian

 equations was that of finding a canonical form for a ), that is, the problem of finding
 a suitable change of variables, yt = yi(x' , . . . , xn), so that the Pfaffian expression
 a) could be written in such a way as to contain the minimal number of variables.

 Clearly, the determination of such a canonical form coincides with the determination

 of the minimal number of integral equivalents of co = 0 and, consequently, with the

 individuation of the integral varieties of maximal dimension.

 The main results in this field were obtained by Frobenius (1877) in 1877 with the

 introduction of two notions: the bilinear covariant (bilineare Covariante ) and the class

 ( Classe ) of a Pfaffian expression.
 The bilinear covariant6 of co was defined by Frobenius as the following expression:

 i o . . 3 A/ dAj

 > aijdxihxj i o , with . . aij =

 i,j= 1 J

 OX J j OX(

 where d and 8 are differentials in different directions; the word covariant indi-

 cates the crucial property according to which if, under a change of coordinates

 x[ = <pi{xk),Y*Ajdxj - HA'jdxp then

 In the classical literature, one often finds the wording integral equivalents.

 5 The present-day definition of an integral variety of a 1-form is the same, only rephrased in different
 language: i : S ^ M is an integral submanifold of the equation a> = 0 if, and only if, the pullback of
 co, i*(co), vanishes identically.

 6 For a detailed historical account see Hawkins (2005, §6).

 An early application of this notion was Frobenius' analytical classification theorem

 for Pfaffian forms.7 Indeed, he considered the matrix

 _ - A' • • • An 0

 and defined the class of a Pfaffian form co as the number p = rk{M)+Jk(M ) ; this num-
 ber is invariant under an arbitrary change of coordinates. He then demonstrated that p

 is the minimal number of independent variables in terms of which co can be expressed.

 In other words, p individuates the canonical form to which co belongs: if p = 2r, then

 co = yr+'dy' H

 under appropriate changes of coordinates.

 Pfaffian system of type

 = a^idx H

 A second application of the bilinear covariant, of which Frobenius took great advan-

 tage, was the so-called integrability theorem for systems of Pfaffian equations. A

 was said to be completely integrable if it admits m independent integrals, that is, if it

 admits an integral variety of dimension n-m. Frobenius dealt with this special kind of

 Pfaffian systems en route to the proof of the analytical classification theorem for single

 Pfaffian equations. His main result was a characterization of complete integrability in

 terms of the properties of the bilinear co variants of (4):

 Theorem 1 (Frobenius, 1877) Given the system (4) ofm linearly independent Pfaffi-

 an equations , it is completely integrable if and only if the vanishing of all its bilinear

 covariants is an algebraic consequence of the system itself

 Frobenius' demonstration relied upon a result due to Clebsch which can now be inter-

 preted as the dual counterpart of Frobenius' theorem. Indeed, Clebsch (1866) devoted
 his attention to a generalization of Jacobi's theory of linear partial differential equa-

 tions by introducing the notion of complete ( vollstandig ) integrability. A system of

 linear partial differential equations of type

 Ai(f) = Xn^ + --- + Xi„§^= 0 (/ = 1

 0*1

 was said by Clebsch to be complete if all expressions (A,-, Aj)(f) = A/(A;(/)) -
 Ay (A/(/)) are linear combinations (in general with non-constant coefficients) of (5).
 He was able to demonstrate the following:

 7 Important results in this field were obtained by Darboux almost at the same time. However, Darboux did
 not submit them for publication immediately. A paper by Darboux (1882) on Pfaff's problem appeared in
 1882. For an analysis of Darboux' contribution and a comparison with Frobenius' approach, see Hawkins
 (2005, pp. 420-424).

 Theorem 2 (Clebsch, 1866) If the system (5) is complete , then it admits a system of

 n - r functionally independent solutions f' , . . . , fn~r.

 It turns out that requiring complete integrability of (4) is equivalent to the supposition

 that an appropriate system (actually, its dual8) of linear differential equations of type
 (5) is complete in the sense of Clebsch's definition; moreover, it should be observed

 that a system of integrals of (4) is also a system of solutions for (5) and vice versa.

 To conclude the present introductory section, we recall that if the integrability condi-

 tions of Theorem (1) are not satisfied, then, in general, co M cannot be expressed as a lin-

 ear combination of the total differentials of m appropriate functions fj(j = 1, . . . , m).
 If this is the case, then the system (4) is said to be not completely integrable. To be

 precise, one should distinguish further the case in which some (although not all) of
 the integrability conditions are satisfied from the case in which none of them is; in

 the former case, one speaks of incompletely integrable systems; in the latter, of non-

 integrable systems. Since the study of incompletely integrable systems can be traced

 back to the study of non-integrable ones, we will often ignore such a distinction in the
 following discussion.

 3 The state-of-the-art in the early 1890s

 Well after the publication in 1877 of the seminal work by Frobenius (1877), the prob-

 lem of finding solutions of not completely integrable Pfaffian systems remained open

 and almost untouched. As we have just seen, Frobenius was able to give necessary and

 sufficient conditions that guarantee the complete integrability of a given differential

 system. However, except for some brief remarks,9 no specific attention was paid by

 him to the more general problem of finding integral equivalents of not completely

 integrable systems of Pfaffian equations.

 A common feeling of inadequacy in relation to the state of the theory of Pfaffian

 systems of this more general kind was frequently expressed by mathematicians in the

 early 1890s. For instance, Forsyth (1890) complained about the lack of new results in

 this realm of the theory and tried to indicate a path to be followed in order to achieve a

 satisfying generalization of the study of a single non-exact Pfaffian equation to systems

 of many equations. As in the case of a single equation, he said, it is desirable to have

 the integral equivalent of the system as general as possible and, in order to fulfill this

 aim, he individuated three different steps: (i) the determination of the number of equa-
 tions in the integral equivalent of a non-integrable system; (ii) the deduction of some

 simple integral equivalent of such a system and finally, and (iii) the generalization of
 such an integral equivalent once it has been obtained.

 According to Forsyth, some advances had been achieved only with respect to step
 (i) by the work of Biermann (1885), who had demonstrated that the maximal dimen-

 8 It appears that Mayer was the first one to call attention over this dual connection in Mayer ( 1 872); see also
 Hawkins (2005, pp. 408-410). In this connection, Frobenius spoke of adjungirt or zugehdrig system. His
 characterization of duality was purely algebraic, as one can see in Frobenius (1877, §13) or Hawkins (2005,
 pp. 411-415). Engel's interpretation in terms of infinitesimal transformations is discussed in §4 below.

 sion of the integral varieties of an unconditioned10 Pfaffian system is given by the

 integer part of the ratio between the number of variables and the number of equa-

 tions augmented by one, and that the rest of this division gives information about the

 degree of indeterminacy of the integral solutions. As far as the remaining two steps

 were concerned, Biermann's analysis had made it clear that the methods of integration

 known at that time (in particular Clebsch's so-called second method) did not permit a

 general solution to be obtained. Forsyth's effective synthesis of the state-of-the-art of

 the theory is worth quoting:

 And so the solution of the problem of obtaining the integral equivalent of
 a simultaneous system of unconditioned Pfaffians does not appear possible
 by any methods at present known which are effective for the case of a single

 Pfaffian. It is, in fact, one of the most general problems of the integral calculus;

 the discovery of its solution lies in the future.11

 4 EngePs invariants theory of Pfaffian systems

 Quite similar remarks of dissatisfaction about the state-of-the-art of the theory were

 expressed by Engel (1890) at the beginning of the first of two memoirs that were ded-

 icated to the invariant theory of Pfaffian systems and were communicated by Mayer
 in 1889 and in 1890 to the Sachsische Akademie der Wissenschaft in Leipzig. Engel
 wrote:

 The invariant theory of a single Pfaffian equation has been completed for
 some time; on the contrary, as far as systems of Pfaffian equations are con-

 cerned, almost everything remains to be done.12

 Engel's approach was deeply influenced by the work of his highly respected master

 Sophus Lie. Moreover, it appears that the main concern that led him to deal with such

 systems of total differentials equations was their application to the theory of continu-

 ous groups of transformations. Nonetheless, Engel's contributions are of considerable

 historical interest since they represented a source of inspiration for the later papers by
 von Weber and Cartan himself.

 4.1 Invariant correspondences

 Engel's strategy was dominated by the persistent recourse to structures invariantly
 connected to the given Pfaffian system. The very first example of such connected
 structures had been the so-called bilinear covariant of a Pfaffian expression upon
 which Frobenius had constantly relied in his work. Engel took up this fertile idea and

 10 An unconditioned Pfaffian system is one in which no specification of the coefficients of the Pfaffian
 system has been made.

 generalized it by proposing the following definition: two differential systems (depend-

 ing on the circumstances, a differential system can be a system of partial differential

 equations, a system of Pfaffian equations or a set of infinitesimal transformations) are

 said to be invariantly associated ( invariant verkniipft) if a bijective correspondence
 exists between them that is preserved under arbitrary changes of coordinates. The

 knowledge of these connected structures, as in the case of a single Pfaffian equation

 or in the case of a complete system of Pfaffian equations examined by Frobenius, was

 considered quite useful by Engel since the study of their properties allowed him to get

 information, for example, on the normal form of the original Pfaffian system.

 The starting point of his analysis was the observation that a reciprocal connection

 ( Zusammenhang ) exists between Pfaffian systems and systems of linear homogeneous

 partial differential equations of the first order. According to Engel, the origin of this

 connection stemmed from two distinct interpretations that one could ascribe to a given

 system of m Pfaffian equations of the following form:

 (On = ^afli(x'...txn)dxi = 0 (/z = 1, (6)

 n

 i=i

 One could interpret (6), in the usual way, as a system of differential equations and,

 correspondingly, one could undertake the task to determine all its integral equivalent

 equations, that is, to determine all the equations

 = 0,...,<t>q(x'...xn) = 0,

 such that the 2 q relations

 4>1 = 0, . . ., <&q = 0, d<$> i = 0, . . d<&q - 0,

 imply identically eo^ = 0, /i = 1, . . ., m. On the other hand, Engel explained, one
 could regard the quantities dx' , . . ., dxn in (6) as the infinitesimal increments to which

 the variables x' , . . ., xn are subject as a consequence of the action of an infinitesimal
 transformation

 n df

 ,= 1 dxJ

 According to this interpretation, Eq. 6 define a family ( Schaar ) of infinitesimal trans-

 formations, namely the set of all infinitesimal transformations X(f) that satisfy the
 following m relations:

 j= i

 Since the rank of the matrix A = [a^j ] is supposed to be maximal (and so equal to

 404 A. Cogliati

 m < n ), Eq. 7 admits n - m linearly independent solutions §> , for i = 1, . . ., n and
 k = 1 , . . /i - m. Therefore one obtains n-m linearly independent infinitesimal
 transformations:

 ik)

 n df

 Xk(f) = Yif)(x i

 «=i

 which are the generators of the set of infinitesimal transformations that is associated

 to the given Pfaffian system (6). An arbitrary transformation of this set takes on the
 following expression:

 Wif) = Xl(*l, . . ;Xn)Xi(f) + . . . + Xn-m(x 1, . . Xn)Xn-m(f), (8)

 where the x/ (i = 1, . . w - m) are arbitrary functions of n variables.

 Engel observed that this reciprocal correspondence between Pfaffian systems and

 sets of infinitesimal transformations is not only bijective but it is also preserved under

 arbitrary transformations of coordinates, so that it is, in fact, an example of invariant

 association. Finally, by setting all these transformations equal to zero, one obtains the

 following system of independent differential equations:

 X'(f) = 0, . . . , Xn-m(f) = 0.

 which is also invariantly connected with (6).

 This dual connection was used by Engel to build up new auxiliary Pfaffian systems

 which introduce a remarkable simplification in the theory. The first of these auxiliary

 systems is obtained as a consequence of the action of a generic infinitesimal transfor-

 mation of type (8) on the Pfaffian system (6), now supposed to be rewritten (aufgeldst)

 in the following form13:

 = dx,i - ^ am+k^dxm+k =0 O = 1

 n-m

 *=l

 Correspondingly, the infinitesimal transformations which are associated with it are
 now written as:

 Am+k(f) =

 dxm+k T?. 9x^

 If we define W (/) to be a generic transformation:

 W(f) = X Xm+kAm+k(f),

 n-m

 k = 1

 its action on (9) transforms the latter into the system14:

 (/x = 1, . . m)

 which is easily demonstrated to be equivalent and invariantly connected to the follow-

 ing system of Pfaffian equations:

 Ai = 0, . . ., Am = 0, Am+k Ai = 0, . . Am+k Am = 0 (k = 1, . . n - m).(10)

 Finally, a few manipulations give the following equivalent and simplified form written
 in terms of the coefficients of Frobenius's bilinear covariants:

 dXfi i Qm+k^dXm+k. = 0,

 ' ] {Am+icam+j,ii ~ Am+jam+k,iA}dxm+k - 0 (H)

 (/x = 1, j = 1, w -m).

 Engel observed that it may happen that the system (11) coincides with (9); if this is
 the case, then (9) is completely integrable and it admits every infinitesimal transfor-

 mation (8), that is, for a generic transformation W (/), W A ^ = 0 (/x = 1 , . . m), are
 a consequence of AM = 0 (/x = 1, . . m).

 In virtue of the dual correspondence between Pfaffian systems and sets of infinites-

 imal transformations, the system (11) can be considered as defining a set (Schaar) of

 infinitesimal transformations. It turns out that these transformations are precisely those

 transformations that leave the original Pfaffian system (9) invariant and, moreover, as

 Engel demonstrated that the Pfaffian system (11) is completely integrable. Using
 anachronistic terminology, we can call such transformations characteristic transfor-

 mations and, correspondingly, the Pfaffian system (11) defining them a characteristic

 system.

 A second differential system invariantly connected to (9) was obtained by Engel
 as a consequence of the following simple remark. If one considers a system of n - m
 linear homogeneous partial differential equations of the following form:

 Ck(f) = ^Pik(x', . = 0 (k = l,...,n-m), (12)

 n df

 ;=i 0Xi

 14 The expression W is what today we would call Lie derivative of with respect to the vector
 field W. From a historical point of view, such a denomination is very appropriate. Actually, Lie was the
 first person to introduce it, see, for example, Lie (1888, pp. 529-530).

 and the system of equations

 (Q, Cj)(f) = Ck(Cj(f )) - Cj(Ck(f )) = 0,
 Q(/) = 0 (k,j = l,...,n-m),

 then they are invariantly associated. Since there is an adjoint Pfaffian system associ-
 ated to every system of linear homogeneous partial differential equations, it is clear

 that two systems of Pfaffian equations which are invariantly connected correspond to

 (12) and (13). As a result of this, Engel stated the following:

 Theorem 3 The system of Pfaffian equations which is dual to the system of partial
 differential equations

 Am+kf = = 0

 (Am+ki Am+j)f = 2/z=l(^/n+ifctfm+y'Ai = 0
 (kj = I, . . .,n -m),

 is invariantly connected to the Pfaffian system (9).

 Other differential systems invariantly connected to the given Pfaffian system were

 obtained by Engel in the course of his research. However, the function they fulfilled

 was always the same: to deduce from them the normal form of the Pfaffian system

 under consideration and to develop applications in the realm of the theory of contin-

 uous groups and of the theory of contact transformations as well. To name just a few

 concrete examples, Engel succeeded in giving a complete invariant theory of Pfaffian

 systems of two equations in four independent variables; furthermore, he utilized some

 of his results to give a simpler treatment of the problem, already faced by Page (1888),

 of the classification of all imprimitive continuous transformation groups in space in
 four dimensions15 and, finally, he was able to present a very clear demonstration of a

 theorem originally due to Backlund (1876) which gave a complete characterization of
 all contact transformations.

 5 von Weber's contributions: 1898-1900

 As Goursat (1922, p. 259) was once to observe, before Cartan's seminal papers Cartan

 (1901a,b) the first rigorous results in the field of the theory of general Pfaffian systems

 were obtained, along with Engel, by the young mathematician Eduard Ritter von Weber

 A group of r independent infinitesimal transformations in n variables is said to be imprimitive if it leaves

 where the Q are some functions of <f>' , . . . , (f)n-q ; see (Page, 1888, pp. 297-300).

 On the genesis of the Cartan-Kahler theory 407

 (1870-1934) in a series of articles which laid the basis for the subsequent geometrical

 developments of Cartan's theory of exterior differential systems, von Weber's approach

 was profoundly inspired by Engel's researches. Wide use of invariantly associated dif-

 ferential systems, frequent application of infinitesimal characteristic transformations

 and consistent reference to geometrical visualization were for von Weber, as well as

 for Engel, the main technical and conceptual tools to which to tackle the resolution of

 generalized Pfaffian systems.

 Nonetheless, it appears that a specific motivation guided von Weber's interest in

 his attempt to classify the large variety of Pfaffian systems, that is, the hope of apply-

 ing Pfaffian systems to the systematic study of general system of partial differential

 equations already begun by Meray and Riquier. Moreover, von Weber took advantage

 of some of the main results of the general theory of systems of partial differential
 equations, namely existence theorems for the so-called passive systems16 which he
 used to demonstrate the existence of integral varieties of the given Pfaffian system
 and the consequent possibility of writing it in a simple normal form containing a

 reduced number of differentials. Finally, a regular application of the theory of linear
 complexes and congruences in projective space has to be noted as one of the most
 original technical innovations introduced by von Weber into the theory.17

 The contributions of von Weber that we are interested in are spread over a certain
 number of memoirs which he published between 1898 and 1900. Our attention will
 be mainly concentrated on von Weber (1898a), in which the notion of character of a

 Pfaffian system and that of derived system were introduced for the first time. Never-

 theless, since it appears that some of his later developments may have played a role in

 influencing Cartan's geometrical approach to a generalization of the problem of Pfaff,

 a brief survey of von Weber (1900a,b,c) will also be given.

 5.1 Character and characteristic transformations

 As von Weber himself observed in the final historical remarks of von Weber (1900c,

 p. 609), since the introduction of the bilinear covariant by Frobenius and Darboux,

 lb An explanation of this intricate notion will be given below.

 17 The following remarks taken from the introduction to von Weber (1901) are quite enlightening. There
 von Weber wrote:

 If our task can be considered as a special case of the general theory of differential systems, it is
 also true that, from another point of view, the latter can be regarded as a special case of the former.

 Yet, the new auxiliary means that we will utilize in our analysis and that will be connected in many
 ways to the theory of differential systems, is represented by the theory of linear complexes and
 congruences in (m - 1) -dimensional space as well as by the theory of families of antisymmetric
 bilinear forms in 2m variables.

 ('Unsere Aufgabe lasst sich als Specialfall der allgemeinen Theorie der Differentialsysteme auffas-
 sen, wie sich auch umgekehrt die letztere, von einem andern Standpunkt aus betrachtet, der ersteren
 als Specialfall einordnet. Das neue Hilfsmittel jedoch, das wir bei unseren Untersuchungen verwen-
 den und mit der Theorie der Differentialsysteme in mannigfache Beziehung setzen werden ist die
 Theorie der Liniencomplexe und -Congruenzen in m - 1 -dimensionalen Raum, also der Schaaren
 von alternirenden Bilinearformen mit m Variabelnpaaren'.)

 invariantly associated structures had played a major role in the theory of Pfaffian
 systems. Engel had taken great advantage of them and had succeeded in providing
 some new applications of Pfaffian equations especially in the classification problem

 of continuous groups of transformations, von Weber acknowledged the fruitfulness of

 this approach and tried to give it systematic basis within the context of an invariants

 theory of systems of Pfaffian equations.

 von Weber (1898a) began his analysis by considering a system of n - m Pfaffian

 equations in the following, resolved form18:

 Ys = dxm+s -^asidxi = 0, (s = l,...,n-m). (15)

 Engel had proved that the differential system for two independent variations dxi and
 8xi of the n variables jq, . . . , xn(i = 1, . . . , n)

 dxm+s = ^ ClsidXi', 8xm+s = ^ClsiSXi, /___i ' / 1
 £?=1 Zr= i aiksdxi8xk = 0, (J /___i - 1, » m). ' (16) / 1

 is invariantly associated with (15). 19 As a consequence of this, von Weber observed

 that the study of invariant quantities attached to (15) could be transferred to that of the

 invariants of the system (16). He defined the first of these invariants, the character K

 of the system (15), as the rank of the matrix

 m

 ^atksh (i = 1, • • • , m, s - 1, . . . , n - m),
 Jt=i

 when x' , . . . , xn and X' , . . . , Xm assume arbitrary values.

 The importance of the notion of character lay in the fact that it offered a first classifi-

 cation criterion for the large variety of Pfaffian systems, and a measure of the degree of

 difficulty of the problem one has to face, as it were: the greater the character, the harder
 is the task to undertake. If, for example, K - 0 then the system (15) is completely
 integrable, since clearly the coefficients of the bilinear covariants vanish identically.
 von Weber's attention (1898a) was almost exclusively concentrated on Pfaffian

 systems of character one , but some important results concerning characteristic trans-

 formations were obtained for the general case too. Since characteristic transformations
 will also play a key role in Cartan's analysis, it seems appropriate to describe their
 frequent use in von Weber's theory in some detail.

 Already introduced by Engel, characteristic transformations are defined as the
 infinitesimal transformations which are dually associated with (15) and, at the same
 time, leave these equations invariant; that is, if we consider a generic infinitesimal

 As already pointed out by Engel and proved by von Weber through a direct compu-
 tation, the system of h differential equations X; (/) = 0 is complete in the sense of
 Clebsch's definition.21 von Weber acknowledged the importance of such transforma-

 tions, and explained how they could be usefully employed to simplify the integration
 of the Pfaffian system under consideration. In particular, he proved the following:

 Theorem 4 For the Pfaffian system (15) to be reducible through a change of coordi-

 nates to a system of equations inn - h variables , it is necessary and sufficient that it

 admits h ( independent ) characteristic infinitesimal transformations.

 20 A modern version of this formula would read as follows: X(V5) = dVs(X) + d(Vs(X)). Cartan is

 usually acknowledged as its first discoverer, see Ivey (2003, p. 339). However, this attribution appears to
 be not very accurate from a historical point of view. Indeed, it can be found already in Engel (1896, p. 415).

 21 In modern terms, that means that the operators X/(/ = 1, . . . , h) define an involutive distribution of

 tangent vector fields. See Sect. 2 above.

 Indeed, if one introduces a change of coordinates in which n - h variables are

 identified with the n - h independent solutions of the complete system (19), it is easy

 to show that the Pfaffian system so obtained only depends upon these n-h variables.22

 5.2 Pfaffian systems of character one, I

 The remaining part of the memoir (von Weber 1 898a) was devoted to a thorough analy-

 sis of a very special type of Pfaffian systems, namely those whose character is equal to

 one. Since Cartan would take up the same topic in 1901 by reinterpreting von Weber's
 result in the light of his new geometrical methods based on the brand new exterior
 differential calculus, it appears appropriate to discuss von Weber's achievements in

 order to facilitate a comparison between Cartan's and von Weber's approaches.

 Pfaffian systems of character one represent the simplest case one can conceive

 after the case of completely integrable systems. Frobenius had showed that if the
 system is completely integrable, then the vanishing of all its bilinear covariants is
 an algebraic consequence of the equations of the system itself. Instead, in the case

 of systems of character one the bilinear covariants reduce to a single bilinear form

 whose vanishing is not implied by the equations of the system itself. In other words,
 the following relations among the coefficients of the bilinear covariants hold: aiks =

 (s = 2, . . . , n - m' i, k = 1, . . . , m), where the /jls are functions of the n

 variables x' , . . . , xn. von Weber supposed that the matrix [a/fciKi, k = 1, . . . , m) has

 rank equal to 2v, so that he could deduce the existence of m - 2v linearly independent
 characteristic transformations

 *(t)/ = X*/(4);r-. dXi k = 1

 ;= l dXi

 As already explained, the existence of such transformations was exploited to obtain a

 reduced form of the Pfaffian system under examination; indeed, by appropriate defi-

 nition of new variables y' , . . . , yv+' , . . . , yv+n-m, the number of differentials can be

 lowered to v + n - m to give the following reduced form of (15)23:

 dyv+s = ^ (5 = 1

 V

 i=i

 von Weber's treatment of this special type of systems was marked by the definite
 and profitable distinction between the case in which 2v = 2 and the case in which

 2v > 2. Let us consider in some detail the case 2v > 2. The study of such systems was

 carried out by exploiting the existence of the so-called derived system (das abgeleitete
 System von (15)) which in this case turns out to be completely integrable. Indeed,

 22 For details, see von Weber (1898a, pp. 210-211). A modern statement of this theorem can be found in
 Olver (1995, p. 430).

 23 It should be observed that, in general, the are functions of the n variables x' , . . . , xn.

 and demonstrated that it is complete in the sense of Clebsch. In fact, as (A/ A*)(/) =

 as a linear combination (in general with non-constant coefficients) of the A, (/)'s

 from the first column and the first row vanish. As a consequence of antisymme-

 try, all principal minors of order four vanish and consequently,26 either the rank of

 <J>0/ = - O/o = ( BAi ) - B{f) • B(a'i) = 0 and so the system (20) is complete. From

 the complete integrability of the system (20), von Weber straightforwardly derived the

 complete integrability of what he called the derived Pfaffian system of (15):

 V, - /x5Vi = 0 (s = 2, 3, . . ., n - m). (23)

 non vanishing principal minor of order r exists.

 its integral equivalents, he was finally able to provide a normal form for (15) given by

 the system

 (dziv+' dZ2v+2 = = 0, Zv+'dz' dZ2v+3 + = zv+idz2 0, . . . , dz2v+n-m H

 dZ2v+2 = 0, dZ2v+3 = 0, . . . , dz2v+n-m = 0,

 where z' , . . . , Z2v+i are appropriate functions of x' , . . . , xn. We will see later Car-

 tan's reinterpretation of the notion of derived system. For the time being, it should
 be observed, as von Weber did, that the derived system (23) represents an example
 of differential structure invariantly connected to (15) in the sense of Engel's defini-

 tion. Indeed von Weber's derived system (23) does coincide with the Pfaffian system
 introduced by Engel in Theorem 3.

 5.3 Reducibility of a Pfaffian system to its normal form

 Although von Weber (1898a) analysis can certainly be considered as a remarkable

 progress by comparison with years of relative stagnation, the results therein contained

 were of an unsystematic kind and often limited to very particular cases (e.g., character
 equal to one, as we have seen in the previous paragraph). Over the following years,
 von Weber tried to remedy this inconvenience and developed a more organic theory
 which in principle could be applied to Pfaffian systems of a general type. A crucial
 role, as we will see, was played by geometrical insight and by frequent reliance upon

 the theory of linear complexes and linear congruences in projective spaces.

 As for von Weber's results in this period, the following account is mainly based upon

 von Weber (1900a, b). I will linger on some details, since in von Weber's papers for the

 first time we encounter problems, results and technical tools of great importance for

 the development of Cartan's geometrical theory of exterior differential systems. When

 discussing Cartan's papers, I will endeavour to indicate limits and relative importance
 of his debt to von Weber.

 At the beginning, von Weber (1900a) singled out the main problem in the theory of

 general Pfaffian equations as the following question (indeed, a genuine generalization

 of the problem of Pfaff for a single total differential equation):

 Problem 1 What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the system (15) to be

 reducible to the following ( normal ) form

 X

 «=i

 Fshdfs=0 (h = l,...,n-m), (25)

 containing only x differentials , where f' , . . . , fT are independent functions of
 x' , . . . , xn and r indicates an integer not smaller than n - m and not greater than
 n-2?11

 27 The reason for these limitations is easily explained: if r = n - 1 , then one is brought back to the problem
 of determining 1 -dimensional integral manifolds of (15); if, on the other hand, r = n - m, this means that
 the system (15) is completely integrable and so Frobenius' theory can be applied.

 Y,Mfk)dxi= 0, J^Ai(fk)Sxi= 0 (k = l,...,p)29 (28)

 von Weber observed that the same problem can be considered from a different, more
 geometrical perspective whose usefulness Cartan would thoroughly examine in his
 work.

 If the Pfaffian system (15) can be rewritten in the normal form (25), then the equa-

 tions

 As already observed by Frobenius,28 if the Pfaffian system (15) admits a normal form

 of type (25), then the system of r equations

 dxm+h=y^Maihdxi' df'=0, . . . , dfp=0 (h=', . . . , n-m' p=r-n+m) (26)

 m

 ;=i

 is completely integrable. Thus, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence
 of the normal form (25) is that the n - m bilinear forms

 Q(dx, 8x) = ^r^^r^aucsdxi8icx (s = 1, - m) (27)

 vanish as a consequence of the following relations:

 m m

 ;=l k= l

 m m

 represent (for arbitrary values of the c/'s) an integral equivalent of (15), that is, an

 (n - t) -dimensional integral variety, which von Weber indicated with Mn-T. If Eq. 29

 are replaced by their equivalent parametric expression

 X[ =</>;(«!,..., My) ( i = 1, . . . , n' v = n - r), (30)

 28 See Frobenius (1877, §20).

 29 This is a good point at which the following important observation should be made: in the classical
 literature no conceptual and notational distinction was made between basis elements of what we would
 nowadays call cotangent space and the components of tangent vectors. If one cannot resist the temptation to
 restore such a distinction, it should be observed that in formulas (27) and (28) the dxi 's and the Sx ; 's have

 to be regarded as components of tangent vectors whereas in formula (26) the dx[ 's and dfa 's are indeed to
 be considered as elements of a cotangent space. Clearly, this comes as no surprise in so far as the theory
 lacks a formal definition of what a differential form is. Somehow more surprising is the discovery that even

 Cartan's theory was affected by this 'flaw'.

 then these functions are solutions of a first order differential system, to be indicated

 with the symbol Sv, which takes on the following form30:

 414 A. Cogliati

 '^ = Zr=l^£ (r = l, v; h = l

 (31)

 Sli Z*=l aikh §% = 0 (r,s = l,...,v;k = l,...,n-m).

 Thus, if the differential system Sv is such that there is a Mn-X integral variety through

 every point (jc0, jc°, . . . , x„) of a certain domain of the whole variety Mn , then the
 Pfaffian system admits the normal form (25). In this way, problem (1) was traced
 back to the analysis of the conditions guaranteeing the existence of solutions of the

 differential system Sv.

 It was at this very point that von Weber used the theory of the so-called general

 systems of partial differential equations developed by Meray and Riquier among oth-
 ers.31 As we will see below, a crucial role was played by the notion of passivity (or
 involution) which assures, under regularity conditions, the existence of integrals of

 the system itself.

 If one adds to the system Sv all the equations that can be obtained from Sv through

 repeated derivations (finite in numbers), one of the following two cases must occur:
 either a contradiction, that is, a relation among the variables x' , . . . , xn only is pro-

 duced, or a differential system is obtained that can be put in the so-called canonical
 passive form £ by solving it with respect to certain partial derivatives.32 If this is
 the case and if v constants w0 , . . . , are arbitrarily chosen, the system Sv admits a

 simple statement, see, e.g., Amaldi (1942, pp. 1 10-1 12).

 31 For a historical account of the theory, see, e.g., Riquier's remarks in the preface to Ref. Riquier (1910).

 32 I will not insist on detail. For further details, see Riquier's papers (Riquier 1893) and his treatise (Riquier

 1910) or von Weber's encyclopaedia article (von Weber 1900d) on partial differential equations. Here I limit

 myself to the following, few remarks. The expression canonical form means a system (to be indicated with
 S) of equations of type:

 On the other hand, passivity coincides with the following hypothesis: if the partial derivatives contained

 with respect to u ' , . . . , uv are called principal , and the remaining ones, along with the dependent variables

 x' , . . . , jcn, are called parametric quantities, then it is required that from £ and from equations deduced by

 E through differentiation, every principal derivative is required to be expressed in terms of the parametric
 quantities in a unique way.

 and also provided that the n power series (the sum being extended to all parametric

 converge in a certain region of Cn. In this way, the admissibility of a normal form of

 type (25) and the consequent existence of n - r -dimensional integral varieties of the

 Pfaffian system was characterized by von Weber in terms of the possibility to write
 the differential system Sv in a canonical passive (involutive) form. Moreover, as he
 observed, to establish whether such an eventuality was fulfilled or not, reduced, at

 least in principle, to a simple procedure consisting of differentiations and eliminations

 to be operated on Sv.

 At this point, von Weber made an interesting observation that was to assume a role of

 outstanding importance in Cartan's theory. Motivated by the possibility of developing

 fruitful applications in the realm of the theory of general partial differential equations,

 he introduced further hypotheses which guarantee the existence of integral varieties

 of increasing dimensions. Indeed, he explained, if one supposes that the system Sv
 can be put in a canonical passive form simply by solving it with respect to certain

 derivatives |^- and, furthermore, if one supposes that from Sv and from equations
 obtained from it bv differentiation and elimination no relation can be deduced among

 the variables jc/, J^-, . . . , (i = 1, . . . , ri), already contained in Sv-i» and so
 on for the systems Sv-', . . . , Si, then every 1-dimensional integral variety of (15)
 Mi belongs at least to one 2-dimensional integral variety Mi, etc. and, finally, every
 v - 1-dimensional integral variety Mv-i belongs at least to one v-dimensional integral

 variety Mv.

 Thus, von Weber arrived at the statement of what I will refer to as the second

 problem of his theory of Pfaffian systems.

 Problem 2 What are the necessary and sufficient conditions that have to be satis-
 fied so that every ' -dimensional integral variety M' of (15) belongs at least to one
 2-dimensional integral variety M2, etc. and so that every v - I -dimensional integral

 variety Mv-' belongs at least to one v -dimensional integral variety Mv ?

 Clearly, both for Problems 1 and 2, the aim was that of expressing such conditions by
 means of algebraic and differential relations among the coefficients aSi (s = 1 , . . . ,

 n - m ; i = 1 , . . . , m) only. For instance, it turns out that a necessary condition for the

 tence of a system of linearly independent functions?;- ' (i = 1, . . . , m' s = 1, . . . , v)

 satisfying the following bilinear equations:

 A detailed account of von Weber's relevant achievements would go well beyond our
 present purposes; I will limit myself to a few observations. His analysis was mainly
 based on the theory of bilinear forms and, more precisely, on the classification of
 linear complexes and linear congruences in (m - 1) -dimensional33 projective spaces.
 This should come as no surprise, since the coefficients of the bilinear covariants,

 aiks » (i,k = 1 , . . . , m' s = 1 , . . . , n - m) were interpreted by von Weber geometri-

 cally as defining a system of linear complexes, equal in number to the character K of
 (15):

 m m

 i= 1 k= 1

 (* = 1> •••>*)• (35)

 In this geometrical context, von Weber identified the characteristic transformations

 Xi(f) = 27=1 %j ^ = 1' • • • ' ^) as those for which the components repre-
 sent the singular points of the congruence consisting of all the straight lines belonging
 to complexes (35). von Weber was able to give a detailed analysis of Pfaffian sys-
 tems with m = 3, 4, 5, 6 but ultimately, despite his hopes,34 his approach did not
 succeed in providing a general theory of unlimited validity. Nevertheless, he should
 be acknowledged for opening a new phase in the studies of general Pfaffian systems

 by assessing some of the problems to be considered relevant, and also for introducing

 useful technical tools which were destined to outlive his theory and to be reinterpreted

 in the light of Cartan's exterior differential calculus.

 6 The foundations of the exterior differential calculus

 After the completion of his doctoral thesis (Cartan 1894), where he gave a rigorous and

 complete treatment of the classification of finite-dimensional, semi-simple, complex
 Lie algebras already considered by Killing, Cartan devoted himself for some years
 to applications of the theoretical results contained therein. The theory of partial dif-
 ferential equations appears to have been one of the main fields of his interest. This
 emerges quite clearly, for example, from the reading of the dense memoir Cartan
 (1896) devoted to the theory of those systems of partial differential equations whose

 33 The number m, that is the difference between the number of variables and the number of equations of
 which the system (15) consists, was called by von Weber die Stufe and it was considered by him, along
 with the character , as a measure of the difficulties one has to face in tackling the study of a given system
 of Pfaffian equations. See von Weber (1901, p. 387).

 solutions depend only upon arbitrary constants, and such that they admit a continuous

 group of transformations.

 Cartan's work (1899) on Pfaffian forms, and more specifically on Pfaff's problem,

 was part of this interest. Indeed, as Lie had shown, the integration of partial differential

 equations and the integration of Pfaffian forms were considered as equivalent formu-
 lations of the same problem. As Katz (1985) and Hawkins (2005) have already given
 a full, authoritative account of the material contained in Cartan (1899), I will limit

 myself to recall the main notions, which will be useful in the rest of our discussion.

 Cartan organized his treatment in a deductive way by first presenting a full set

 of definitions and conventions. He started by giving a symbolic definition of what a

 differential expression in n variables is; this was defined as a homogenous expression

 built up by means of a finite number of additions and multiplications of the n differen-

 tials dx' , . . . , dxn as well as of certain coefficients which are functions of x' , . . . , xn.

 In this way, a Pfaffian expression was defined as a differential expression of degree

 one such as A'dx' H

 example, by A'dx2 A dx' + A2dx$ A dxi?5

 A very important notion of Cartan's new calculus was the exterior multiplication of
 two differential expressions.36 Cartan himself observed that he had realized back in

 1896 that the formulas for the change of variables in multiple integrals could be easily

 derived by submitting the differentials under the integration sign to appropriate laws of
 calculation, which coincide with Grassmann's exterior calculus. By developing such

 an intuition, in 1899 he was able to present convincing arguments to justify such rules,

 which relied upon the idea of the value of a differential form.

 To this end, Cartan considered a differential expression co of degree h and then sup-

 posed that the n variables involved are functions of h arbitrary parameters {a ' , . . . , an ) .

 Indicating by , . . . , fih) one of the h' permutations of the parameters ot' , . . . , an,
 Cartan associated to it the value that co assumes when the differentials occupying the

 ith (/ = 1, . . . , h) position are replaced by the corresponding derivative of x with

 respect to $ . By attributing to such a quantity the sign + or - depending on the parity

 of the permutation considered, and then by summing over all h' permutations, Cartan

 finally obtained what he called the value of the differential expression. For example,
 the value of the differential form A'dx2 A dx' + A2dx$ A dx 2 is:

 ^ 1 dX2 dx' ^ ^ 9jC3 9*3 ^ 1 dX2 dx j ^ ^ 8x3 dx2

 1 9g?I da2 ^ ^ 9of 1 9C*2 ^ 1 9Q?2 9C*I ^ ^ 9c*2 9ori

 At this point, Cartan defined two differential expressions of degree h to be equiva-
 lent if their value is the same independently of the choice of parameters a' , . . . , a/j.
 In this way, he was able to establish Grassmann's well-known multiplication rules,
 which were to be interpreted, in Cartan's view, as equalities between equivalence clas-
 ses of exterior differential forms. For example, one has dx 1 A dx2 = -dx 2 A dx' or

 35 Cartan did not employ the wedge product symbol A.

 36 One can find the germs of this crucial notion already in some of Poincare's work on integral invariants.

 dx 4 Adx4 = 0, as is easy to see on calculating the values of the differential expressions
 appearing in the equations.

 A second crucial novelty of Cartan's theory was the exterior derivative of a given
 Pfaffian expression,37 which he explicitly connected with Frobenius' and Darboux's
 notion of bilinear covariant. Cartan's definition reads as follows. Given a Pfaffian form

 418 A. Cogliati

 like A'dx' H

 ct)f - dA' A dx' H

 The invariant character of such a derivative is then established by relying on the notion

 of value on observing that if a) indicates the expression of co with respect to a new set of

 coordinates yi(x) then the differential forms of degree two co' and (&>)' are equivalent
 in the sense specified above.

 On the basis of this new calculus, Cartan was not only able to reformulate all

 the known results in the theory of Pfaffian equations, including Frobenius' analytical
 classification theorem,39 but he also to succeed in obtaining remarkable new results

 about the resolution of systems that consist of a single Pfaffian equation and a certain

 number of finite relations.40 These were particularly relevant for the theory of partial
 differential equations of first order.

 7 Cartan's theory of general Pfaffian systems

 After laying the foundations of his new exterior differential calculus, Cartan devoted

 himself to the study of integrable systems of Pfaffian equations that are not completely.

 As with von Weber, and in accordance with the motivations driving Cartan (1899), it

 appears that the main reason for this was the many applications of Pfaffian expressions

 to the theory of partial differential equations.

 Cartan (1901a) began his analysis by recalling Biermann's41 efforts to determine the

 maximal dimension and the degree of indeterminacy of integral varieties of uncondi-

 tioned Pfaffian systems. In this respect, Cartan complained about the lack of rigorous
 (not generic) and systematic results, and emphasized the urgency of providing the
 theory with solid theoretical grounds in order to remedy this unsatisfactory state of
 affairs.

 As observed by Hawkins (2005, p. 430), a key role was played by the notion of
 the bilinear covariant which, as we have seen, Cartan interpreted as the first exterior

 derivative of a Pfaffian form. However, one should not forget that the use of such a

 notion was not Cartan's alone since, as we have seen, it was quite frequently employed

 by other mathematicians. Instead, what characterizes Cartan's approach with respect

 37 The definition was generalized to include derivatives of differential forms of degree greater than one in
 Cartan (1901b, p. 243).

 38 The notation dco was introduced by Kahler (1934, p. 6).

 On the genesis of the Cartan-Kahler theory 4 1 9

 to his contemporaries was the ubiquitous recourse to geometrical insight, and the
 foundational role of his exterior differential calculus which introduced considerable

 simplifications in the theory.

 7.1 Geometrical representation

 It seems that Lie had been the first one to attribute a geometrical interpretation to the

 system of Pfaffian equations (15) in the context of his synthetic approach to differ-
 ential equations. Engel took it from Lie and profitably applied it to his researches in
 Engel (1890) by writing:

 We can attribute to the system (15) also an illustrative representation. Indeed,

 through the equations (15), to every point of the space x' , . . . , xn the corre-

 sponding plane bundle of directions: dx' : dx2 : • • • : dxn , is associated. If in
 every point of the space the corresponding bundle of directions is considered

 then one obtains a figure which is the exact image of the system (15).42

 von Weber himself took great advantage of such a geometrical representation and

 even widened it by introducing for the first time (in September 1900, see von Weber

 (1900b)) the notion of an element of a Pfaffian system as the set of directions tangent

 to the integral variety of the system itself.

 Clearly inspired by this long-standing tradition, Cartan opened his analysis in Cartan
 (1901a) by emphasizing the importance of geometrical representations in the prob-
 lems he was about to deal with. Let us consider a system of Pfaffian equations of the

 following type:

 < . (36)

 co i = a''dx' H

 0)2 = a2'dx' H

 o)s = as'dx' -1

 Cartan supposed that n out of the r variables should be regarded as independent, so
 that the remaining r - n could be expressed as functions of them. In this way, a
 n-dimensional variety Mn of the r -dimensional total manifold43 was defined. Then,
 Cartan observed, the system (36) can be thought of geometrically as prescribing the
 conditions that have to be satisfied by the differentials dx' , . . . , dxr when one con-
 siders an arbitrary displacement on Mn . Furthermore, since the differentials dxt can

 be assimilated44 to the direction parameters of the tangent lines to the variety Mn ,

 42 'Man kann mit dem Sy steme ( 1 5) auch eine anschauliche Vorstellung verbinden. Durch die Gleichungen
 (15) wird namlich jedem Punkte des Raumes x', .. .,xn ein ebenes Biindel von oom_1 Fortschreitungs-
 richtungen: dx' : dx 2 : . . . : dxn zugeordnet. Denkt man sich in jedem Punkte des Raumes das zugehorige
 Biindel von Fortschreitungsrichtungen, so erhalt man eine Figur, welche das genaue geometrische Bild des
 Systems (15) ist'

 43 I designate with the expression total manifold the set of all the r-uples (jq , . . . , xr).

 44 Again, no distinction between base elements of cotangent spaces and components of tangent vectors
 was made.

 the system (36) can be interpreted as saying that, as a consequence of (36), these tan-

 gent lines belong to a certain linear variety ( multiplicite plane) which depends upon

 the point considered. Hence, the problem of finding n -dimensional integral varieties

 of (36) was traced back to the following:

 We associate to every point of the space a linear variety passing through this

 point; then we determine an w-dimensional variety Mn, such that in its every

 point all the tangents to the variety belong to the linear variety corresponding to

 420 A. Cogliati

 this point.45

 After setting the problem in precise geometrical terms, Cartan defined a linear ele-

 ment (i element lineaire) to be the set consisting of a point and a straight line passing
 through the point, which can be denoted (x, dx). Then, he specified a linear element

 to be integral if the differentials dx i, . . . , dxn, regarded as direction parameters of

 the tangent line of the linear element, satisfy the systems of linear equations obtained

 from (36) after evaluating the coefficients ay, (/ = 1, . . . , s; j = 1, . . . , r) at x. He
 finally arrived at the following proposition which characterized the integral varieties
 of (36).

 Proposition 1 For a variety to be integral is necessary and sufficient that every linear
 element of it be integral.

 The notion of linear element was then generalized by Cartan to a greater number of

 dimensions. Indeed, a /^-dimensional element was defined to be the couple consisting
 of a point and a linear variety passing through the point. Cartan indicated it with the

 symbol Ep. It was clear that every /7-dimensional element Ep of an integral variety
 Mn (necessarily p < n) consists of integral linear elements; however, as already
 observed by von Weber,46 Ep has to satisfy further conditions which, in general,47
 are not algebraically implied by (36); they are the relations obtained by requiring the
 vanishing of all bilinear expressions

 miner une multiplicite a n dimensions Mn, telle qu'en chacun des ses points toutes les tangentes a cette
 multiplicite soient situees dans la multiplicity plane correspondente a ce point'. Carton's formulation of

 the integration problem can be translated as follows. Consider the exterior ideal J, simply generated by the

 1 -forms co' , . . . , cos . To find integral submanifolds of X is equivalent to the problem of determining integral
 submanifolds of the distribution of vector fields which is dual to X. If we indicate this distribution with

 V = {i>i, . . . , vr-s }, the vector space V 'x is precisely the linear variety to which Cartan referred. Indeed, for
 a submanifold Mn to be an integral variety of V is necessary and sufficient that TMn 'x C V I* , Vx 6 Mn.

 46 Here I am referring to von Weber's remarks according to which one has to consider in the differential

 system Sv , together with equations of type dxfi£h = Y,aih also the equations obtained by them
 through differentiation.

 4/ Unless the system (36) is completely integrable.

 On the genesis of the Cartan-Kahler theory 421

 where dx and 8x are arbitrary integral linear elements belonging to Ep. Thus, Cartan
 arrived at the crucial definition of integral element of more than one dimension:

 An element consisting of linear integral elements is said to be an integral element

 of dimension 2, 3, ... if every two linear integral elements satisfy (37).48

 Then he defined two integral linear elements dx, 8x to be associated or in involution

 if all of the bilinear expressions (37) vanish. As a consequence of this, the definition

 of integral element could be rephrased as follows:

 A linear integral element of dimension 2, 3, ... is an element consisting of linear

 integral elements which are associated pairwise.49

 Once more, Cartan found it useful to emphasize his geometrical approach by observing

 that if the quantities dxiSxk -dxkSxi are regarded as Pliicker's coordinates of a straight

 line, then the bilinear relations (37) can be interpreted as defining linear complexes in

 projective spaces; in this connection, he often insisted upon the possibility of yielding

 a thorough classification of all Pfaffian systems on the basis of the classification of
 linear complexes themselves.

 It is somehow surprising that Cartan never mentioned von Weber's valuable
 researches in this field,50 in particular von Weber's frequent recourse to the theory

 of linear complexes and bilinear forms. It is true that they had been published only a

 year before the publication of Cartan's (1901a) epoch-making article, and so he might

 not have had the opportunity of studying them carefully or even of reading them at all.
 Nevertheless, it is of considerable historical interest that many ideas fully developed

 by Cartan could already be found in von Weber's work.

 We will see below that even for the crucial notion of a Pfaffian system in involution

 (closely related to Problem 2 of von Weber's theory) no mention of von Weber's anal-

 ysis was made by Cartan. Once more, it is probable that Cartan was not aware of von
 Weber's work, and that he introduced involutive systems by borrowing them directly

 from the theory of general systems of partial differential equations as developed by
 Meray, Riquier and Delassus (see below).

 48 'Appelons element integral a 2, 3, . . . dimensions un element forme d' elements lineaires integraux et
 tel, de plus, que deux quelconques d'entre eux satisfassent au system (37)'. In modern terms, Cartan's
 definition of integral element of (36) can be translated as follows: a p-dimensional integral element of (36)

 is a subspace Ep C TMr I* such that:

 (cOj-,Vi)= 0 A (da)j',Vi,V k)=0 (7 = 1,..., 5).

 49 'Un element integral a 2, 3, . . . dimensions est un element forme d'elements lineaires integraux associes
 deux a deux'.

 50 Among von Weber's works considered here, von Weber (1898a) was the only one explicitly cited by
 Cartan (1901a,b).

 7.2 Cauchy's first theorem

 What Cartan called Cauchy's first problem was the following:

 Given a /^-dimensional integral variety Mp of a system of total differentials

 equations, to determine a (p + 1) -dimensional integral variety Af^+i passing

 through Mp .51

 Its relevance can hardly be overestimated. Indeed, it turns out that the problem

 of integration of (36) can be solved by a step-by-step procedure consisting of deter-

 mining integral varieties of increasing dimensions. Clearly, a necessary condition for

 the existence of a (/? -I- l)-dimensional integral variety Mp+' passing through Mp
 is that every /^-dimensional integral element Ep of Mp is contained at least in one
 (/? + l)-dimensional integral element Ep+' . However this condition is not sufficient.
 To guarantee the existence of such integral varieties, one has to require more, i.e.,

 that at least one (p + 1) -dimensional Ep+' integral element passes through every
 /^-dimensional integral element of the space.

 Before moving on to the resolution of Cauchy's first problem, Cartan observed,

 it is useful to make a few geometrical remarks on the structure of the integral ele-

 ments Ep+' . If Ep is supposed to be generated by p linearly independent vectors, i.e.,
 Ep = {e' , ... ,ep), then an integral element Ep+' D Ep can be defined by adding
 a linear element e to Ep, which is linearly independent of Ep' clearly, one requires
 both that e is integral and that e is in involution with ei , V/ = 1, . . . , p.

 The (p + 1) -dimensional element Ep+' containing Ep depends on r - p homoge-

 neous parameters,52 and the equations which express that Ep+' is integral are linear in
 these parameters. Let us suppose that these equations reduce in number tor- p- u - 1

 (with u > 0), then at least one integral element £p+i passes through every integral
 element Ep. In particular if u = 0 then such a Ep+' is unique. In general, these
 integral elements build up an infinite family depending on u arbitrary constants. It
 may happen that in particular cases the degree of indeterminacy is greater than m;

 in this eventuality, Cartan said that Ep is a singular element, otherwise Ep was said
 to be regular.53 The notion of singularity was easily transferred to integral varieties

 by defining them to be singular when all their integral elements are singular in the
 specified sense.

 At this point Cartan was ready to solve Cauchy's first problem by proving what he

 called Cauchy's first theorem. This is a crucial point in the whole theory of exterior dif-

 ferential systems; indeed, it can be considered as the gist of what is nowadays known
 as Cartan-Kahler theorem, since one can find in it the proof of the inductive step that

 is crucial for assessing the existence of varieties that 'integrate' integral elements. As

 5 1 'Etant donnee une multiplicity integrate a p dimensions Mp d'un systeme d'equations aux differentielles

 totales, faire passer par Mp une multiplicity integrate a p + 1 dimensions Mp+' '

 52 The numbers of effective parameters is r - p - 1 ; in general, every q -dimensional element Eq containing
 a p-dimensional element Ep depends on (q - p)(r - q) effective parameters. See Goursat's (1922, §81)
 proof.

 53 A clearer explanation of Cartan's notion of regularity will be given in the next section in terms of the
 so-called characteristic integers.

 On the genesis of the Cartan-Kahler theory 423

 it is well-known, the validity of the theorem is limited to the class of analytic Pfaffian

 systems. For this reason we will suppose, as Cartan explicitly did, that the coefficients

 of (36) are analytic functions of x.

 Theorem 5 (Cauchy 's first theorem) Suppose that every p -dimensional, regular, inte-

 gral element passes through at least one ( p + ') -dimensional integral element Ep+ ';
 then , given a non-singular p-dimensional integral variety Mp of (36), a (p + 1)-
 dimensional integral variety Mp+ ' exists which passes through Mp. More precisely ;
 if oou (p + ') -dimensional integral elements passes through every regular, integral

 element Ep, then many integral varieties Mp+' exist which depend upon u arbitrary
 functions.

 In order to offer a general idea of how it works, it will be enough to limit ourselves

 to the following remarks.

 Cartan's starting point was to translate the geometrical content of the statement into an

 analytic form. To this end, he considered on M p a /7-dimensional regular integral ele-

 ment E®p that he supposed to have its centre at a fixed point P° = (jcp . . . , x J?), of Mp.

 In an appropriate open subset containing P°, Mp can be represented by r - p analytic

 functions expressing, for instance, the variables xp+' , . . . , xr in terms of x' , . . . , xp.
 Furthermore, the linear equations (with constant coefficients) defining the integral

 element E®p are solvable with respect to the differentials dxp+' , . . . , dxr. Then, if a

 (p + l)-dimensional integral element £^+1 passing through E® is considered, the
 r - p - 1 equations defining it are solvable with respect to the r - p - 1 differentials

 dxp+ 2, . . . , dxr, say. Thus, a (p + 1) -dimensional integral variety Mp+' admitting
 will be expressed, in an appropriate neighbourhood of P°, byr - p - l analytic

 functions, jcp+2, . . . , xr of x' , . . . , jc^+i .

 At this point, Cartan introduced some simplification in the notation: jcp+i was
 replaced by x and xp+i, • • • > *r by z' , . . . , zm (clearly, m = r - p - 1). As a con-
 sequence of this, the equations for Mp (in a neighbourhood of P°) can be written as
 follows:

 * = 4>(x', . . . ,xp),
 z' =4>'(x',...,xp)
 . (38)

 Zj =Zj(x,x'9...,xp+ 1), 0' = l,...,m = r - p - 1). (39)

 If x is replaced by x - </>(jci , . . . , xp) then (38) can be rewritten as

 x = 0,
 Zj =(/>j(x i, ...,*p), ( j = 1, ...,m).

 Zm = $m(x 1 » • • • > xp)i

 while the variety Mp+' can be expressed (in a neighbourhood of P°) by:

 424 A. Cogliati

 Consequently, the condition that Mp passes through Mp+' requires that:

 zj( 0,x',...,xp) =<f>j(x',...,xp) ( j = 1 , ...,m).

 Now, the problem consists of writing down the differential equations for the r - p - 1

 unknown functions that have to be satisfied for Mp+' to be an integral variety of
 (36). To this end, it is first necessary to consider the generic ( p + l)-dimensional

 element (having its centre in a neighbourhood of P°) consisting of the linear elements

 that one obtains when infinitesimal increments are attributed to every single variable

 x, x' , . . . , xp. Their direction parameters are given by the following table:

 dx_ _ dx± _ _ dx%_ _ dz±_ _ * * * _ dzm

 c ■ 1 ~~ 0 _ - _ o ~ _ foj _ - * * * - _ >

 . dx _ dx' _ _ dxp _ dQ _ _ _ dzrn

 r . dx _ dx 1 _ * * * _ dx^_ _ dz' _ ' * * _ dzm
 CP r ' 0 ~ 0 - * * * - i _ - l Jz£ _ - ' * * - _ aZm -

 Then one requires that this (p + l)-dimensional element is indeed an integral element;

 that is, one requires (i) that every linear element is integral and (ii) that the linear inte-

 gral elements are in pairwise involution. Cartan observed that it is useful to separate

 such a system of differential equations into two groups: the first one (I) assures that the

 element Ep = (e' , . . . , ep) is integral, the second one (II) that the linear element e is

 integral and in involution with Ep. It is easily seen that (I) does not contain the deriv-
 atives . . . , while the second system of equations (II) is linear with respect to
 such derivatives. At this point, the regularity assumptions come into play: essentially,

 the fact that the indeterminacy degree of Ep+' is minimal guarantees the possibility
 of rewriting the system (II) in a Cauchy-Kovalevskaya form where m - u derivatives

 are expressed in terms of an equal number of analytic functions:

 The theory of the systems of partial differential equations of this particular kind guar-
 antees the existence of holomorphic solutions in a neighbourhood of P° depending on

 u arbitrary54 functions zm-u+ 1 , • • • » zm , such that for x = 0 they reduce to , . . . , <f>m .

 Cartan's final step consisted in proving that the solution so obtained actually repre-

 sents a (p + l)-dimensional integral variety of the system (36), that is, it satisfies both
 systems (I) and (II). First, he proved that every solution of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya

 On the genesis of the Cartan-Kahler theory 425

 system satisfies systems (I) and (II) for x = 0. Then he proved that every solution

 satisfying (I) and (II) for a generic x also satisfies (I) and (II) for every infinitesimally

 close point x + 8x, showing in such a way that the theorem is true for every point
 within an appropriate neighbourhood of P°.

 As we have seen, von Weber had been the first person to set the problem of the

 integration of general Pfaffian systems in terms of the existence of integral varieties
 of increasing dimension. Yet, he was unable to provide a systematic analysis of the
 conditions whose determination was the object of Problem 2 of his theory. On his
 part, Cartan considered the determination of chains of integral varieties of increasing
 dimension as the gist of the integration procedure of general Pfaffian systems. To
 this end, he introduced the following definition of Pfaffian system in involution. A

 Pfaffian system (36) was said to be in involution if at least one 2-dimensional integral

 variety M2 passes through each integral curve M' , at least one 3-dimensional integral

 variety M3 passes through each 2-dimensional integral variety M2, etc. and, finally, at

 least one g -dimensional integral variety Mg passes through each (g - 1) -dimensional

 integral variety Mg- ' .55 Now, from Cauchy's first theorem, it follows that a necessary
 and sufficient condition for the system (36) to be in involution is that every regu-
 lar 1 -dimensional integral element E' belongs at least to one 2-dimensional integral
 element £2 , every regular 2-dimensional integral element £2 belongs at least to one
 3-dimensional integral element, etc. and, finally, every regular ( g - 1) -dimensional

 integral element Eg-' belongs at least to one g-dimensional integral element Eg. In
 this way, Cartan was able to provide a complete answer to von Weber's Problem 2

 by obtaining at the same time an answer to Problem 1 since the determination of the

 number g coincides with the determination of integral (regular) varieties of maximal
 dimension.

 Some remarks on the historical origins of the notion of involutive systems of Pfaf-

 fian equations are in order here. To my knowledge, von Weber was the first to draw
 attention on the relation between the general theory of canonical passive (involutive)

 systems of partial differential equations and the existence of chains of integral varie-

 ties of (36) of increasing dimensions. Thus, it would be natural to trace back Cartan's

 notion of involution to von Weber's works on general Pfaffian systems, namely to von

 Weber (1900a). However, I cannot produce any evidence that Cartan derived from von

 Weber the inspiration for his researches on this point. On the contrary, Cartan's (1931,

 pp. 28-29) recollections seem to support the possibility that he developed such a notion

 independently of von Weber. In fact, he recognized that his own notion of involution

 was analogous to the one introduced by Meray and Riquier, among others, in the con-

 text of the theory of general systems of partial differential equations. Finally, it seems
 that an important influence on Cartan was exerted by the work of Delassus (1896),

 namely, in which, for the first time, the study of solutions of general systems of partial
 differential equations was traced back to the study of Cauchy-Kovalevskaya sys-
 tems. In particular, Delassus had shown that the whole integration procedure could be
 reduced to successive integrations of Cauchy-Kovalevskaya systems in an increasing

 55 The number g was called by Cartan the genre of the system (36); it is defined as the maximal dimension
 of regular integral varieties of (36). In the next section, we will see how the existence of such an integer
 can be deduced from the so-called characteristic integers of (36).

 number of independent variables. From this point of view, Cartan's achievements can
 be seen as a translation and a development of Delassus' results in the geometric,

 coordinates-independent language of exterior differential forms.

 7.3 Genre and characters

 Cauchy's first theorem highlights the need to proceed toward a detailed geometrical
 analysis of the properties of integral elements. In particular, as we have just seen,

 Cartan was interested in studying the conditions guaranteeing the existence of integral
 elements of increasing dimensions. His procedure can be summarized as follows: let

 us consider a p-dimensional integral element Ep of a certain point jc; we can think of
 it as being generated by p linearly independent linear integral elements reciprocally

 in involution: Ep = (ei, . . . , ep). To construct an integral element Ep+ ' containing
 Ep , as we already know, one has to add to Ep an integral linear element e independent
 of Ep and in involution with , (i = 1, . . . , p ).56 If, as Cartan would do in Cartan
 (1901b), we introduce the linear variety57 H(EP ), the polar element 58 of Ep , of all

 integral linear elements in involution with Ep , we can rephrase the preceding sentence
 by saying that Ep+' = ( Ep , e ), with e € H(EP) and e £ Ep.

 In order to characterize the structure of such polar elements as well as to obtain

 information on the degree of indeterminacy of integral elements, Cartan introduced a

 sequence of integers, which we will indicate with fi , to be defined as follows:

 dim H(Ep) = rp+ ' + p + 1.

 Geometrically, this means that the polar element H(EP) is generated by the p base

 vectors of Ep and by rp+' -I- 1 linear integral elements, eo,ei,..., e?p+ { . As a conse-
 quence of this, the (p + l)-dimensional integral elements Ep+' passing through Ep

 depend on rp+' parameters or, as Cartan expressed himself, oor^+l integral elements

 Ep- |_i pass through Ep.

 Although Cartan was not very explicit, it is clear that the coefficients rp depend

 not only on the point x to which the Ep s belong but also on the choice of the basis
 of the tangent space at x to the integral variety (indeed, even on the ordering of such

 a basis).59 Thus, to be rigorous, he should have written rp(x; e' , . . . , ep-') instead
 of rp. In fact, it appears that the coefficients rp effectively introduced by Cartan,
 the so-called characteristic integers , should be interpreted as the minimum values of
 rp(x; e', . . . , ep-') when x varies over Mr and the e/'s (/ = 1, 1) vary over

 56 Remember that e is in involution with Ep = (e', . . . , ep) if, and only if, dco^ie, e{) - 0, (k =
 1, . . . , s; i = 1, . . . , p).

 57 The fact that H(Ep) is a linear variety is a consequence of the bilinearity of (37). It should be observed
 that, although consisting of linear integral elements, in general, H(Ep ) is not an integral element. The
 reason for this is that two linear integral elements in involution with a third are not necessarily in involution
 between themselves. See Cartan (1901a, p. 250).

 58 To my knowledge, this denomination was first introduced by Cartan when discussing Pfaffian systems
 of character one in Cartan (1901b, §18).

 TMr U:

 rp = Min{rp(x,e' , ' x € Afr, e-x eTMr U).

 This lack of notational precision was justified, in Cartan's view, by the necessity of

 focusing his analysis60 on the so-called regular integral elements , i.e., on those inte-

 gral elements for which rp = rp. More precisely, according to Cartan's definition, a
 /7-dimensional integral element Ep is regular if, and only if, rp+i = rp+ 1,61 or, in
 another words, when its polar element has minimal dimension. As a consequence of
 this, in what follows we will limit our attention to non-singular (i.e., regular) integral

 elements, as Cartan did, and for this reason we will ignore the distinction between rp

 From these preliminary remarks, Cartan moved on to demonstrate certain arithmet-

 ical relations among the characteristic integers, which turn out to be very useful for

 and rp.

 the following discussion.

 A first result is that the integers rp decrease when the index p increases. Indeed, let
 us consider a regular integral element Ep and a regular integral element Ep-' con-
 tained therein; since every linear integral element in involution with Ep is, a fortiori,
 in involution with Ep-' C Ep, we have H(Ep ) C H(Ep-' ) and thus, rp > rp+' + 1 .
 From this, it follows that the succession of integers {rp} is decreasing, and that an
 integer g exists such that rg+' = - 1 . Therefore, the polar space H(Eg) does coincide
 with Eg (supposed to be regular) and no ( g + l)-dimensional integral element Eg+'
 passes through Eg. The integer g Cartan called the genre of the differential system
 (36).

 Another chain of inequalities gives information on the differences among three

 consecutive characteristic integers:

 rP ~ rp+ 1 > rp+' - rp+2 (p < g - 2).

 As with the preceding inequality, its demonstration relies on geometric considerations

 concerning the polar spaces H(Ep- 1), H(Ep ) and H(Ep+').

 From this and from rg-' - rg - 1 > rg, Cartan eventually deduced the following

 fundamental chain of inequalities:

 r - n - ' > r' - 7*2 - 1 > • • • > rg-' - rg - 1 > rg. (42)

 The numbers occurring in such inequalities assume a great importance in the theory.

 Like the characteristic integers rp, they are invariants of the system (36) with respect

 60 As we will see below, characteristic elements are a major exception.

 61 It should be observed that this is different from the notion of regularity as given, for example, by Olver
 (1995, p. 456).

 to arbitrary changes of coordinates,62 and provide a useful tool for the classification

 of general Pfaffian systems. Cartan indicated them with s', ...,sg9 namely63:

 428 A. Cogliati

 s' = r' - r2 - 1

 . = rg-

 ; (43)
 *«-i = rg- 1

 Cartan observed that the first of these integers, s' , had already been introduced by von

 Weber under the denomination of the character of the system (36). By generalizing
 such a notion to the subsequent integers, Cartan spoke of second, third, etc. charac-
 ters, respectively. As we have seen, von Weber had introduced the character s' in a
 purely algebraic manner (except for the subsequent interpretation in terms of linear

 complexes) as the number of linearly independent relations built up with the bilinear

 covariants of the Pfaffian system. It is easy to demonstrate that Cartan's definition

 coincides with that of von Weber's. Indeed, it is sufficient to observe that, according

 to Cartan's definition, s' is the number of linearly independent equations which one
 has to add to (36) in order to obtain the polar element of a (regular) linear integral
 element E'.

 The relevance of such integers was clarified by the possibility of determining the

 most general (regular) integral variety Mg of (36) by repeated application of Cauchy's
 first theorem. More precisely, Cartan was able to yield a full characterization of the

 indeterminacy degree of the solutions of (36) by demonstrating the following

 Theorem 6 (Cauchy's second theorem) Given a Pfaffian system of s linearly inde-

 pendent equations in r variables , of genre g and with characters s', ... ,sg. Then , the
 r variables can be divided into g + 2 groups:

 Xr | 9 j • • • 9 9

 Z' » Z2 » • • • » Zs »
 70) 7(U 70)

 .(g) .(g) .(g)
 2 ' • • • » £sg •

 such that on the most general integral variety Mg the variables x' , JC2, . . . , xg can be

 regarded as independent and, in a neighbourhood of a regular point (jtp . . . , jc^), Mg

 is determined by the following initial conditions: on Mg, z'8' *2?' . . . , Zsf reduce

 to sg arbitrary functions of x' , . . . , xg; for xg = x°, the z^-1' . . . , reduce

 to sg- 1 arbitrary functions of x' , . . . , xg-'; etc.; for xg = jc®, . . . , *2 = *2 ^

 62 Such an invariance property is essentially due to the covariance of the exterior derivative. See Cartan
 (1901b, pp. 236-237).

 63 The first integer r - r' - 1 is ignored since it is easily demonstrated to be equal to 5, the number of
 linear independent Pfaffian equations of the system, s was sometimes called the 0th character of (36), for
 example, in Amaldi (1942).

 As Cartan observed, the theorem includes the results already obtained by Bier-
 mann64 in the case of unconditioned Pfaffian systems. Clearly, Cartan's achievements

 were far more general, rigorous and complete. Furthermore, the characterization of

 the indeterminacy of the integral solutions agreed with analogous results obtained by

 Delassus (1896) in his researches on general systems of partial differential equations.

 Nevertheless, Cartan claimed that his new approach through exterior differential forms

 was superior because it had the advantage of being independent of a particular choice
 of coordinates.

 7.4 Characteristic elements

 Thus far, we have dealt with regular integral elements. However, singular integral
 elements play an important role, too. Following Engel, von Weber had introduced
 characteristic transformations as those infinitesimal transformations which are dual to

 the Pfaffian equations of the system and leave the system invariant. On his part, Car-

 tan introduced what he called characteristic elements by observing that in some cases

 the differential equations of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya system determining the inte-

 gral variety Mp+' passing through a given integral variety Mp assume a particularly
 simple form which greatly simplifies their integration. By referring to the notation
 of §7.2, Cartan considered the eventuality in which such equations do not depend

 upon the derivatives |j^, (/ = 1, . . . , r - p - 1; k = 1 that is the case in
 which the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya system is independent of the linear integral elements

 e',...,ep generating the integral element Ep. As a consequence of this, the partial

 derivatives . . . , Zr^~l define a linear integral element e which depends only on
 the point considered and is in involution with all the integral elements Ep passing
 through this point. If this is the case, at every point of the space65 a linear integral

 element exists that is in involution with every linear integral element drawn from this

 point. Such linear integral elements were called characteristic by Cartan.66 Clearly, a
 linear integral characteristic element is also singular , since oori_1 integral elements

 £2 pass through it.

 As von Weber had already observed, the importance of characteristic elements67
 lay in the possibility of exploiting their existence to simplify the integration of the
 Pfaffian system under examination. Indeed, after defining the characteristic Pfaffian

 system as the system of total differential equation determining characteristic elements,

 Cartan was able to reformulate von Weber's Theorem 4 in the following way:

 64 See §3 above.

 65 Actually, we should limit ourselves to some open subset of the space.

 66 The denomination stemmed from the theory of partial differential equations, namely from the theory of
 Cauchy's characteristics. The connection between Cartan's characteristic elements and Cauchy's charac-
 teristics is explained very clearly in Amaldi (1942, pp. 180-182).

 67 As Engel had done, he actually spoke of transformations leaving the Pfaffian system invariant.

 Theorem 7 The minimal number of variables upon which , by means of a change of

 variables , the coefficients and the differentials of a given Pfaffian system can depend

 is equal to the number of linear independent equations of the characteristic system;

 these variables are given by the integration of such a system.

 As for von Weber's analysis, a crucial point in Cartan's treatment was the fact that

 the characteristic system is completely integrable. However, whereas von Weber had

 established such a property by having recourse to what we called characteristic trans-
 formations, and by relying upon Clebsch's theorem on complete systems of linear
 partial differential equations, Cartan deliberately avoided such expedients and man-

 aged to demonstrate the complete integrability of the characteristic system using dif-

 ferential forms only. Within a few months, he was able to offer two different proofs.

 The first one (Cartan 1901a, pp. 302-305) consisted of a step-by-step procedure which
 relied on the basic property according to which a Pfaffian system of r - 1 equations

 in r variables is necessarily completely integrable. The second one (Cartan 1901b, pp.

 248-249) was presented instead as a more direct application of the symbolic calculus

 with exterior differential forms that he himself had developed in Cartan (1899).

 It should be noticed that Cartan's refusal to utilize infinitesimal transformations

 was by no means casual. I suggest that his need to avoid any recourse to them was due

 to the project of developing an approach to continuous 'Lie groups' purely in terms of

 Pfaffian forms without any use of infinitesimal transformations, which in his view68

 did not represent an appropriate technical tool for dealing with the structural theory

 of infinite dimensional continuous groups of transformations.

 7.5 Pfaffian systems of character one, II

 The present paragraph is devoted to a discussion of Cartan's analysis of this special

 type of Pfaffian systems as given in Cartan (1901b) with the aim of drawing a compar-
 ison between von Weber's and Cartan's approaches. Whereas von Weber's treatment
 was almost entirely based on analytical and algebraic considerations, Cartan carried

 out his analysis in geometrical terms, relying heavily on the new properties of his exte-
 rior differential calculus, as he had done in his approach to characteristic elements.
 At the beginning of his discussion, Cartan stated that his analysis of Pfaffian systems
 of character one did not lead to any new results with respect to von Weber's (1898a)

 paper. Nevertheless, he set out to reinterpret von Weber's achievements in order to
 yield a concrete application of the principles of his theory.

 Let us begin with Cartan's deduction of the so-called derived system of (36).

 Contrary to von Weber's analysis, which had recourse to infinitesimal transforma-
 tions (indeed, the dual counterpart of differential expressions) to deduce via Theo-
 rem 3 the existence of the system (23) invariantly connected to the Pfaffian system
 under examination, Cartan first defined the notion of congruence between two dif-
 ferential forms,69 and then he introduced the derived system in the following way.

 68 See, for instance, Cartan (1904, Chap. 2).

 69 If S2 and n designate two differential forms with the same degree, and <d' , . . . , (op designate p homo-
 geneous differential forms with degree less or, at most, equal to that of Q (and FI), then Cartan defined

 He considered a Pfaffian system of s independent equations, &>/ = 0, (i = 1, . . . , s),

 in r variables and he introduced r - s Pfaffian forms cbj , (j = 1 , . . . , r - s) such that

 {a>i,cbj} ( i = 1, . . . , s' j = 1, . . . , r - s) are n independent Pfaffian forms.70 As a
 consequence of this, the s bilinear covariants of the system can be written as

 0)'i = ^ Aijkibj A a>k = S2i, (modtwi ,(02,..., cos), (i = 1

 n-s

 j.k= l

 Now, in general, the differential forms £2, are not independent; if, for example71 :

 l' £2] + /2^2 *h * * * + =0,

 then one has:

 (l'Q)' + 12(02 +

 In such a way, Cartan demonstrated that appropriate linear combinations of the Pfaf-

 fian equations of the system (36) exist such that every couple of integral elements
 of (36) is in involution with respect to them. He then considered all the equations of

 type l'0)' + I2C02 +

 of (36). It is clear that Cartan's definition was a generalization of von Weber's, which

 was limited to systems of character one. Furthermore, it is worth emphasizing that

 the introduction of derived systems was brought about by Cartan purely in terms of

 exterior differential forms without any recourse to operations with vector fields (infin-
 itesimal transformations, in his wording). To this end, an important role may have

 been played by the remark, already implicit in Engel's and von Weber's work, that
 exterior differentiation could be considered in a certain sense as the dual counterpart

 of the Lie-bracketing operation between two infinitesimal transformations.72

 Specializing his discussion to systems of character one, in accordance with von
 Weber's results Cartan was able to show that in this case the derived system of (36)

 consists of the s - 1 equations:

 COi - li(D' =0 (1 = 2, . . . , s).

 and, consequently, that the Eq. 36 could be chosen in such a way that:

 a>2 = &>3 = • • • = co's = 0 (mod co' , . . . , &>5).

 432 A. Cogliati

 Before turning to a detailed study of the derived system and exploiting its properties

 to integrate the Pfaffian system under examination, it is necessary, Cartan observed, to

 examine carefully the geometric properties of the (unique) linear complex associated

 to (36). The first problem to be solved is the determination of the maximal dimension
 of (regular) integral elements and consequently the maximal dimension of (regular)

 integral varieties. In the light of von Weber's results, one may expect that characteristic

 elements play a role of strategic importance and, indeed, it turns out that this is the

 case also for Cartan's treatment of the subject.

 Cartan started by considering the linear variety of all linear integral elements of

 (36); he indicated it with Hp , where p = r -s designates its dimension. He supposed
 that o is the dimension of the greatest characteristic element ea and then considered a

 linear integral element E ' £ €a ; since E i is supposed to be regular and the character of

 (36) is assumed to be equal to 1 , its polar element Hp- j is a linear variety of dimension
 p - 1. Now, Cartan observed with respect to the linear integral elements of Hp-' a
 characteristic element €a+' of dimension a + 1 exists such that €a+ 1 = (€a , E' ).73 It

 turns out, as Cartan demonstrated in full detail, that €a+' is the greatest characteristic

 element with respect to Hp-' . At this point, he considered another linear integral ele-

 ment E[ not belonging to €a+' ; thus, the linear elements of Hp-' in involution with
 E[ generate a linear variety Hp- 2 whose greatest characteristic element €a+2 can be

 described as the linear variety (€a , E' , E[ ). Iterating the same process an appropriate
 number of times, one finally arrives at a (necessarily integral) element74 Hp-V which
 coincides with its characteristic element €a+v. The number v is obtained by equating

 the dimension of Hr-V with that of €a+v; thus:

 p - cr = 2v.

 Consequently, since Hp-V is one of the integral elements of (36) of maximal dimen-
 sion, the genre of the Pfaffian system is p - v.75 Now, from the previous geometrical

 construction of maximal integral elements it follows that the bilinear covariant co'
 must be expressed in terms of 2v independent Pfaffian forms, so that:

 a)' = a)' A <yv+ 1 H

 This formula is the starting point for the subsequent analytical study of integral vari-

 eties of systems of character one.

 To emphasize the novelty of Cartan's technical tools with respect to those utilized

 by von Weber, let us consider his proof of the theorem according to which if v > 1 then

 the derived system of (36) is completely integrable. Cartan supposed that the Pfaffian

 forms of (36) are chosen in such a way that its derived system can be written as:

 7^ The fact that €a+' is characteristic with respect to //p_i means that e € €a+' if, and only if, (Oi(e) =
 0 (1 = 1 and o)' ( e , ef) =0Ve' e Hp-' . The statement that (€a , E' ) is characteristic with respect
 to Hp- 1 should now be clear if one recalls the definition of polar element.

 74 Cartan indicated with h what here is indicated with v. The change in notation is aimed at facilitating the
 comparison with von Weber (1898a).

 75 This is in accordance with von Weber's normal form (24) for the case in which v > 1 .

 From Cartan's definition of derived system, it follows that:

 co'2 = (o'l = • • • = Q)'s = 0 (mod co' , . . . , cos). (47)

 As a consequence of o)f2 = 0 (mod<wi , . . . , cos) one has:

 ing the derivative of the last congruence above, one obtains

 and, consequently, co' A x = 0, (mod o)', . . . , o)s). This is equivalent to:

 O) ' = X A 7T + (Wl A 7Tl H

 for appropriate forms 7r, 7Ti , . . . , tts of degree one. Now, unless x = 0 (mod o)' ),
 the integral elements of (36) that satisfy x = 0 and n = 0 would be characteris-
 tic elements, and consequently the number of equations of the characteristic system
 would be s + 2. However, in such an eventuality, we would have v = 1 which contra-

 dicts the hypothesis of the theorem to be proved. Thus, the only possibility left is that
 X = 0 (mod o)'). As result of this, from (48) we obtain: o)'2 = 0 (mod a>2 , ,o)s)
 and, after repeating the same reasoning for 0)3, . . . , o)s, we eventually deduce that

 0)2 = o)'2 = • • • = o)fs = 0 (mod 0)2 , . . . , o)s),

 which, according to Cartan's reformulation of Frobenius' theorem,77 implies the com-

 plete integrability of the derived system of (36).

 8 Concluding remarks

 Contrary to prevalent opinion, far from being the achievement of an isolated mathe-

 matical genius Cartan's theory of exterior differential systems (later on generalized by
 Kahler (1934) to differential systems of any degree) was deeply rooted in the historical

 context of the late nineteenth century theory of partial differential equations. Indeed,
 as we have seen, his achievements were placed at the intersection of two closely
 related strands of research: the theory of not completely integrable systems of Pfaffian

 equations as developed by Engel and von Weber, and the theory of general systems of

 76 This is due to the fact that, according to (46), the characteristic element of maximal dimension is indi-
 viduated by: d>j = 0 (i = 1, . . . , 2v).

 partial differential equations that was the main focus of attention of Meray, Riquier and

 Delassus among others. Cartan's great merit was to reinterpret them systematically
 in a new and powerful geometrical language whose central core was represented by

 his exterior differential calculus. At the same time, the very emphasis placed by him

 on the language of exterior differential forms may be indicated as the main cause for

 the undeserved lack of attention that for some years characterized the response of the

 mathematical community towards his achievements in this field. In this connection, it

 is interesting to remark that still in 1924 Vessiot, while praising the beauty of Cartan's

 integration theory, felt the necessity to translate it into its dual counterpart by replacing

 exterior Pfaffian forms with the notion of faisceau of infinitesimal transformations.

 As Kahler suggested in the introduction to his masterpiece (Kahler 1934) in a really

 effective and historically accurate way, such a double historical origin was reflected

 in the twofold virtue of the theory: on one hand, with its emphasis on exterior forms

 it provided Cartan with the necessary tools for subsequent applications to geometry
 (namely, the method of moving frames) as well as to the theory of infinite contin-

 uous Lie groups. On the other hand, it offered a deeper insight into the machinery

 ( Mechanik ) of partial differential equations.
