 The snare of simplicity: the Newton-Flamsteed
 correspondence revisited

 Abstract The correspondence in 1680 and 1681 between John Flamsteed and Isaac

 Newton on Flamsteed's theory of the comet of 1680 tells half the story. Related man
 uscripts reveal Newton was pursuing his own comprehensive line of inquiry based
 on principles that were the antithesis of Flamsteed's procedures. Following generally
 accepted views in England, Newton's work was marked by critical evaluation of data

 but marred by uncritical use of simple calculating techniques based on what might be

 termed Platonic archetypes of straightness. Flamsteed's intervention provided useful
 data and allowed Newton to seek additional information. Although Newton suppos
 edly briefly considered a solution that vaguely resembled his parabolic approximation

 of the path of the comet determined 5 years later, the evidence Newton provided (based

 on simple hypotheses) did not support such a highly curved path or one in which the
 sun apart from the solar vortex exerted influence. Newton's work, including an alleged

 harmonic law of tails, was quietly abandoned in favor of other work. With new insight,
 Newton revived work on comets as fully gravitational objects immediately following
 Halley's visit in 1684. This little known side of the episode provides a fresh oppor
 tunity to examine Newton's sources and actual practice in developing a new line of
 inquiry. An appendix dating sections of Newton's Waste Book entries on comets is
 included.

 1 Introduction

 The capstone of the Principia (1686) was Isaac Newton's demonstration that the
 comet of 1680 was subject to the same laws of gravitational motion as the planets.
 Free of perturbations, the path of a comet, like that of a planet, would be an ellipse
 (Ruffner 2010). A parabolic path provided an approximate solution for the visible
 section near the sun. The small scale diagram of the parabola in modern editions is
 misleading. The importance Newton placed on the solution was illustrated by a two
 page fold-out diagram, the only large scale drawing in the Principia. The situation
 was entirely different during the actual appearances of the comet in 1680 and 1681.
 Newton had initiated a comprehensive study of comets predicated on a concept of
 straightness represented by the straight lines of Euclidean geometry and the great
 circles of celestial spherical trigonometry when Flamsteed intervened with a series

 of letters offering a completely different pattern of analysis. Some analysts, as shown
 in Sect. 16, see seeds of later work in Newton's suppressed responses to Flamsteed's
 ideas. Newton's efforts in 1681, however, are better understood as backward rather

 than forward looking. Newton abandoned the project, in part from the lack of accurate

 data and in part from the press of other interests.

 2 Prelude to the Comet of 1680

 Studies beginning with the Comet of 1577 negated the prevailing view of Aristotle

 that comets must be sub-lunar bodies without necessarily reviving the view of the
 Chaldeans and other ancients that comets are a kind of planet (Hellman 1944). The
 work of Tycho Brahe, Michael Maestlin, Horatio Grassi and others placing comets in
 the planetary realm did not settle the matter of a comet's path (Westman 2011). These
 early studies also engendered debates over the astrological significance of comets
 which were of little interest in English philosophical circles of Newton's day beyond

 the possibility of direct physical influence (Schechner 1997). Accordingly, this paper
 focuses on principles related to a comet's motion both apparent and real and associated
 issues about accuracy of the data.

 The observed or apparent course of a comet is merely the projection onto the celestial

 sphere of its true path of whatever shape and distance from the earth (Heidarzadeh

 2008). The idea that a comet appears to follow a great circle arc dates at least as far back

 as the comet of 1472 at a time when they were believed to be sub-lunar phenomena
 (Jervis 1985, pp. 114-119, 195-196). In 1588, Tycho found exquisite confirmation

 using different pairs of observations from the comet of 1577 that showed virtually
 identical positions of the ascending node (Brahe 1648, bk. 2, pp. 47,55). Snell (1619,
 p. 19) adhered to the idea so strongly; he evidently believed that the calculation for a
 single pair of observations for the great comet of 1618 was sufficient to demonstrate

 apparent great circle motion. Further in the same volume (Snell 1619, p. 85)Christoph

 Rothmann using procedures similar to Tycho's showed that the inclination or obliquity
 at the ecliptic of the apparent path of the comet of 1585 varied a little more than 1°

 for different pairs of observations. Other examples revealing slight deviations from

 great circles were cited from time to time leading Flamsteed to suggest, in a May

 1681 lecture, that the consensus had been that comets "moved nearly in the Arch of a
 great Circle" (Forbes 1975, p. 105). By way of correction, Flamsteed's investigations
 of the comet of 1680 showed variations in obliquity of more than 6° for different
 pairs of observations in December and January which he attributed to an increase of

 distance from the earth (Forbes 1975, p. 110). Ironically, if Snell had moved beyond
 the single calculation, he would have found similarly large deviations for the comet
 of 1618. Oblivious to Flamsteed's work, Newton also understood deviations to be an

 indication of distance but evidently thought the deviations were quite small.

 As shown by Ruffner (1971), opinions about the true motion of comets divided
 sharply between those following Tycho (1648, bk. 2, pp. 98-99), who thought that
 their short lived path must be an imperfect arc of a circular or (later) an ellipti
 cal path mimicking the planets; those following Kepler (1619, pp. 3, 93-94), who
 thought that comets being ephemeral bodies must move in rectilinear paths amongst
 the planets; and those following Kepler (1983, part 3, arts. 119, 126-129), who con
 tended that comets were dead stars that wander according to no known principle
 from vortex to vortex near their outer edges, well beyond the orbit of Saturn in the
 case of the solar vortex. Gassendi (1658, 1, p. 27) preferred to think of comets as
 everlasting bodies moving with uniform rectilinear motion through boundless space
 that begins nowhere and ends nowhere. Harking back to the ancients, Ward (1653,
 p. 21 et seq.) dismissed Descartes' idea with a passing mention going on to strongly
 oppose the views of Kepler and Gassendi. As aptly summarized by Plot (1677,
 p. 225),

 [Ward] who rather embracing the opinions of Diogenes, Apollonius Myndius,
 of the Chaldeans, and at length Seneca·, That Comets are perpetual stars and
 carryed about in a continued motion; than of Kepler, who thought of them
 still produced de novo, quickly perishing again; or of Gassendus, who held

 indeed they might be corpora aeterna, but yet that they always moved in straight
 lines;

 [Ward] proposed this new theory of them, viz. that it is much more probable
 they might be carried round in Circles or Ellipses ... so great that the Comets
 are never visible to us, but when they come to the Perige's of those Circles or
 Ellipses, ... these vast Orbs, which by reason by of standing in an oblique, or
 perpendicular posture to the eye, he demonstrated might well seem to carry them

 in straight lines

 Rather than travelling in orbits and merely seeming to be carried in straight lines, as

 Ward put it, the more generally accepted view of comets in mid-seventeenth century
 English philosophical circles was summarized by Streete (1661, p. 11),

 Comets do always appear unto us much nearer [than the Fixt-Stars], and amongst

 the Orbs of the Planets, they are generated of Planetary substance, but incompact
 and dissolvable, Illuminated (as the Planets) by the Sun, and according to the

 general consent of observations, their motions are (as Kepler defines them) in or

 near to right lines.

 About the same year as Streete's book, perhaps in response to the comet of 1661,

 Christopher Wren, then Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, devised a scheme

 to determine the distance of a comet assuming it moved in a straight line with uniform

 speed and challenged Robert Hooke, John Wallis, and others to do the same.1 Put to

 the test with the comet of 1664, Horrox (1678, p. 42) found the path to be somewhat
 curved but indicated nevertheless that the Wren method "did very near solve all the

 appearances preceding and subsequent." Unknown in England at the time, Huygens
 (1888-1950, 5, pp. 230, 266, 361, 388) berated Kepler for maintaining strict straight
 line motion but found the idea worked well for the comet of 1664 except near the

 end of visibility. Huygens found that straight lines worked less well for the comet of
 1665 but for Huygens as well as Hooke, the general approach was to assume uniform

 straight line motion and adjust the path by adding slight curvature or speed changes to
 fit further observations. Flamsteed (1995-2002, 1, p. 552), on the other hand, noting

 similarities in the apparent paths, proposed an orbital period of about 12 years for the
 comets of 1665 and 1677.

 iNewton s earnest views on comets are not documented, wiae reacting as a siuaent

 touched only incidentally the full range of opinions about comets since antiquity. The

 appearance of the comet of 1664 lit Newton's interest sufficiently to make observa

 tions, the background reading for which, starting with Streete, the Snell/Rothmann
 volume, and Wing (1651), served as Newton's introduction to practical astronomy
 (McGuire and Martin Tamny 1983, p. 300). Newton's student essays and notes enti
 tled Quaestiones quaedam philosophiae (Certain philosophical questions) included
 his observations of the comets of 1664 and 1665 and queries doubting Descartes'
 optical theory of tails and Descartes' idea that comets when in the solar vortex ride
 near its outer edge (CUL MS Add. 3996, ff. 93, 114-116). Newton's reading notes
 (CUL MS Add. 3958(B) 1, ff. 9-13) included items from Thomas Sprat's History of
 the Royal Society ( 1667) and issues of the Philosophical Transactions between March
 1664/1665 and April 1667 which treated most notably the dispute between Adrien
 Auzout and Johannes Hevelius over the accuracy of Hevelius' final observation of the

 comet of 1664. Newton offered no theories of his own during this period. As a stu

 dent, as later, Newton was interested in data offered by others rather than their ideas.
 Nevertheless, Newton's treatment of comet data was consistent with Streete's view.

 3 Two key mathematical techniques

 About 1677, perhaps in association with the comet that appeared in April, Newton
 (1967-1981,5, pp. 210-213) posed a problem: "To determine the position of a comet

 proceeding uniformly in a straight line ... from three observations of its course."2 This

 1 According to Wallis, Wren issued the challenge in 1661 or 1662 (Horrox 1678, appendix, p. 1). The
 manuscript of Wallis' derivation which I have not seen (Bodleian Library Oxford MS Don. D. 45, ff. 283v
 280r (reversed) carries the title "Problema. Di Christophori Wren, milii propositus J. K. Joh. o.A° 1665,"
 the first part of which translates, "Problem, proposed to me by Dr. Christopher Wren." D. T. Whiteside
 conjectured long ago in a personal communication that the rest of the title probably refers to "Pridie

 kalendarum Jitnii Anno 1665" or "the day before the first day of June, 1665," which might refer to the actual

 date of the Wren's challenge but more likely to the date of the manuscript. Wallis' derivation is in Horrox
 (1678, appendix, pp. 1-9). Wren's solution is in Hooke (Horrox 1678, pp. 41^2, table 5, figure 19).

 method, listed as Problem 16 in what Newton purported to be the ninth of ten Lucasian

 lectures for the academic year beginning October 1676, assumed a stationary observer
 and tracked the apparent motion of a comet across the celestial sphere. The method
 does treat an actual path as Whiteside thought (Newton 1967-1981, 5, pp. 211-212,
 n. 251). The main function of this three point method seems to have been Newton's

 earliest method for interpolating comet observations before adopting the method of
 differences.

 The Wren/Wallis method for calculating an actual rectilinear path was adapted by

 Newton sometime between 1678 and 1680 and became the basis for what Newton

 alleged to be the second of eight Lucasian lectures in 1680-1681, listed as Problem
 52 (Newton 1967-1981, 5, pp. 299-303): "From four observed positions of a comet
 crossing the sky with a uniform rectilinear motion, to gather its distance from the
 Earth, and its motion and fixed direction, supposing the Copernican hypothesis."3 A

 preliminary title without proof, "On finding the distance of a comet in the Copernican
 system,"4 was included with a full treatment of an equant (CUL MS Add. 3963.1 f.
 lv). Whiteside (1964, p. 127, n. 37) believes the simultaneous interest in an equant
 predated Newton's correspondence with Hooke in December 1679 but solutions to
 mathematical problems were always of interest to Newton. Whatever the actual dates
 and circumstances of these mathematical exercises, documents that can be dated with

 reasonable confidence between January 1680/1681 and April 1681 indicate Newton
 was building a comprehensive research program on comets using the techniques of
 Problems 16 and 52, and related Platonic ideals of straightness.

 4 The Comet of 1680 and Newton's revived interest

 Foul weather at Cambridge, London, Paris and much of northwestern Europe obscured
 the comet of 1680 on all but a few days in November.5 Few people throughout the
 region were able to see it let alone make measurements. In time, reports trickled in
 from the south of France, Italy, and Germany where conditions were better. Newton
 was probably tending his 'chymical' furnace and may have been totally oblivious
 to the comet. If Newton actually lectured on the Wren/Wallis method during the fall

 term of 1680, it was an abstract problem unrelated to the real world phenomena. When

 making inquiries later about what others observed in November, Newton had nothing

 of his own to add. But having spotted the tail on December 12, or more likely based oo

 those who had seen it, Newton's long standing interest in comets began to be revived
 (Schaffer 1987).

 motusque determinationem, in Hypothesi Copernicanaea colligere.

 4 De invention distantiae Comeue in Systemate Copernicaea.

 5 Hooke (in London) managed without instruments to obtain reasonable fixes of the comet's position
 on 2days in November which were briefly discussed at the Royal Society (Birch 1756-1757, 4, pp.
 57-58). Hooke's observations from late December to early February gathered details of the comet's physical

 appearances rather than its motion. Hooke presented this information in a lecture at the Royal Society in
 fall 1682 (Hooke 1705, pp. 150-159).

 On December 15, the next clear night, Newton viewed the comet casually in com

 pany with two colleagues, a Mr. Bainbridge and John Ellis. Making no notes at the time,

 they later recalled the tail stuck up like an outstretched finger which they reckoned to
 be about 41° long. The head although nearly obscured by moon light appeared as a
 small star with the aid of a lens or small telescope but no position measurements were

 obtained (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 366).6 This appearance undoubtedly sparked dis
 cussions among the few Fellows and Scholars who had witnessed the November event.

 The next 2 weeks may have offered two or three opportunities to view the comet

 but Newton indicated he had not minded it then. He was busy preparing a critique
 of Thomas Burnet's Telluris Theoria Sacra (Sacred Theory of the Earth) in which
 Newton notably invoked mechanical properties of the solar vortex.7 Newton also
 would have received a letter (the first ever) from Flamsteed dated 15 December 1680

 sent by way of James Crompton in which Flamsteed boasted this "December" comet
 was the same comet that appeared in November, just as he had predicted.8 Flamsteed
 included brief descriptions of the comet's tail and a hastily reduced position of the

 head on December 12. It is not known if Flamsteed's letter had any immediate effect on

 Newton—it would have been received at the peak of involvement with issues raised by

 Burnet. By December 29, however, Newton had become fully engaged in observations

 of the comet, recording arc distances from reference stars and making far more detailed
 notes of the tail than he had done in 1664.

 Newton's observations extended from December 29, 1680 to March 9, 1680/1681

 using a variety of techniques. A full examination of Newton's sources, practices, and
 results requires a separate study but some quick points can be noted. McGuire and
 Tamny ( 1983, p. 300) indicate Newton's descriptions of stars in his comet observations
 of 1664 and 1665 were stock phrases from Tycho's catalogue of stars as translated by
 Wing (1651). It also should be noted, these phrases, largely the same since the time

 of Ptolemy, mean little without corresponding depictions of the mythological images
 on a globe or star chart.9 Based on Newton's description of stars in the constellation
 Cetus, he was not using the charts in Bayer ( 1603)Bayer's Uranometria ( 1603).10 The

 6 While conditions also prevented Flamsteed from making measurements in relation to reference stars, he
 judged the tail to be 50° long (Flamsteed 1995-2002, 1, p. 747).

 7 Newton's initial response of Burnet's theory, now lost, was dated 24 December 1680. A relevant fragment
 concerning the vortex was subsequently quoted by Burnet (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 322).

 8 Flamsteed (at Greenwich) did not see the comet in November but based on reports he predicted the return

 of the comet in the evening after passing the sun. When the tail appeared in early December 1680 Flamsteed

 launched a systematic series of observations continuing into early February. As fast as he could make
 them, Flamsteed sent hastily reduced observations to various correspondents. Flamsteed routed a letter to
 Newton because he had been impressed by the telescope Newton sent to the Royal Society and assumed
 Newton would be interested. A few months later Flamsteed referred to Newton as the learned Professor

 of Astronomy at Cambridge (Forbes 1975, p. 113). For other recipients see Flamsteed (1995-2002, l.pp.
 747-763, 780-784).

 9 See Buchwald and Feingold (2013, pp 252-257) who also discuss the similar problems that Newton
 faced in the early 1700s when dealing with positions of the Colures in the constellations as described by
 Hipparchus.

 10 According to Harrison (1978) Newton owned an edition of Uranometriu published without the guide in
 1655 and a separate Explicatif) published in 1640. Acquisition dates are not known. The unified edition is

 available on the Internet at lindahall/bayer.

 use of an unidentified (and little noticed) celestial globe in describing the position of
 the second comet on April 1,1665 as "being in or very neare ye Tropick wth longitude
 IP 4d or thereabouts by the Globe" (CUL MS Add. 3996, f. 116v) suggests it also
 was Newton's key to identifying the stars.11 Tycho's catalog would have been used

 for making reductions of the raw observations and providing the stock phrases for the
 write-up, but Newton also included private notation as he would continue to do later.

 Newton had not been involved with practical astronomy for 10 or 15 years when
 interest was revived by the comet of 1680.12 He still would have needed a pictorial
 guide to identify all but a few major stars. Newton's star descriptions (CUL MS Add.

 3965.14, ff. 614r-613r) for observations in December and January were his own and not

 the stock phrases in Tycho's catalog, except incidentally, such as Andromeda's head
 (a And) or Andromeda's right knee (φ And). The constellation Triangulus universally
 depicted as a simple triangle was traditionally described in terms of the apex and
 base whereas Newton described it in relation to the angles. Newton also identified
 a sixth magnitude star in Triangulus not found in any known prior source, making
 several cross references from it to the comet and the other stars. Newton termed

 this new star the 1st star and relabeled the two southern stars in the east angle the

 second and third stars according to their increasing longitude.13 Newton's left/right

 description of the more typical mythological images rule out the use of Bayer's atlas.
 The mythological images on a star chart face the earth, while the images on a globe,
 with a few exceptions such as Andromeda, face outward reversing the left and right

 sides. Newton's descriptions of mythological figures were common sense readings of

 the outward facing images a celestial globe. Tycho's left leg of Pegasus [/c Peg] became

 Newton's "more northern star in the left foot of Pegasus," Tycho's star in the girdle
 of Cassiopeia [η Cas] became Newton's "middle star in the belly" (f. 614r),14 and so
 forth. A close examination of the artistic details in the images on various globes might

 serve to establish the maker or at least eliminate certain ones. Mercator's globe (1551)

 can be ruled out by the lack of a depiction for a sixth magnitude star in the north fish,

 '1 Buchwald and Feingold (2013, pp. 36-42) provide a detailed account of technical issues concerning
 Newton's observation of the comet of 1664 but fail to note Newton's use of a globe in this observation of the

 comet of 1665. Hall (1992, p. 91) notes that the duties of the Professor of Mathematics included instructing
 students in the use of globes and other mathematical instruments.

 12 For Newton's possible interest in astronomy around 1671 see CUL MS Add. 3985B, ff. 38r-40r, "Table
 of ye fixed Starrs for ye yeare 1671 of ye three first magnitudes." The table is in Newton's hand and includes

 about 225 first three magnitude stars, plus about fifty 4th magnitude stars, one 5th magnitude star and several

 "nebula." The coordinates most likely are from Tycho's catalog in Wing (1669) with 60' longitude added for

 precession. It has slight differences from Kepler (1627) which may not matter in this case. Corresponding

 equatorial coordinates are added. Newton's descriptors are in English, freely translated in brief from Tycho's

 Latin. Wing (1651) was not likely Newton's source because it has many significant typographical errors

 and the English translations do not match Newton's descriptions. The purpose is not known. Around the
 same time Newton admitted he would have paid more attention to a dull star-like object if it had displayed
 a tail (Philosophical Transactions #81, 1672, pp. 4017^4018). See also Buchwald and Feingold (2013, pp.
 271-272) who discuss the discrepancy in the precession allowed for the year 1671 but think the document

 might have been written later.

 13 The star probably was a 6th magnitude star designated eta Triangulus by Hevelius ( 1690) and zeta Trian
 gulus by Flamsteed (1712). Newton's distances were none too accurate when compared with corresponding
 values calculated from the coordinates of Hevelius or Flamsteed.

 ore Pisces [σ Psc], used for Newton's crucial observation of January 11. Moreover,

 Newton noted a faint tail extended on January 11 up to the "small star in the left side of

 Perseus next to the girdle (or sword belt) where it ended"15 suggesting he was guided
 by a pictorial representation of a clothed figure rather than Mercator's naked figure.

 Tycho designated the star the left elbow of Perseus [κ Per]. The Dutch globe maker

 Willem Blaeu or Blaue using Tycho's coordinates depicted it as a fourth magnitude star

 where the elbow touches the left side of Perseus at waist level atop a skirt. According

 to Buchwald and Feingold (2013, p. 332), Blaeu's globe had dominated the market for
 decades until John Senex introduced globes around 1707 based in part on Newton's
 work. Other globes, however, would need to be examined before drawing conclusions
 about the globe Newton was using in the 1680s. For example, another Dutch globe
 maker Petrus Plancius also using Tycho's coordinates depicted what seems to be a
 more distinct belt or girdle consistent with Newton's description. Other possibilities
 include those made by the London globe maker Joseph Moxon, who learned the craft
 in Holland in the 1650s, and London rivals such as Robert Morden, William Berry,
 and Philip Lea(Wallis 1978, pp. 4, 12).16 As the work progressed, Newton also began
 to rely on Bayer's atlas.

 Whichever sources Newton used tor identifying stars and plotting the approximate

 course of a comet, it seems reasonable to suppose for purposes of reduction Newton

 would have wanted the precise coordinates from Tycho's tables rather than protractions
 from a globe or map.17 In which the case the question arises why Newton did not
 revise his descriptions to agree with those of Tycho as he seems to have done in 1664?
 Newton's accounts almost certainly were written up from more basic observation
 notes after consultation with Tycho's tables. In the one instance that Newton provided

 15 Stella exiquam in latere sinisrtro persei juxto cingulum ubi desinebat.

 16 Reproductions of individual images from Mercator's globe are available at lib.harvard.edu. Gores for
 Blaeu's globe are at the Bodleian Library. Oxford and for Plancius' globe at BNF, Paris. I have seen only
 small scale reproductions of one half of Blaeu's gores in Whitfield (1995, p. 84) and the full set of Plancius'
 gores in Lachièze-Rey and Luminet (2001, p. 96). I have not seen images from Joseph Moxon's celestial
 globes or those of his London rivals, but they undoubtedly displayed some variations in the depictions.
 A case in point is the celestial map by J. Moxon (Cosgrave 2001, p. 155) which included several images
 significantly different from those depicted by Mercator, Blaeu or Plancius and which also shows various

 points of agreement with Newton's descriptions of Aries and Cassiopeia but disagreements with Newton's
 descriptions in Perseus and Pisces. Cosgrave (2001) attributes the Moxon map to Joseph dated variously
 as 1654 (pp. 154-155) and 1674 (p. 196) but the dedication to John, the Archbishop of Canterbury on
 Cosgrove's reproduction of the map indicates otherwise. John Tuttle was Archbishop from May 1691 to
 November 1694. Joseph Moxon died in February 1691. The map was printed by his son, James Moxon. In
 any case, the connection between the iconography of the globe and the map needs to be established.

 17 An important exception to the use of Tycho's coordinates occurred with Newton's observation of Decem

 ber 29. Newton referred to a star in Andromeda, annulum in termina catenae (the ring at the end of the chain).

 Based on Newton's determination of the arc-distance from Andromeda's head, the star was not Tycho's star
 in Andromeda with a similar name. Quae in extremo catenae annula (the outermost ring of the chain), but
 rather Bayer omicron Andromeda, In Cathenae annula, nonnullus 1res in dextra manu antecedens (the star

 in the ring of the chain preceding the three stars in the right hand). The latter star was catalogued by Ptolemy
 (1998, p. 380) without mention of a chain. According to Whitfield (1995, pp. 68-69) images of Andromeda

 including the chain became commonplace following the Vienna Manuscript c. 1440, the earliest surviving
 star map of the northern hemisphere. Mercator used Ptolemy's coordinates adjusted to 1551. Blaeu and

 Plancius, who usually adopted Tycho's coordinates, used Ptolemy's coordinates adjusted to 1601.

 unambiguous coordinates for a star he used Tycho's values adjusted for 68' increase
 in longitude (CUL MS Add. 4004, f. 99r).

 Newton followed the comet by naked eye until the end of January using a high
 quality monocle lens to make it distinct (CUL MS Add. 4004, f. lOlr; Westfall 1980,
 p. 392). The earliest observations in the one extant set of calculations (CUL MS Add.
 965.11, f. 153) were based on equated (mean solar) time recorded on the hour, half
 hour, or quarter hour.18 Experienced observers such as Flamsteed and Hevelius made
 repeated observations using apparent (true solar) time at whatever hour and minute
 conditions dictated. The only instrument Newton mentioned for the observations in

 December and January was a high powered three foot "perspective" to determine the

 arc distances between the head and nearby reference stars by comparing the separation
 to the full field of vision of the instrument (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 366).19 This
 technique would serve as the basis for Newton's observations of the diameter of the
 comet's head on January 8 and its position on January 8, 11, 23, and 24. Newton's

 more general technique found alignments of the comet with one or two pairs of stars,

 sometimes including a phantom point midway between them, with the comet's distance

 from one of the alignment points estimated to be equal to or a simple fraction of the

 distance between two nearby stars. Little more than summaries of the alignments and

 arc distance determinations have been found. For example, CUL MS 3965.14, f. 614v
 lists, "Dec 30, 9 pm the comet was in the line drawn through the southern-most of
 the two stars in the breast of Pegasus [λ Peg] toward the middle star in the belly of

 Cassiopeia [rç Cas]. It was distant from that southern star 3/4 of the distance that the

 southern one was from the northern one [μ Peg], and was located on the south side of
 both stars."20 By April 1681, the only one of these observations Newton regarded as

 tolerably accurate was for January 11, and only after juggling the parameters (Newton
 1959—1977. 7 η nn 365-366V

 Newton switched to a seven foot telescope on January 30. Extant notes do not
 include major reference stars that would have been needed to determine the comet's
 coordinates (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 598; MS Add. 4004, f. lOOr; see also below).
 Even less complete notes are found for Newton's observation of February 5 (CUL
 MS Add. 3965.14, f. 615r). In short order, he devised a micrometer for this larger

 instrument to make precise measurements as the comet faded further from view. What
 may have been a trial run with the micrometer was made on February 10 (CUL MS
 Add. 3965.14, f. 615r). Detailed observations still using nonstandard star descriptions
 were made with this device from February 26 to March 9 but (as discussed below)
 evidently not reduced to standard coordinates until 1684. Newton also used a sector
 to obtain certain angle measurements (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 554v). In this case,

 18 Newton's student notes indicate the same practice, following Snell (1619) who also recorded observations

 on simple fractions of an hour (McGuire and Martin Tamny 1983, pp. 412-419). A point that needs further

 research is how and who regulated clocks at Cambridge during these years.

 19 It is interesting to note that one of the scholars also used a small pocket perspective when viewing the
 November comet (Newton 1957-1977,2, p. 344).

 5 Newton's first calculations

 By early January, Newton had several fully reduced observations of his own, Flam
 steed's original report for December 12 and a second letter from Flamsteed dated
 January 3, 1680/1681 providing positions for December 21, 24,26, and 30 with mod
 erately detailed descriptions of the tail. Newton quickly put these data to use. The
 actual worksheets are missing or not yet identified. Only summaries remain in CUL
 MS Add. 3965.14, f. 598 and MS. 3965.11, f. 153r. I prefer to think of these and
 related documents as having been retrieved from Newton's 'waste basket' because of

 mistakes or work completed elsewhere. It is easy to imagine Newton shifting from
 sheet to sheet, whatever was at hand, as he recorded observations, drew sketches, made

 calculations, assembled notes, and generally progressed with his work. Much of this

 material, especially the most polished effort, is lost. As such, extant documents indicate

 the direction of Newton's work but do not necessarily reflect his settled thoughts.

 Results listed in CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 598 were based on Flamsteed's obser

 vations from December 12 to December 26 (as originally reported) and Newton's
 observations of December 30, January 4 and 11.12 The times of Flamsteed's observa

 tions were rounded to the nearest quarter hour in agreement with Newton's practice.
 This procedure neglected roughly 1' or 2' changes in Flamsteed's positions. Changes
 in the manuscript indicate Newton discovered mistakes which he partially corrected
 before moving on to other work. The calculations might have been done during a
 spell of bad weather from January 13 to January 22.23 No obvious application has
 been found. As a student, Newton had copied similar information from Snell (1619)

 without bothering to include Snell's subsequent treatment of the ascending node. Now

 Newton's work came to depend heavily on the apparent position of the ascending node.

 When and how it became an active factor in Newton's analysis is not clear to me.

 Shortly after completing this treatment of apparent motion from December 12 to

 January 11, Newton turned to the more difficult task of determining the comet's actual

 trajectory under the assumption of uniform rectilinear motion. Again the original
 work sheets are missing. Only a summary of the work is extant (CUL MS Add.
 3965.11, f. 153r). For example, the apparent distance of the comet from the sun on
 December 21,4:30 pm was 31°59' while the corresponding true distance was 52,912

 21 The sector would have permitted measurements of star altitudes from which the apparent time and
 equation of time could be calculated, if that was his method.

 22 Newton did not list the coordinates and provided only the distance between each pair of dates. For
 example Newton indicated the distance between the comet on January 4, 8 pm and January 11, 10:30 pm
 was I4°55'. My reductions using Newton's parameters and Tycho's co-ordinates plus 68' place the comet
 on January 4 at about Τ 6°51 26°36' Ν and on January 11 at T' 22°52', 23°12' Vi Ν . The distance
 between these positions calculated by the cosine rule is I4°54'.

 23 The Paris observations had a gap between January 13 and 23. The gap at Greenwich was between January

 11 and 25. Newton obtained a partial view on January 13. The final round of correspondence with Burnet
 on the sacred theory of the earth was completed late in this period (Newton 1959-1977,2, pp. 321-335).

 (a.u. — 100,000). Newton was thinking of work eventually covering both sets of
 appearances because the sheet starts with mean solar positions at noon based on tables

 in Wing (1669) for 10 day intervals from November 10, 1680 to March 30, 1681 plus
 December 12, the date of Flamsteed's first observation.

 Newton specified the comet's positions for only three dates with corresponding solar
 positions based on Wing. Two of them were Flamsteed's observations for December
 21 and 30 as posted on January 3 (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 354). He did not round
 off Flamsteed's times as before but assumed the observations were made according
 to equated time. He remained unaware that Flamsteed used true solar or apparent
 time until mid-February. Flamsteed's observation for the 30th was used rather than
 Newton's observation as in the previous document. The third place was Newton's
 observation of January 11 calculated for 10 pm rather than 10:30 as in that previous
 document (Newton had made several measurements over the course of 2 h). The

 latitude determined for the 11th was based on a 10 arc minute distance from sigma

 Pisces rather than the 9 arc minute parameter cited in Newton's letter of April 16,1681.

 The stated logarithms of the sun-earth distances were seriously defective, for example,
 placing the earth closer to the sun on January 11 than on December 21. Several other

 listings have calculation or tabulation errors up to several minutes.24

 Worked in reverse, Newton's parameters describe to graphical accuracy a straight

 line path reduced to the plane of the ecliptic at a uniform speed of about 0.0471
 a.u./day or some three times the earth's mean speed (see Fig. I).25 A slight scatter in

 the reconstructed latitudes leads to some uncertainty in the exact time and place when
 the comet crossed the ecliptic, but it would have occurred around November 23 about

 0.9 a.u. from the sun, as if emerging from the depths of space at a geocentric longitude
 of about /14°.

 A fourth position would have been required to calculate such a path but Newton
 provided no parameters in the summary. December 12, already included in the pre
 liminary list of solar positions, would have been the logical choice but Flamsteed's
 original coordinates do not fit Newton's solution. After a further look associated with
 the initial arc distance calculations, Newton may have set it aside as unreliable because

 at the first opportunity he queried Flamsteed as to whether allowance had been made
 for refraction in its reduction.26 If Newton used another observed position there would

 have been no reason not to list it. Did he use extrapolated parameters for the node as
 a fourth point? The information listed by Newton establishes only the heliocentric
 longitude of the node which could have been obtained after the fact. By long stand

 ing practice the place of the node was readily determined using any two observations

 24 For example, in what could be a tabulation error, the comet's elongation from the sun on January 11,
 10 pm is given as 80.17°(80° 10') whereas the sun's longitude is given as & 2.7°(2°42') and the comet's
 longitude as Τ 22.817°22°49' for a difference of 80.117°(80°7').

 25 Newton commonly made calculations using ratios but sometimes used decimal equivalents.

 26 Flamsteed had corrected for refraction but had made a mistake in the position of the planet Venus

 used for one of the reference points. The corrected value differed by almost 2° longitude and 1° latitude
 (Newton 1959-1977,2, p. 353). Most importantly the revised position fitted its expected spot along Newton's

 rectilinear path.

 Fig. 1 Comet of 1680 reconstruction of Newton's original path (January 1680/81)

 assuming the path followed a great circle arc.27 The methods of Problem 16 or some
 other extrapolation technique would be needed to determine a date.28 I have been
 unable to calculate geocentric parameters for the node that agree with those revealed

 in the reconstruction, although to be sure there are uncertainties in the exact placement

 of the node in that reconstruction. There are too many uncertainties to determine the

 approach Newton used or why he did not list parameters for the required fourth posi

 tion. The lack of details for a position on January 23 or 24 may indicate the calculations

 were made before those observations or only Newton's distrust in their accuracy. The

 solution was certainly accomplished before the middle of February when Flamsteed's
 first set of revised data arrived.29

 Newton shifted to a seven foot telescope on January 30. Notes for the observation
 (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 598), added below the calculations of apparent motion
 discussed above, included a map, distances between the comet and stars within a few

 arc minutes, and a brief account of the tail. The reference points were telescopic or
 small uncharted stars along the comet's path between the constellations Triangulus
 and Perseus designated a, b, c, etc., for which no coordinates were available. Newton

 noted the position of the tail in relation to major stars such as Capella and Algol but

 listed no alignments of the head with these stars from which the comet's coordinates

 27 Newton may not have ventured beyond the analysis in the Snell/Rothmann (1619) and not yet realized

 how greatly the apparent position of the node can vary with different selections of data points, as in the case
 of 1680 (Forbes 1975, p. 28; Ruffner 2010, pp. 436-437).

 28 In 1685 Newton offered a graphical method to resolve Problem 16 more accurately in System of the
 World, Lemmas 3-5 (Newton 1728, pp. 147-150; Newton 1960, pp. 623-624).

 29 Wren also found from Flamsteed's observations of December and January that the comet was moving
 in accord with his hypothesis of uniform straight motion (Birch 1756-1757, 4, p. 67). At this point Wren
 believed there were two comets. Wren's reaction to Flamsteed's subsequent hypothesis of a single comet
 is not known.

 could be calculated. Newton may have at least marked the approximate position on a
 globe. The entry concluded with an indication the comet moved about 5° from day 24
 to day 30. This part of the document represents work in progress around January 30
 or 31, 1680/1681. Around the end of January and early February, as will be shown,

 Newton was also trying to reconstruct details of the local November observations and

 had begun a systematic survey of historic comets, evidently beginning with Riccioli
 n/ssn

 Newton's third entry on CUL MS 3965.14, f. 598 (right panel) provided observa
 tions made by an anonymous person in Hamburg during December and early January.

 Since the entry is in English it would seem Newton copied it from a letter sent by a

 traveler to him or a colleague. Newton made no mention of these observations in his
 letter of February 28, 1680/1681. A revamped version in Latin was partially inserted

 in the margin and partially in chronological order with similar data in Newton's Waste
 Book (CUL MS Add. 4004, ff. 99r/v). It would seem Newton obtained the Hamburg
 information in late March or early April 1681 just as he was in the midst of making

 the compilation.

 6 Newton's initial gathering of data

 CUL MS Add. 3965.14, 613v-614r/v-613r entitled "Observationes & Scolia" has

 four distinct sections (Ruffner 2000). The first entry under the title at the top of folio
 613v was a report of observations for December 15, 16, and 19, 1680 (subsequently
 identified in the Waste Book as from Scotland).30 A list of memorable comets and

 associated phenomena followed. Newton's observations from December 29 to January

 24 and a note for December 15 were added later because they snake around these initial

 entries. The entry for January 4 included an estimate of the maximum distance of the

 comet from the sun based on the apparent length of the tail. The calculations were
 made on the verso and the entry for January 11 was written to avoid obliterating
 them.31 Untitled statements I have termed Propositiones de cometis were added still

 later from the end opposite the last observation on folio 613r. Attention has focused

 on these propositions because they contradict many points made by Newton in the
 Flamsteed correspondence and include a mixture of "new" and "old" ideas about the
 gravitational nature of comets from a later stage of development. Conjectured dates

 for the propositions have fluctuated between 1681 and 1684 or 1685 (Whiteside 1970,
 p. 14; Westfall 1971, pp. 459-460; Dobbs 1988, pp. 77-78; Bertoloni Meli 1993,
 p. 171; Ruffner 2000, p. 271).

 1 he memorable listings and observations prove on close analysis to be 01 compa
 rable significance to the propositions and can be dated with reasonable certainty to

 late January or early February 1680/1681. For example, the information from Scot

 land was cited in Newton's letter of February 28. Also the description of the tail for

 30 The original report included a mangled statement that mixed equatorial and ecliptic coordinates which

 Newton converted to preferred ecliptic style for the Latin version in the Waste Book, f. 99r. Its entry in the

 margin near the appropriate date may indicate Newton temporarily misplaced the sheet or only belatedly

 decided to include the information after correcting the error.

 31 The method is described in Newton (Newton 1728, pp. 127-128; Newton 1960, pp. 612-614).

 December 15 was replaced in the subsequent Waste Book compilation by Flamsteed's

 description received in mid-February. Further, the observation for January 11 included

 the 10' parameter used in the rectilinear resolution rather than the 9' parameter cited
 in April. Such dates in 1680/1681 by themselves settle nothing about the date for the

 propositions because an individual document can span decades of use.

 The memorable comets comprised a dozen appearing between 431 B.C. and 1618

 A.D. selected based on reports of an extraordinary tail, great brilliance, or long duration.

 The list was consistent with what could have been gleaned from Riccioli (1651, pt. 2,

 v. 1, bk. 8, pp. 3-18, passim). A longer list would have been expected from the treatises
 of Hevelius (1668) and Lubieniecki (1666-1668) which presented more comprehen
 sive and more detailed compilations. The great comet described by Aristotle was dated

 372 B.c. perhaps in keeping with Riccioli who dated it 372 or 373 B.c.32

 The memorable comets were followed by lists of phenomena noted in some thirty

 one comets since 1530. This material (Newton's scholia) was for the most part com
 patible with what could have been gleaned from Riccioli and would have been used by
 Newton to demonstrate location in the vicinity of the sun. Comet tails stand more or

 less opposite the sun and bend backward from the direction of motion.33 The comets

 of 1577, 1585, and 1590 had no sensible parallax, the point being when last reported

 these comets were well beyond the orbit of the moon but close enough to the earth to
 be visible to the naked eye. The comets of 1582, 1596, and 1607 exhibited parallax
 from annual motion, another indication of positions amongst the planets. The comets

 of 1577, 1582, 1585, and 1569 did not follow a great circle exactly near the end of vis

 ibility when their apparent motions were very slow, arguably the result of the earth's

 annual motion and positions not far the sun.34 Newton sorted the information into
 categories indicating the part of the heavens traversed: opposite the sun, in the solar

 region, in the polar region, in more than one region, or in unspecified regions with the

 ff. 172r-173v drafted in 1685 as a worksheet for De Motu Corporum Liber Secundus, CUL MS Add. 3990.
 Newton selected more than fifty major comets and accepted Hevelius' date of 371 BC for 'Aristotle's'
 comet. See Ruffner 2010, pp. 429^4-32.

 Tycho, Kepler, Gassendi, Hevelius, and others noted deviations from strict anti-solarity. Published indi

 cations that the deviation was backwards from the line of motion however have not been found. Newton's

 generalizations, here and elsewhere, may have been based on just a few examples in his own observations.
 Flamsteed's analogy of smoke trailing from a moving ship was also consistent with Newton's view.

 -14 Riccioli did not provide exact statements of great circle departures in these four examples. Tycho had

 touted the exquisite apparent great circle path of the comet of 1577 and the data provided by Riccioli (p. 11 )

 was clearly based on such a track. The only counterclaim noted by Riccioli (p. 52) was due to Claramontius in

 Antitycho ( 1621 ). Whether Newton accepted Claramontius or used some other source is not clear. Riccioli's

 information for the comet of 1582 (p. 13) extracted from Kepler (1619, p. 126) indicated it was retrograde
 and became stationary at the end. Newton might have understood this evidence as indicating departure
 from a great circle track. Tycho's data for 1585 provided by Riccioli (p. 14) revealed a slight decline from
 an initial great circle track as was also demonstrated by Rothmann (Snell 1619, p. 85). Riccioli (p. 10)
 credited Kepler (1619, pp. 114, 129) with information the comet of 1569 deflected from its line of motion
 and became stationary at the end but Kepler provided different information about the comet of 1659 on
 those pages. The information on deflection in fact pertained to the comet of 1596 which Riccioli properly
 cited as from Kepler (1619, p. 120). Newton evidently accepted Riccioli's erroneous information about the

 comet 1569 without noting the discrepancy when selecting the comet of 1596 as an example indicating
 parallax due to the earth s annual motion. The error was first noted by Pingré (1783-1784, 1, p. 510).

 largest number appearing in the solar region. Again, the lists were compatible with
 Riccioli's accounts except for comets in 1664, 1665, and 1680 seen by Newton. Four
 comets observed in 1618 were listed as 18 with four superscripts. The inclusion of
 only a single 80 would seem to support a date for the document after 1681 except the

 80 seems to have been added later.35 The lack of an entry for 1682 supports an earlier

 date for this part of the manuscript.

 Perhaps the most revealing item for dating the memorable list around the beginning

 ofFebruary 1680/1681 is an entry "1531 bis" signifying that twice comets crossed the

 solar region. A comet appeared in the evening and again shortly after in the morning.

 Hevelius ( 1668, p. 909) accepted Peter Apian's view they were the same comet. Newton

 adopted the view reported by Riccioli ( 1651, pt. 2, p. 9) that two comets appeared. This
 bifurcation indicates Newton was not yet using Hevelius as he would before the end

 of February.36 Apart from the outline of propositions the rest of the Observationes
 & Scolia document represents work in January or early February 1680/1681. Such
 a compilation indicates Newton was contemplating an extended treatment of comets

 apart from any stimulus from Flamsteed. It would not have been necessary to convince

 Flamsteed of any of these ideas apart from the notion that two comets in 1531 prefigured

 the current situation. The obvious target, if only for private satisfaction, was Descartes
 who placed comets beyond the sphere of Saturn or the scholastic tradition of the
 Catholic Church that considered them terrestrial phenomena.

 7 Newton's 'crazy quilt' document

 Over time beginning in February 1680/1681, Newton collected a crazy quilt of infor
 mation about comets (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, ff. 615r/v-616r/v), some of which

 never appeared again, and some of which did not appear until the third edition of the
 Principia (1726). Fragments of Newton's observations on February 5 (CUL MS Add.
 3965.14, f. 615r) include a sketched map of the comet within a few arc minutes of
 telescopic stars identified by strange designations such as 7c, 9a, 9d, and 10e. The next
 entries are fragments of Newton's observations for February 10 which do not include
 arc measurements but rather micrometer values that may represent a test phase for
 the new device. These fragments are followed by a map and significant material con
 cerning observations between February 25 and March 9 (f. 615r/v).37 The details and
 accompanying map on the document were augmented at least once and added piece
 meal in different editions of the Principia (1686, pp. 491-^193; 1718, pp. 456-457;
 1999, pp. 905-908).

 35 A small 80 was squeezed in above the capital letter that begins the category in the next line, possibly

 at a later time using a different quill. There was ample room for double entries if Newton wanted them. In

 1680/1681 Newton may not have made any entry for 1680 because he intended to list only the prior comets,
 but we cannot be certain. See facsimile (Ruffner 2000, p. 261 ).

 36 Having completely changed his mind, Newton drafted an enhanced version (CUL MS Add. 3965.11,
 f. 172r) in 1685 that lists 1531 as a single comet along with the notation 1680= 1681. See facsimile (Ruffner
 2010, p. 431).

 37 The gap in Newton's observations from February 11 to 24 was largely due to bad weather or the obscuring

 effect of the full moon. Observations at Paris Observatory had a similar gap between February 12 and 27.

 Newton used an arcane process to convert the micrometer readings to arc mea

 sures from which position coordinates could be calculated. Basically he corrected the
 readings by subtracting some constant factor (CUL MS Add. 3965.14A2, f. 554r).
 Entries on the crazy quilt document indicate Newton had some difficulty in deciding

 the proper value. Correction factors for numerous pairs of identifiable stars ranged

 from 27 2/12 parts to 27 3V2/12 parts. This work evidently dated to about March 1681.

 Another star plot and table on the flip side used a correction factor of 27 3/12 parts

 for an indeterminate group of stars (f. 616v).38 Information cited in April 1681 was
 drafted to avoid obliterating this information. None of these correction factors have
 been found in other documents.

 The corrected readings can be converted to arc distances once the distance between

 the two reference stars in the south (left according to Tycho, right according to Bayer)
 foot of Perseus is known. Incomplete entries in the Waste Book (CUL MS Add. 4004,

 f. 97r) used a correction factor of 25 8/12 parts as in all editions of the Principia
 but included an erroneous distance of 1°46'6°Newton discovered inconsistency
 in the cross distances and left the summary incomplete. If the error was discovered
 in 1680/1681, Newton sought no help and did not press the issue. Indeed, in April
 1681 Newton claimed he did not yet have their accurate coordinates.40 At the same

 time, if not very forcefully, Newton suggested that Flamsteed might consider fresh

 determinations of the coordinates for another star. It is likely the aborted Waste Book

 entries represented work in December 1684 after Newton settled on a proper correc

 tion factor for the micrometer readings and just before seeking help from Flamsteed
 (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 403^08).41

 8 Collégial exchanges

 Flamsteed had not seen the comet in November, but based on the report from his
 assistant at Greenwich and others Flamsteed predicted it would be seen again in the
 evening after passing the sun and eagerly awaited the return. When a tail appeared
 in the evening of December 10, Flamsteed began observations extending to Febru
 ary 8 which he passed seriatim to Newton and others. Giovanni Domenico Cassini

 began observations at the Paris observatory extending from December 19 to January
 13, with cruder observations extending to March 8. Cassini also received November

 observations from observatories in the south of France and Italy where conditions
 had been better. Halley, who temporarily assisted Cassini, forwarded this material to

 The maximum differences resulting from these correction factors would have amounted to about 5'

 or 6'.

 39 This data is the first entry of the section in the Waste Book devoted to comets. As explained in the
 appendix, the entry was probably one of Newton's last additions after earlier notes on comets ran out of

 space and reverted to a blank folio at the beginning of the section.

 40 The stars were omicron and zeta Perseus. Coordinates were readily available in Tycho's tables used by
 Newton for other work at the time. Fresh measurements from Flamsteed in 1684 established the distance

 at the beginning of 1681 as 2°6'46". Tycho's coordinates would have yielded 2°10°28". Newton's result
 is a mystery unless it was one of his many computational errors.

 41 A list of corrected values using different terminology is found in CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 552. The

 data for March 7 is deleted and also omitted from the first edition of the Principia but restored later.

 The snare of simplicity: the Newton-Flamsteed correspondence revisited 431

 Flamsteed who also received data from other correspondents on the continent, notably

 in Germany. In addition, Flamsteed received via another party several November obser

 vations from Thomas Hill, an amateur astronomer at Canterbury, the first one of which

 gave endless trouble for Newton and Cassini who tried to use it. Many other channels

 of information flowed through the Royal Society where comets and particularly the
 comets of 1680 and 1681 were avidly discussed. Even the possibility of very short
 lived sublunary comets was discussed (Birch 1756-1757, 4, p. 66).

 Flamsteed's lost third letter of February 12, 1680/1681 to Newton by way of James
 Crompton included the first complete set of Greenwich observations from December

 12 to February 5, observations for December 19 to January 13 from the Paris observa

 tory, a garbled set of November observations by Jean Charles Gallet said to have been
 made at Rome, as well as a crude preview of Flamsteed's single comet solution.42 In

 accord with his usual practice, Newton analyzed the arc distances between the comet's

 positions as soon as data were received. An examination of the Greenwich and Paris

 observations during December, January, and February as received in February proved

 them both sufficiently accurate, a view modified by further work in March or April.
 Gallet's observations from November, however, posed serious problems. About this

 time, Ellis showed Newton a letter by Cassini supporting a two comet solution (Newton

 1959-1977, 2, p. 342).43 Obviously, Ellis, the colleague who probably roused New
 ton's interest and assisted in the observation of December 15, had his own contacts.

 Could Ellis have been the conduit for the Scottish and Hamburg observations?

 The precise details of Flamsteed's theory in the third letter have been lost because
 Newton copied only the useful data. Judging from Newton's response of February 28,

 1680/1681, they were substantially the same as those sent to Halley on February 17,
 1680/1681 (Newton 1959-1977,2, pp. 336-340). In his first response (Newton 1959—

 1977,2, pp. 340-347), Newton utterly rejected the purported solution of a single comet

 by which it was magnetically attracted by the sun during ingress, made a U turn before

 reaching the sun, and was repulsed during egress. Newton could allow an attractive
 power in the sun whereby the planets were kept in their orbits but argued it could not be

 magnetic as commonly understood because the vast heat of the sun would destroy it.
 As for comets, like the little needle of a compass, Newton argued, they would always
 be directed to the sun. Moreover, if a comet were so attracted it would never cross in

 front of the sun against the vortex flow but would be continuously attracted and made

 to fetch a compass about the sun. Allowing hypotheses to be shaped in the best manner

 for a confrere to use, however, was not the same as Newton accepting their validity.44

 42 Flamsteed or a copyist carelessly mixed old and new style dates. The same mistake was sent to Richard
 Towneley on February 7, 1680/1681 (Flamsteed 1995-2002, 1, p. 756.) The data sent to John Caswell on
 February 4 had correct dates, ibid., 1, p. 753 In the Principia the correct place is Avignon as indicated by
 Cassini (1681).

 43 Cassini's book (1681) evidently did not arrive in England until May 1681 although there were two
 impressions under different titles. Hooke gave a review at the Royal Society meeting of June 8 (Birch
 1756-1757,4, p. 90).

 44 Later, in an unsent draft of April, Newton pointed out that Flamsteed's explanation required the speed of

 the comet to increase continuously. By that time, Flamsteed had recognized the problem which he solved by
 assuming the comet had attained its highest possible speed during ingress which weakened with increased
 distance from the sun (Forbes 1975, p. 115).

 Newton agreed only that the path of a comet moving across the streamlines of the
 solar vortex would be somewhat deflected by the pressure of the flow, independent
 of any action by the sun. Later, Newton did in fact introduce some slight curvature
 in the path but failed to allow for a reduction of speed that also would have been
 entailed. Such retardation would have been most evident in the tail resulting in the
 backward deflection noted in Newton's "Observation.es & Scolia." While Newton

 432 J. A. Ruffner

 granted approval to various aspects of Flamsteed's theory of the tail, presumably as
 detailed in a letter intended for Halley (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 339), he broke off
 the discussion as too tedious (too obvious?) without addressing Flamsteed's analogy
 between the deflection of a comet's tail and smoke that trails behind the chimney

 of a moving ship due to air resistance (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 345-346). Since
 Newton allowed the vortex to deflect the path of a comet moving transversely across

 the pattern of flow, he would have agreed that the particles of the tail should have met
 resistance as a result of their cross current motion. There also should have been some

 slight retardation of the main body of the head of the comet, in contradiction to the

 principle of uniform motion.

 9 The November comet

 Newton and others at Cambridge who had not seen the comet in November had for

 some time been interested in those appearances. In early December, a Fellow of Trinity
 interviewed a scholar about what he had seen. About the end of January, Newton
 pressed the scholar for further details. The scholar initially recalled that around 4
 a.m. on November 16, later corrected to November 19, the comet was about two

 degrees north of Spica which would have placed the comet very near the ecliptic in
 about Q 21° for an arc distance from the sun on the 16th of about 45°. The scholar

 also remembered a long comet tail extending to another first magnitude star, Deneb
 (the lion's tail), placing the end of the tail at about 17°, 12° N, about 36° from
 the head. Framed by such prominent stars these results could hardly be doubted. In
 a related interview, Humphrey Babbington recalled that around November 22 or 23
 the tail ran just above the east end of Kings College Chapel rising a little higher at
 the west end. The head was hidden by buildings or located some distance below the

 horizon. Amplifying this report, most likely through the use of a globe or other analog

 device, Newton determined that at about 5 a.m. on either date alpha Corvus (its beak)

 was situated near the top of the Chapel's east end while the constellation Crater (the

 cup), more particularly alpha Crater, was situated a little higher and slightly beyond the

 Chapel's west end. Further, Newton estimated that the arc distance of the head from the

 beak was between 20° and 30° or a little more. Taking alpha Corvus at about Q 8°, 22°
 S and the sun November 23, 5 a.m. at about / 12°, the arc distance would be about

 66°. The simplest model, assuming an exact alignment of the sun, comet and end of the

 tail, would place the comet's head slightly below the horizon about 20° from the beak.

 A distance of 30° (or better 33°) would have yielded a value with the observed length

 on November 16 and placed the head well below the horizon at roughly HL8°, 11° S,
 about half way between the beak and the sun (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 343-344).
 At some point in this process of reconstructing the circumstances of Novem
 ber, Newton received Flamsteed's botched set of Gallet's November observations.

 The snare of simplicity: the Newton-Flamsteed correspondence revisited 433

 The longitudes were clearly wrong, were the latitudes any more reliable? Gallet's
 observations indicated the November comet when first observed on November 17 was

 at the ecliptic, dipped to about 4° south latitude on November 21 and began to return
 northward before being lost on November 27 as it advanced toward the sun. Flamsteed

 took this behavior as evidence the comet was being attracted by the sun. Flamsteed
 also considered the continued northward tract in December evidence the comet was

 then being repulsed by the sun and accordingly evoked an explanation requiring the
 head to be polarized.

 Newton diverted his research interests long enough to provide Flamsteed with

 detailed reasons why the attraction (if any) could not be magnetic and why Gallet's

 observations did not support a one comet solution. Trusting the gist of local accounts,

 Newton argued the latitude of the comet was much further south than in any of Gallet's

 observations and that within a few days later the comet probably continued so far south

 as not to be seen any longer (Newton 1959-1977,2, p. 344). Newton obviously believed
 the November comet continued on a trajectory slightly inclined from north to south

 uninfluenced by the sun. This comet was quite distinct from the comet which according

 to Newton's analysis emerged from the depths of space in December and followed a

 south to north path under no solar influence. Newton cited the greater brilliance of the
 head in November described by the scholar informant as additional evidence for two
 different comets.

 In the meantime, Flamsteed received (via Halley) Cassini's copy of Marco Antonio
 Cellio's observations at Rome (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 349). These observations
 showed the comet advancing toward the sun with near constant latitude 1° S. About

 the same time, Flamsteed received Thomas Hill's observation at Canterbury predating
 all the others that showed the comet at about 2° Ν on the morning of November 11
 (Newton 1959-1977, p. 349). Newton's objections were received soon afterwards giv

 ing Flamsteed pause to think more deeply. Responding with his fourth letter of March
 7, also sent by way of James Crompton, Flamsteed argued the similarity of appar
 ent motion in longitude before and after passing their perigees (or points of swiftest

 apparent motion) proved their identity and Flamsteed reiterated the contention that
 the sun's magnetism attracted the comet during its ingress and repulsed it during the
 return. Flamsteed also faulted Newton for the mistake in Gallet's data and sent a cor

 rect copy. Although Flamsteed praised Gallet's general skills, he downgraded these

 observations except for the last one which agreed well enough with Cellio. Given fresh

 support from Hill and Cellio, Flamsteed asked how the comet could have started off

 north of the ecliptic dipped southward and then maintain nearly constant latitude with
 out supposing attraction by the sun (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 348-350). Flamsteed

 also entered a plea for help in deciding between a turn around the sun and a turn short
 of the sun (see Sect. 16).

 In further diversions from his work, Newton (1959-1977,2, pp. 358-359) acknowl
 edged the two comets were less irreconcilable (largely because the trajectory of the
 November comet was not as erratic as indicated by the bungled set of Gallet's obser

 vations) but numerous flaws in Flamsteed's argument from the similarity of apparent

 motion precluded definitive agreement. Flamsteed failed to allow for changes in lati

 tude and the accidents of actual distance. As for Flamsteed's claim the nearly constant

 latitude in Cellio's observations proved such attraction, Newton countered there was

 too much scatter in the various sets to be conclusive. Ignoring Flamsteed's discount
 ing of Gallet's observations, Newton included them with Hill's observation and the
 superior observations of Cellio and argued none could be trusted to accuracy greater
 than half a degree or even one degree. Given this uncertainty Newton asked why the
 comet could not have retained a course continuously decreasing from about 2° Ν to

 something greater than 1° S before being lost in dawn's early light. This last latitude
 was considerably smaller than previously imagined but Newton was not about to con
 cede solar attraction of the November comet any more than in the case of the comet
 that anneared in December.

 434 J. A. Ruffner

 A dubious claim in Flamsteed's theory (not found in his letter to Halley) added

 more grist for Newton's two comet solution. Flamsteed argued comets usually verge
 from south to north. Newton found from a search of comet histories, now probably

 including Hevelius (1666) and more recent sources, comparable numbers of comet
 moving southward as northward (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 345). Thus a southward
 moving comet in November was in good company. An interesting side note concerns

 Newton's listing of the otherwise unknown comet of 1666 seen by Robert Knox while

 in captivity in Ceylon. According to Knox (1681, p. 60), "In the year 1666 in the month

 of February there appeared in this Countrey another comet or stream in the West, the

 head under the Horizon, much resembling that which was seen in England in the year
 1680 in December." The account was not yet published but reached Newton by the
 nhilosonhical eranevine.45

 An important new item in Flamsteed's March 7 letter was a terse account of Halley's

 observation of a comet's tail in the morning of December 8 while en route to Paris—it

 was sticking straight up from the horizon with the head still hidden. The circumstances

 indicated the comet was nearing conjunction with the sun and had already crossed the
 ecliptic. Newton, as well as Halley, identified this appearance with the comet seen in

 the evening later in December moving on a northward track. It could not have been the
 last appearance of the November comet which, despite Flamsteed's entreaties, Newton
 believed to have continued beyond the sun on a nearly straight southward track.

 10 Newton presses his research agenda

 Newton's initial response of February 28 went beyond a critique of Flamsteed's theory

 with a request for clarification or amplification of a number of points in Flamsteed's

 observations. When the head was first observed December 12, was it by naked eye or

 only through glasses and with what magnitude? Perhaps recognizing the poor fit of the
 observation in his rectilinear solution, Newton asked whether refraction was allowed

 for in computing its place. More generally, Flamsteed had described the appearance

 of the head as having scattered points of bright light which Flamsteed attributed to

 the reflection of solar rays from the solid parts of a broken globe that poked above
 a poorly reflecting fluid surface. Newton agreed that "ye atmosphere about ye head

 45 Knox returned to England in September 1680. Wren recommended the publication of Knox's memoir.
 Hooke's preface was dated August 1, 1681. When the December comet appeared Knox must have told
 friends of resemblances between it and what he had seen in 1666 and a report somehow reached Newton.
 Comets were a hot philosophical topic.

 shines ... by the sun's light" but added the caveat "though not altogether by it," as
 if there were an internal source of light (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 346). The basis
 for the caveat evidently was Newton's observation for January 4 that while there was

 no bright 'star' in the center, the head was brighter in the center and gradually faded
 toward the circumference. Of course, the fading could have been due to a decrease in

 the density of reflecting matter. Hevelius (1668, Fig. F, p. 882, passim), now clearly on

 Newton's reading list, included reports by Hevelius and Cysatus of "great & perpetual

 variations" in the head. Deferring to Flamsteed's greater authority, Newton sought

 addition details that would clarify the role of the sun in illuminating the head (Newton
 1959-1977, 2, p. 346).

 Newton also asked for details of the placement of the tail in relation to nearby stars

 on dates when he had not minded it, namely December 10,11, 12,15, and 21. Newton
 did not ask about details on December 29 or later because he had his own observations.

 In a continued spirit of cooperation, Newton offered preliminary information on his

 observations of February 25 and 27 in the hope that Flamsteed would resume telescopic
 observations that ceased on February 5. As always, Newton wanted data rather than

 the ideas of others. To help Flamsteed find the comet again, Newton included a rough

 map locating recent positions in relation to key stars. Newton also offered Flamsteed

 the opportunity to request his recent observations and those he would make after one

 or two more clear days.46 Chiefly, however, Newton wanted descriptions of the tail in

 December in order to develop a thought that had come to mind that very day (Newton

 1959-1977,2, p. 346). Newton had already determined how to use the apparent length

 of a tail to fix the maximum distance of a comet. This new thought must have been
 the germ of Newton's ill-fated law of tails.

 11 Toward a harmonious law of tails

 Flamsteed's fourth letter of March 7 sent by way of Crompton included most of the

 detailed descriptions of the tail requested by Newton along with a plea by Flamsteed
 to help resolve a dilemma between a turn short of the sun and a path around the
 sun. Because he had been absent from Cambridge from March 15 to 26 Newton did
 not receive the letter until his return (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 363, 367 η. 1, 2).
 Newton quickly put Flamsteed's descriptions of the tail to work. Enhanced versions

 were included in what I call the "crazy quilt" document under the title, "ExAstrolabio
 Flamstedif (CUL MS Add. 3965. 14, f. 616v)47 Newton evidently had taken details

 from Flamsteed's letter, plotted them on a celestial globe or star chart and determined

 more precise coordinates of the termini and intervening positions by following great

 circle arcs or other smooth curves. For example, Flamsteed indicated, "[December] 12.

 after it became darke it passed over ye middle of the Sagitta, but extended not far beyond
 it" (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 352). According to Newton's subsequent elaboration
 (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 616v), "The tail ended with a sharply defined terminus at

 46 It is doubtful Newton understood at this point the effort required to get these observations into usable
 form.

 47 This material is inserted from the opposite end of the map and table of unknown stars cited in note 38.
 What Newton meant by Flamsteed's astrolabe is unclear to me.

 the two small stars in the middle of Sagitta. The axis of the tail was equidistant from
 the two small stars in the foot of Antinous, from the left elbow of Antinous from the

 bend of the left wing of Corvus [slip for Aquila], And that distance was one third of
 the distance between the elbow of Antinous and the star at the end of the end of the

 436 J. A. Ruffner

 Serpent's tail."48 What seems to be the earliest compilation of these results was in the
 next group of entries (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 616v). The terminus for December
 12 was listed as 6 lat 43. Only a few other intended dates were filled in, but Newton

 continued to work on the problem. He also began to compile the information received
 from Flamsteed and other sources in his Waste Book, adding further details based on

 his own analysis.

 Newton used the enhanced data to develop what he viewed as a harmonious law
 of tails. Newton's basic premise was that the apparent ends of the tail fall very nearly
 along a great circle, perhaps by analogy with the apparent track of the head. He
 imagined that if the complex procedures outlined in CUL MS Add. 4004, f. 101 r were

 implemented, the locus of the terminal positions "must be in either a geometric or

 arithmetic progression or some other regular function no matter what."49 In practice,
 Newton evidently found the best great circle fit for terminal positions plotted on a

 celestial globe, noting (CUL MS Add. 4004, f. 101 r), "if a great circle which cut the
 ecliptic in / 20° at an angle of 54° is drawn on a globe it passes by the star in the
 northern wing of Sagittae [a Sag], then by the 4th magnitude star in the eastern arm
 of Cassiopeia [0 Cas], then by the star in the back of Perseus [i Per] or by a point

 about 1/4 degree further south."50 These great circle positions outline very nearly the
 observed end of the tail on December 11, December 26, and January 4. A few lines

 later, the position of the node was listed as / 20° 1/3 at an angle of 54°. According
 to the Waste Book, the ascending node of node of great circle envelope of the tail
 termini cut the ecliptic in / 20° 1/3 at an angle of 54°. This position was changed in
 the "crazy quilt" document to / 19° I /2 at an angle of 52° or 52° 1 /2 and again in

 48 Cauda desinebat accurate ad exiguas duas stellas in medio Sagittae. A stellis duabus in pede Antinoi,
 a cubito sinistrae Antonoi ab ancone alae sinistrae axis caudae equidistabat et distantia ilia erat tertia pars
 distantiae cubiti illius Antonoi a Stella in termino caudae Serpentis. This description presents many problems
 of interpretation that may depend on the particular pictorial guide used by Newton. The terminus at the

 stars in the middle stars of Sagitta may be a misstatement for two small stars above the middle of Sagittae
 since Flamsteed indicated that the tail extended a little beyond the middle. Moreover, Newton's coordinates

 are roughly consistent with certain largely un-cataloged "unformed" stars above the middle of Sagitta,
 particularly as depicted on Bayer's map, or as he might have identified himself. After further revisions,
 Newton indicated the end of the tail although not well defined extended above the middle of Sagittae to
 at least & 4° with north latitude of about 42 1/2 or 43 (CUL MS Add. 4004, f. 99r). Few constellations

 showed more differences of artistic depiction than the intertwined combination of Aquila and Antinous.
 The brightest star in the foot of Antinous (λ Aql) was surrounded by several smaller stars which were

 portrayed variously in the foot or just outside. Tycho catalogued one star in the foot and one just outside.

 Bayer presents a better option with two small stars just above λ Aql in the foot. The overlapping nature of
 the two constellations in Bayer's depiction, however, would lead to both the knee of Antinous and the bend

 in the wing of Aquila being identified as ft Aql. Newton's only unambiguous designation is the star in the
 end of the serpent's tail (Θ Ser).

 the draft of April 12 to / 19° 1/2 at an inclination of 53°. The actual letter of April

 16 finally put the inclination at 52° after initially writing 53°.

 The expected latitudes of the tail termini follow simply from a basic relation in

 a spherical right triangle: tangent of the latitude = sine of elongation from the node
 χ tangent of the inclination of the great circle at the node. Table 1 shows results for
 calculations at these various inclinations.

 The results most nearly fit a great circle if it cut the ecliptic in/ 19° 1/2 atanangleof

 about 53° or a little less. The final choice of an inclination of 52° may have been based

 on recognition that the actual envelope traced was not an exact great circle. Despite
 these variations, the Waste Book data for tail termini with only a couple of minor
 changes were listed in the Principia through all of its editions (1687, p. 497; 1713,
 pp. 455-456; 1999, pp. 917-918). A curious defect was the longitude for December

 24° in the first and second edition of the Principia.lt was finally corrected to Τ 24° in
 the third edition (Newton 1972, p. 735). Newton's failure to include any information
 about a prospective great circle envelope in the Principia and the inattention to the
 faulty zodiac sign indicate a loss of interest in a harmonic law of tails.

 12 Evaluating the observations

 Flamsteed's fourth letter of March 7 included a revised set of his Greenwich obser

 vations. The two most important changes from the set sent in February were new
 coordinates for the observation for December 12 that Newton had questioned and

 differences for January 10 that may have resulted from a copying error. In a charac

 teristic move, Newton calculated the distances between observations finding several

 discrepancies and ended by transcribing Flamsteed's set of observations sent February

 12 in the Waste Book in preference to the March revisions.51 Newton's response in

 51 CUL Add MS 4004, f. 98v. Newton copied a few remaining details from Flamsteed's letter of February
 12 onto a blank sheet of Flamsteed's March 7 letter. The full letter vanished as having nothing else of
 interest to him.

 April (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 365) indicated Flamsteed's January 10 longitude of
 Τ 20°49' I /2 in the "former" copy agreed better with the other observations than
 the longitude of Τ 20°42' in the copy last sent in March. It is not clear what basis
 Newton had for the determination. The technique of Problem 16, whether interpolated

 from positions on January 5, 9, and 13, or extrapolated from positions on December

 30, January 5 and 9, actually confirm a position on January 10 of about Ύ1 20°41' or
 20°42' consistent with the March revisions. It is noteworthy that Newton subsequently

 altered the Waste Book entry from Τ 20°49' 1/2 to 20°41' 1/2 with a heavy numeral

 1 nearly obliterating the 9.

 Taking Greenwich data adjusted to the same time as the standard, Newton also

 determined the corrections needed in the Parisian set received in February. Newton's
 results were added to the corresponding table in the Waste Book and cited in his
 draft of April 12 and letter of April 16. The greatest differences were January 8
 (T or 8') and January 13 (12'). Newton's calculations are lost or unidentified, but the
 method of Problem 16 yields results that agree quite well with Newton's results. He
 offered his observation of January 11 as a possible aid in resolving the differences.
 The same interpolation technique yields an hourly motion on January 11 of 4.4' in

 substantial agreement with Newton's silently adopted 9' parameter that represented

 2 h of motion. It is not clear how 9 p.m. arose over against 9:20 for the time the comet
 was supposedly observed to have the same altitude as sigma Pisces. Even though he

 juggled the results Newton claimed his measurements were accurate within a minute or
 two. All that would be needed for the 11th were accurate coordinates of sigma Pisces

 when the comet was quite close to the star. The failure to offer details of his own
 observations of January 6,8,9, and 10 indicate Newton believed they contained errors
 greater than several arc-minutes. Newton specifically mentioned the limitations of his
 early instruments. There was no hint of happier times when Newton used Tycho's
 observations to obtain reductions used in several applications. Manifestly, Newton
 had become disillusioned with his (pre micrometer) observations and available star
 catalogs.

 Newton envisioned better coordinates for sigma Pisces would be available in a
 month or two. Was it an expectation based on reduction of newly available raw data in

 Hevelius ( 1679)? If not, who was in the position to make a better observation? Newton

 questioned the necessity for Flamsteed to make the determination just to resolve the

 slight difference with the Parisian observations. No matter, if my sequencing is right,

 nothing more was heard of sigma Pisces or Newton's observations of December and

 January. As noted, Newton claimed he had not reduced the micrometer observations

 because he did not have the coordinates for the reference stars but he sought no help

 from Flamsteed. Indeed any such items or requests that might have served to prolong

 the correspondence were excluded from Newton's final letter.

 13 Newton's revised trajectory

 Twice in unsent drafts Newton alluded to a direct method to determine a comet's line

 of motion whatever it might be, adding in the second draft that the line could be deter

 mined almost as exactly as a planet's orbit, provided very accurate observations were

 available (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 362, 366). Newton had devised the micrometer
 for his telescope around February 10 for that very purpose. At that time Newton was

 relying on the rectilinear method and had complete observations only up to January
 24. He had limited information of the November comet gleaned from observers at
 Cambridge but had not yet received any November observations from the continent, at

 least from Flamsteed, or any later data that called for a revision of the initial rectilinear

 path. Newton's crude observations at the end of January and early February might have

 indicated some reorientation of the original trajectory would be required but Newton

 would have had no reason to suspect that radical changes would be needed. Thus, like
 Hooke (and Huygens), the method Newton had in mind in early February must have

 started with a rectilinear approximation to be fitted to further observations.52

 Newton's original rectilinear solution was based on observations up to January 11.
 Given the considerable amount of new data received by March 1680/1681 he set out
 to reevaluate the solution. Newton claimed that he had determined a new trajectory
 without any calculation, that is to say, without application of techniques in Problem
 52, but only by a general survey of the Greenwich and Paris observations (Newton
 1959-1977, 2, pp. 362, 366-367). The heliocentric parameters for Newton's revised
 trajectory are shown in Table 2.

 Newton obviously also surveyed his own observations. A plot on a globe or map
 (adjusted for precession) would have yielded the approximate coordinates. Worked in
 reverse the heliocentric position on March 9 taken as 4 a.u. from the sun in the plane
 of the ecliptic indicates Newton was using an observation, rounded to the nearest half
 degree, of about Π 0°30', 11°30'N with an elongation from the sun of about 60° 30'.53
 Perhaps, Newton found the original rectilinear path projected to March 9 would have
 yielded an elongation of only about 56°. One way or another Newton realized he had
 to modify that original solution. Newton could have chosen to change the direction or

 allow variation in speed. He decided to keep the speed constant and chart a path in a
 different direction.

 The Paris observations in hand covered the period from December 19 to January 13

 and served only as a crosscheck of other data (see above). The Greenwich observations

 extended to February 5 but for purposes of remapping the trajectory the only significant

 52 Halley indicated in a letter to Flamsteed from Paris dated January 22,1680/1681 that the nearest hypoth

 esis for the second comet was that it moved nearly in a line that crossed the ecliptic a great distance beyond

 the sun at an angle of about 13° and passed over the sun in the direction of 25° Π Halley found the line
 would have been straight only if the speed was allowed to change (Newton 1959-1977,2, p. 339).

 53 In 1685 the coordinates for March 9 proved to be II 0°43'2", 11°44' 3/5 N.

 change was Flamsteed's revised position for December 12 which fell at its expected
 position on the original rectilinear solution. The revision was important since it added

 support to Newton's belief that the comet was beyond the sun on that date because the

 tail of the comet was narrow, becoming wider on later dates.54 He had taken this nar
 rowness as evidence the tail was pointing away from us, which given their anti-solar

 nature placed the comet beyond the sun. Newton took the subsequent broadening of
 the tail as evidence the comet was closer than the sun with the tail pointing toward

 us. By considering Newton's parameters for perihelion it appears that he took Flam
 steed's revised position, or one very close to it, to establish heliocentric coordinates
 on December 12 about M 4°, 0.183 a.u. from the sun and 1.049 a.u. from the earth.

 The details of Newton's procedure are lost. The following analysis replicates New

 ton's numbers in Table 2 but is conjectural. The parameters can vary by almost one
 degree without changing the results viewed as round numbers. The heliocentric posi
 tion of the comet on December 12 as confirmed by Flamsteed's revised observation
 established one position. The comet's place on March 9 based on Newton's observa

 tion established the elongation from the sun. Maintaining the original rectilinear speed

 yields a distance in the plane of the ecliptic of about 4.1 a.u. between December 12 and
 March 9 (87.156 days at 0.0471 a.u./day). Triangulation establishes the heliocentric
 coordinates on March 9 at □ 13°'4, 12° Vi Ν, 4.2 a.u. from the sun. The trajectory
 crosses the sphere of the earth's mean path on January 2 around 2 a.m. at about □ 9°,

 19° '/2N. The result, however, departs sufficiently from the original rectilinear solution

 so that the path no longer satisfies the requirement of uniform speed for the actual

 observations in December and January. Somewhat better results for these intermedi

 ate positions might have been attained if Newton had drawn a slightly curved path
 that crossed the earth's orbit at a heliocentric longitude of about M 5°, although that
 position would have introduced other problems. Newton was prepared to introduce
 slight curvature to account for earlier observations.

 The revised trajectory between December 12 and March 9 projected back to the

 ecliptic placed the comet in the evening sky on November 24 with an ascending node
 about 0.89 a.u. from the sun at a geocentric longitude of about / 19°, while according
 to Halley's observation the comet was in the morning sky as late as December 8. Using

 what he called the analogy of its motion with the following observations, that is to say

 maintaining the same speed, Newton satisfied this requirement by extending the path

 along a line slightly concave to the sun (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 362, 367). This

 revised solution, made according to Newton without calculation, placed the heliocen

 tric position of the ascending node in / 20° on December 3, or December4 at the latest,

 at a distance slightly less than half as far beyond the sun as the sun is from the earth.55

 54 Newton's notes from various observers indicated: December 10, a small tail (Newton 1959-1977, 2,

 p. 315); December 11, the tail was broader than the moon (ibid., 2,352); December 15, the tail was broader
 than the moon (ibid., 2, p. 315); Dec 16, 2° wide (CUL MS 4004, f. 99r); December 17, the tail was
 broader than 2° (ibid.)·, December 21,2° wide (ibid.y, December 23, the tail was wider than before (ibid.y,
 December 28, the tail was wider than before (ibid., f. 99v); December 30 the tail was 1 ? 36' wide near the

 head widening to 4° at the end (ibid.y, on January 4 the tail was 1° 15' wide near the head widening to 3° Vt
 at the end (ibid., f. lOOr). Newton's Waste Book entry for December 12 does not include width.

 55 Newton (1959-1977, 2, pp. 362, 367) originally wrote 3/5 and changed it to 1/5, an obvious slip
 for Ά.

 The snare of simplicity: the Newton-Flamsteed correspondence revisited 441

 Newton did not explain how he reached this conclusion without calculation but
 several simple considerations would have sufficed. A separate entry related to his work
 on the law of tails, discussed above, indicated the apparent path of the trajectory cut
 the ecliptic in / 21° (CUL MS Add. 4004, f. lOlv). Given his use of a celestial globe
 Newton might have positioned Flamsteed's observations (adjusted for precession) for
 December 12 and 21 (those closest to the ecliptic), rotated the globe to a fixed great
 circle ring and noted the position at the ecliptic.56 According to Halley's observation
 in the morning of December 8 the comet was not yet in conjunction with the sun
 but from the position of the tail it was already north of the ecliptic. Given / 21° as
 Newton's estimate of the geocentric longitude of the node, the comet would already

 have been in conjunction with the sun December 2 at about 2 a.m., contrary to Halley's
 observation. Any time between December 2 and December 8 would have satisfied the

 general requirement under conditions of increasing curvature concave to the sun. If the

 time the comet crossed the ecliptic at an apparent longitude of / 21 ° was arbitrarily set
 about one day later on December 3,0:01 a.m. the least possible curvature would have
 been introduced with the comet at a heliocentric longitude of about / 19° 2/3, 0.47
 a.u. from the sun in agreement with Newton's stated values taken as round numbers.

 This approach would explain Newton's willingness to concede a date of December 4,

 but no later. After that date the curvature would have become totally unacceptable to

 Newton (see Fig. 2). The comet's position on December 3 marks the place where the

 comet would have crossed the ecliptic assuming its apparent position was about / 21 °.
 One day earlier in the region marked X would have placed the comet in conjunction
 with the sun and later dates would have increased the curvature substantially. The
 difficulty is the projected place of the comet on December 8 in the morning falls on
 a position east of the sun where it would have been visible only in the evening. Not

 only does Newton's solution beyond perihelion fail to account for observations in late

 December and January, but the portion before perihelion has insufficient curvature to
 account for Hallev's observation.

 Newton must not have inspected the proposed results very carefully, certainly not
 with the detail to which he subjected Flamsteed's scheme. Newton's approach was at

 best a highly simplified approach to the method he had in mind for accurately defining

 a path of motion. Obviously pressed for time and eager to cut off correspondence with

 Flamsteed and get on with other work, Newton used various expedients using only the

 first and last available observed positions and a nodal position selected to minimize the

 curvature. While he had a very good fix on the comet's last positions, he lacked their
 precise reduction and only sketchy information about the comet in early December.
 Recalculation using the techniques of Problem 52 would have been wasted effort
 which would have been subject to further modification as better information became
 available. As it was, Newton's solution for the curved segment before December 12

 raises serious questions concerning his assertions about the true length of the tail.

 56 Calculations using available observations for December 12 and 21 available to Newton would have
 placed the node in / 21°43'. Flamsteed's calculations using slightly different data placed the node in /
 21°46'2/3. Flamsteed found the values varied with different pairs of observations (Forbes 1975, pp. 28,
 109).

 Fig. 2 Comet of 1680 reconstruction of Newton's revised path (April 1681)

 14 A closer look at the length of the tail

 Flamsteed had been reluctant to allow the comet to pass around the sun not only because

 it seemed to require excessive speed but perhaps more importantly that passage coupled

 with the apparent length of the tail pointing away from the sun entailed an enormous
 actual length, particularly on December 8 and 10. Newton's response was true in a
 narrow sense but more broadly disingenuous. In the undated draft, although wishing he

 knew the apparent length when Halley observed it on 8 December, Newton found that
 from 10 December onward the tail reached well beyond the sphere of Mars (Newton
 1959-1977, 2, p. 361). In the actual letter, Newton asserted the tail extended beyond

 the sphere of Mars during the entire appearance of the comet and more particularly that

 the apparent length of the tail during December was not enormous but in agreement

 with the law it observed all that month (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 363).

 The true length would have been estimated by triangulation of the geocentric and

 heliocentric coordinates of the revised trajectory under the assumption the sun, head

 and tail of the comet lay in a straight line. Here the problem arises. The speed and

 heliocentric position of the comet on December 12 used to map the path in accordance

 with Newton's description put the positions on December 10 and 11 in unfavorable
 positions leading, as Flamsteed's feared, to unlikely tail lengths (see Table 3). The

 second column represents the distance from the sun to the end of the tail, the third

 column allows for the approximate distance of the head of the comet from the sun.

 Any substantial increase in curvature of the path has the length of the tail on December

 10 approaching infinity. The termini certainly extend beyond the sphere of Mars but

 contradicted Newton's view the tail was formed by the force of solar light. The true

 length should not decrease as the comet approached the sun. Perhaps another analyst

 can find a better fit of the pieces, I have not.

 A different approach by Newton would have largely vindicated Flamsteed's con
 clusions. The raw observations of the tail were sketchy and subject to vagaries of sky

 condition and obscuration by the Milky Way. Newton assumed that accurate determina

 tions of the apparent tail lengths follow some regular harmonic pattern represented by

 a great circle. The next step might logically have assumed the true length also follows

 some regular pattern of growth and accordingly Newton could have found heliocen
 tric positions that yielded more reasonable lengths for December 12 and before. Apart

 from the requirement for the path to be nearly rectilinear, the main reason to place
 December 12 beyond the sun was the apparent narrowness of the tail which suggested

 but did not prove the tail was pointing away from the earth. Positions for December
 10, 11, and 12 close to what Flamsteed proposed would have yielded tails about 0.8
 a.u. long. Newton's casual and seemingly disingenuous handling of the data calling
 for a revised path and the associated treatment of the true tail lengths was in sharp
 contrast with the detailed effort Newton devoted to evaluating consistency between
 observations.

 15 Hooke's Cometa and the comet of 1664

 The Waste Book has a section at folios 103r-104ν entitled Ex Hookii Cometa edito ann

 1678 (From Hooke's Cometa published in 1678) but which in fact abruptly change
 to include notes from Hevelius (1665, 1666). Newton copied details of Hooke's two

 observations of the comet of 1677 (pp. 1-5) noting its position, the orientation and

 extent of the tail, and apparent sizes of the nucleus and surrounding coma. Newton

 skipped Hooke's discussion of theoretical issues such as the duration of comets, their

 motion, and the growth of their tails and the issue of observation quality. Newton
 would have agreed with Hooke on the need for accurate observations, on the use
 of Wren's method of defining a rectilinear path to determine parallax, and found in

 Hooke a precedent for allowing comets to follow a concave path about the sun with

 greater or lesser deflection depending on the speed and variable outside influences, but
 Newton made no notes or comments. Instead Newton picked up Hooke's discussion

 (pp. 21-22) of the discrepancies found between the observations of top astronomers

 such Hevelius, Gottiginies, and Petit. A major debate, which Newton followed at the
 time through reports in the Philosophical Transactions (ULC Add 3958(B) 1, ff. 9r
 12r), had occurred over the final observations of the comet of 1664 which was decided

 against Hevelius. At some point Newton added a marginal note on those details from

 the account in Hevelius ( 1665, p. 2 and Fig. C). The main text continued with Newton's

 terse summary of Hooke's argument (pp. 45-46) that the head must provide some light

 of its own because the central part of the tail closest to the head was brighter than the
 outer parts more accessible to solar rays. The issue was precisely what concerned
 Newton in his letter of 28 February. Since Newton's Cometa notes followed sections

 that could not have been written before late March, the question arises whether Newton

 was highlighting Hooke's idea as confirmation or, having already read Cometa, was
 just now making or copying more systematic notes. Whatever the case, Newton's
 notes abruptly shifted to a meticulous copy of Hooke's Figure 4 depicting the comet's

 apparent trajectory according to various observers. An adjacent table of Tycho's star
 coordinates updated to 1664 is from Hevelius (1666, p. 128). The text continued with
 detailed comparisons between Hooke's observations of the comet of 1664 and those
 of Hevelius, Petit, and other observers listed in Hevelius (1666, pp. 133, 153, 155). A
 variant version of these details is on the "crazy quilt" document (3965.14, f. 616r).
 Newton continued with a table of 1664 observations Hevelius (1665, Table B,

 pp. 97-104), annotated by Newton as to relative quality, with a subset selected for
 determining a rectilinear trajectory. Newton's "Cometa notes" concluded with further

 details extracted from Hevelius (1665, pp. 2, 8-11, 16).

 The select observations were put to work in two unfinished error-ridden documents

 (CUL MS d. 3965.11, ff. 154r-155v) using the methods of Problem 52 and Wing's
 solar theory.57 Newton's first calculations were made on the verso of a letter draft
 to a Mr. Todd with some latter calculations made on the margins and more or less
 empty spaces of the draft.58 It is most plausible the calculations date from March or

 April 1680/1681, although a date in early winter 1684/5 may be possible shortly before
 Newton adopted Flamsteed's solar theory (CUL MS Add. 3965.5, f. 21 ; Ruffner 2012,

 16 On fetching a curve

 Newton argued in his letter of February 28 if only one comet had appeared it would have

 been continually attracted to the sun and made to fetch a curve around it. Flamsteed's

 57 Newton indexed the initial page of Wing's solar tables which were based on London time on the flyleaf
 of his copy of Wing (1669) preserved in the Trinity College Library NQ. 18.36. He converted the times
 of observation to London time using an erroneous time difference between Gedani (Gedansk) and London
 of 36'. Wing (1669, tables, p. 69) listed the difference between Dantzig (using the alternative name) and
 London as I h 14' or 1 h 16'. Philosophical Transactions # 129 ( 1676, p. 724) lists the difference between
 Dantzig and Greenwich as 1 h 14'45",also found in an annotation onaflyleafofNewton'scopyofMercator
 (1676), Trinity NQ. 10.152. Perhaps Newton confused Gedani with another place but I have not found one
 with a time difference of 36'.

 The snare of simplicity: the Newton-Flamsteed correspondence revisited 445

 response of March 7 reiterated his attraction/repulsion model. Flamsteed admitted that

 a passage around the sun would facilitate the inclination and bending of the comet's
 lines of ingress and egress but required too great an increase in speed. Flamsteed
 enclosed a carefully delineated path reduced to the ecliptic drawn to scale. Alternative
 turns both short of the sun and beyond were included. Yet Flamsteed indicated he
 still had problems (Newton 1959-1977, pp. 351-352). Since tails point away from
 the sun, the apparent lengths observed on December 8 and 10 required such great
 actual lengths as to be unlikely. Flamsteed asked Newton for assistance, indicating he

 not yet resolved the difficulties. Before Newton could respond, however, in a letter to

 Townely dated 22 March 1681 Flamsteed adopted a turn around the sun as if there had

 never been any doubt (Flamsteed 1995-2002, 1, pp. 780-784). Had Newton's initial
 arguments finally convinced Flamsteed?

 Newton did not know Flamsteed changed his mind and tried to formulate sugges
 tions that would correct Flamsteed's errors and resolve the dilemma. Newton's labored

 response to Flamsteed required an undated draft, a second draft of April 12, and the

 letter dated April 16, 1681. Newton's responses to the issue of the true length of the
 tail have already been discussed. Additionally, the undated draft offered a careful cri

 tique of the flaws in Flamsteed's reasoning when analyzing the apparent motions of
 November and December. Newton augmented his objections to Flamsteed's notion
 that the body of the comet was magnetized and that its line of polarization remained

 fixed in space. Newton also expanded the difficulties raised earlier for the notion that

 the sun's magnet first attracts and then repulses the body whether it is swept around it
 or not. Then in a famous passage Newton suggested Flamsteed could avoid all these
 difficulties by supposing the sun's alleged magnetism continually attracted the comet

 and "made to fetch a compass about the sun" where the vis centrifuga at perihelion

 would overpower the attraction and force the comet to begin to recede from the sun
 (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 361). The proposed mechanism was quite different from
 that developed by Newton in 1684 and was based on an idea of Giovanni-Alfonso
 Borelli which looking backward had figured in Newton's recent dispute with Hooke
 (Whiteside 1970, p. 13). For his part, however, Newton went on in the next two con

 cluding paragraphs to offer parameters about the extent of the tail and the comet's path

 based on the assumption of uniform motion in a line that was very nearly straight, not
 one that had fetched a path about the sun.

 Various commentators ignoring the final paragraphs suggest the statement on fetch

 ing a curve reflected Newton's actual thoughts at the moment. They variously imagine

 Newton was reconsidering magnetism as the motive force, entertaining the possibility

 the two comets were one and the same moving in accord with planetary laws, tak

 ing a step toward his mature cosmological theory, simply toying with a parabola, or
 envisioning an actual orbit (Kollerstrom 1999, p. 340; Wilson 1969, p. 155; Schech
 ner 1997, p. 136; Hughes 1988, p. 58; Christianson 1984, p. 277; Nauenberg 1994,
 p. 252). It is more reasonable to assume that Newton was still outlining changes Flam
 steed needed to make before publication without prejudice to Newton's views that

 underlie the rest of the document. This proposed "fetching" was followed in the next

 stretch of the imagination joined the November comet. Newton (Newton (1959-1977),

 2, pp. 364-365) continued most importantly with arguments against the comet having
 "fetched a curve" about the sun.

 446 J. A. Ruffner

 The subsequent draft of April 12 included another famous argument omitted from

 the letter of April 16. Flamsteed had been hesitant to allow the November comet
 to move past the sun. Newton argued it is against the nature of the thing for the
 comet to turn short of him. In a curious but revealing twist Newton then noted that

 his telescope was fitted with a micrometer because he thought he had a method to

 determine the comet's line of motion, whatever it might be, almost as accurately as the

 orbits of planets, but needed very exact observations. The idea had germinated in early

 February after having resolved the initial rectilinear path based on Wren's hypothesis.

 In space free of all forces such a path would result. In Newton's vortex filled world

 such a hypothesis if not strictly true would place appropriate limits on the motion of a

 comet which could be corrected after the fact by accurate observations comparable to

 those available for planets. In which case Newton was arguing not only was it against

 the nature of a comet to turn short of the sun but it was also against their nature to

 make any sharp turn at all and instead that they continue nearly in a straight line unless

 very strong forces were invoked. It is highly unlikely, as has been conjectured, that this

 juxtaposition of paths in ingress and egress with an untried method indicate Newton
 was still assuming the appearances were one and the same and the comet had indeed

 fetched a path about the sun (Wilson 1969, p. 154; Wilson 1989, p. 149; Hughes 1988,
 p. 58). Newton more likely believed that the November passage would prove to be
 slightly curved as it continued southward past the sun into the depths of space just as

 with his preliminary work on the "posterior" comet had shown it emerging northward
 from those depths. On the issue of determining the line whatever it might be, rather
 than assuming Newton was thinking of any possible bent line such as a parabola, it

 could easily be the case he was thinking of a uniform line of motion with any possible
 speed and direction consistent with the title of Problem 52. The need to add slight
 curvature to such a solution did not change Newton's expectation. There was no need
 for Newton to suddenly imagine attraction by the sun because flow across the solar

 vortex could readily account for, if not exactly predict, any slight deflection. Such a
 view was consistent with ideas expressed by both Hooke and Hevelius.

 In the undated draft, Newton was prepared to offer a plausible mechanism under

 which a comet could "fetch a curve around the sun" to aid a confrere in offering a

 contrary view. Such suggestions however would have invited further correspondence

 and were dropped in the April 12 draft and the final letter where Newton developed

 empirical reasons why the comet did not make a sharp turn either short of or beyond

 the comet. Newton's argument hung on the credibility of the time and date for the
 ascending node discussed above but for which he offered no evidence. If that were

 doubted, Newton's clinching argument asserted a single comet hypothesis is paradox
 ical because it would have gone in a bent curve such as had never before been observed

 (Newton 1959-1977,2, p. 364). Newton argued comets seen to move across the entire
 sky according to historic reports could not have done so unless their actual line of

 motion was nearly straight. Newton's prime counterexample was the comet of 1664.

 Thus, despite an earlier willingness to let Flamsteed publish contrary views, Newton
 now insisted such a turn was contrary to the phenomena.

 The snare of simplicity: the Newton-Flamsteed correspondence revisited 447

 17 An unresolved ending

 Newton had a well formulated research program at the end of February and reason to

 believe he had developed convincing arguments against Flamsteed's approach. Many

 of Newton's requests for information were answered in Flamsteed's last letter of March
 7 which also showed an unconvinced Flamsteed seeking further assistance. The new

 data enabled Newton to work on a law of tails and a revised path for the posterior comet

 of 1680. Working at a feverish pace, Newton also devoted considerable effort to help
 Flamsteed develop a more plausible theory before deciding Flamsteed was simply
 wrong. Since Newton did not receive the letter until nearly the end of March Newton

 devoted little more than 2 weeks for all this additional work including quite possibly the

 study of Hooke's Cometa and an associated attempt to determine a rectilinear path for

 the comet of 1664. Newton's failure was in placing too much trust in simple procedures

 to produce results that provided no more than rough estimates and varied according to
 the data selected. Newton can be credited for cogent criticism of particular details in

 Flamsteed's theory, if only he had done the same thing for his own work. Newton can
 also be credited for the realization that closer attention was needed to observations in

 early December, particular that by Halley of which only sketchy details were available
 in 1681.

 Newton had been content to allow a valued colleague to argue hypothetically that
 the sun attracted a comet given a plausible mechanism which Newton drafted. But
 in the end Newton was convinced such a mechanism was not applicable to a comet.
 Newton's evidence to the contrary was based on the time and place the comet crossed

 the ecliptic in December, the length of the tail in early December, and the testimony

 of the historical record. The first point could have been readily refuted by Flamsteed if
 Newton had revealed the method, at least as I have analyzed it. Newton probably was

 never made aware of Flamsteed's analysis showing significant variation in the position

 of the node with different pairs of observation especially near the ascending node, and
 Newton seems to have adhered to the principle that the comet followed an apparent

 great circle path very nearly except near the end of visibility. Even if the node position
 were accepted, the date the comet crossed the ecliptic depended on allowing no more
 than the minimum amount of curvature. Curvature closer to Flamsteed's proposal
 would have established a date more consistent with Halley's observation. Moreover,

 Newton's analysis of the tail length in early December if fully exposed would have
 vindicated Flamsteed's analysis. Newton's claim about comets seen to traverse the
 full arc of the sky ignored the accidents of perspective when comets pass close to the

 earth. As for the particular claim for the comet of 1664, a rectilinear solution placing

 the comet outside the earth's orbit adjusted to account for observations before or after

 positions chosen for analysis would have introduced curvature little less than that

 found in planets traversing the region over the same time interval.

 Newton's reluctance to proceed further in April 1681 could have been part of a

 newly acquired distaste for existing catalogs or simply a desire to get back to work

 that had been interrupted and not to get further involved with disputations as recently

 with Hooke. By early May 1681, Newton had results from revived work in chemistry
 (CUL MS Add. 3975, ff. 121-122). Although he left off his study of comets with

 problematic responses to Flamsteed, Newton certainly had accomplished enough with

 simple propositions to confute Descartes, if that had been an objective-an objective
 Newton would take up again in System of the World. For his part, Flamsteed gave
 no heed to Newton's critique beyond the sly adoption of a turn around the sun as if

 there had never been any doubt. Otherwise, views little different from those properly

 criticized by Newton occupied a central place in Flamsteed's lecture on 11 May 1681 at

 Gresham College. Moreover, as shown in his letter to Newton of 5 January 1684/1685,

 Flamsteed did not budge from a belief the sun was the most powerful magnet in the
 solar system (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 409).

 It is evident from the discussion that Newton hewed to the principles espoused

 by Streete (1651) as noted above. The making and collection of observations from
 around the world is seen to be an equally important component of Newton's research.

 It is ironic that he allowed his predilection for straightness to ignore much of the
 observational material when he posited his final comments in April 1681 about the

 path of the comet and the length of the tail. It may have been the inevitable consequence

 of Newton's disillusionment about the accuracy of Tycho's star coordinates.

 Newton had started with high hopes about his ability to determine the comet's

 positions amongst the stars using a single set of alignments with two or more stars.59

 He was sufficiently satisfied with these results reduced using Tycho's star catalog to

 combine them with observations made by Flamsteed in order to determine a rectilinear

 path amongst the planets. A desire to obtain more accurate positions led to the devel
 opment of what he later would admit was a crude micrometer. Still needed would
 be a system to convert the micrometer readings to arc distances and to obtain star
 positions more accurate than those determined by Tycho. At the same time Newton

 had come to appreciate the quality of Flamsteed's observations, using them to gauge
 the accuracy of Cassini's observations, and urged Flamsteed to resume observations
 that would have overlapped Newton's micrometer aided work. Rather oddly, perhaps
 because he found the raw micrometer data more difficult to work with than he had

 imagined, Newton did not press Flamsteed for better star coordinates as he would do
 in 1684 and 1685. Flamsteed's observations and those based on Newton's micrometer,

 with at least two later revisions using more accurate star positions from Flamsteed,
 dominated all of Newton's subsequent work.

 Newton's predilections led him to reject one of Flamsteed's key arguments by
 which observations made of the November comet showed it moving southward across

 the ecliptic and then due to solar attraction it was seen to move northward. Granting

 no such phenomenon, Newton rejected those observations due to scatter in favor of

 a crude reconstruction of casual local observations that placed the November comet
 on a continuous southward path uninfluenced by the sun. He did not throw them
 away or cross them out of the Waste Book. The November observations and those

 beginning in December had lives of their own, apart from any particular principles of
 motion. The parabolic approximation devised by Newton (1686, p. 494) and revised
 by Halley (Newton 1713, p. 458) were based on Flamsteed's observations. Newton's

 later micrometer based observations served to confirm the solution for that part of the
 path. Lacking better data, Newton combined various sets of November observations

 59 Contrast this approach with observations at elaborate fully staffed observatories headed by expert
 astronomers such as Tycho, Cassini, Flamsteed, Hevelius, and others who made repeated measurements.

 received in time from around the world to determine some sort of "average" positions

 in order to confirm the fit of the solution for that part of the trajectory (Newton 1686,
 p. 496; 1713, p. 463).60 The proposed ellipse in the third edition (Newton 1999,
 p. 912) excluded these "average" positions in favor of a single set of observations,
 discovered long after the fact, made in Saxony earlier in November by Gottfried
 Kirch.

 No Baconian, Newton posited several important generalizations for which he found

 only a few scattered examples. Based on reports of 24 prominent comets observed since

 1530, Newton found some four examples supporting a principle that comets follow
 great circle paths except near the end of visibility. The principle in turn justified
 extrapolations of positions close to the sun in an unobserved part of the trajectory.
 Newton's generalization that the tail bends back towards the parts it left behind was
 supported by observations of the comet of 1680 and perhaps two earlier examples.

 The phenomenon was readily explicable at first by the drag of the vortex, and by an
 entirely different mechanism later (Newton 1686, pp. 501-502; 1999, pp. 921-922).
 In short, Newton's selection and characterization of phenomena often depended on
 observations guided by theoretical concepts.

 18 Aftermath

 For Newton, two critical factors were missing in April 1681, the length of the tail as

 observed by Halley on December 8 and a reduction of his observations in February and

 March. The former was needed to provide a more definitive guide about the phenomena

 of early December, the latter to define the path toward the end of visibility. Newton

 must have taken the opportunity to question Halley during one of their meetings in

 1684 to obtain the account of that observation found in the Waste Book along with a

 report of Richer's pendulum experiments recently made available. Almost as quickly
 Newton was back at work on the micrometer data seeking Flamsteed's help (Newton
 1959-1977, 2, pp. 403-407).

 Newton operated from a strong sense of universality in 1680/1681 as shown by
 his opposition to Flamsteed's ideas that contradicted conditions experienced at first
 hand on earth. That does not mean Newton had a belief in universal gravitation any
 more than magnetism operated universally between all types of matter. A change of
 attitude occurred around the end of 1683 or the beginning of 1684 that boil down in
 the mass of documents related to Theologiae gentiles origines philosopicae (Philo
 sophical origins of gentile theology) to one important summary in Yahuda Newton

 MS 17.2, ff. 18r-19r (Schaffer 1993; Iliffe 1995). Ancient knowledge of the true sys
 tem of the world became degraded through the use of mystical expressions, alle
 gories, and false teaching. Ancient beliefs that the stars are worlds composed of
 the same matter as the earth and comets are a type of planet pointed to a concept

 of universal gravitation. At the same time Newton might have come to doubt the

 60 The process would have involved adjusting observations for time differences and hourly rates of change
 and comparing them among themselves. This comparison probably included averages where several values

 were involved with some sort of smoothing of the results.

 empirical evidence that led him to drop the proposed mechanism once intended for
 Flamsteed's benefit. Had Newton already decided on gravity's universality and went

 searching for justification in antiquity or did he come to realize it as he pondered the
 ancient texts for other purposes? Either way, Halley's fateful encounter with him in
 fall 1684 met a Newton prepared to tackle one of the great unsolved mysteries. Plan

 etary motion had already been solved, if he could only find the paper. The remaining

 mystery was the motion of comets. That would help explain why comets were intro
 duced in the de Motu tracts with the intent of settling ongoing disputes about their
 paths and why immediate queries with Flamsteed in December 1684 and January
 1684/5 showed equal intention to determining paths of the comets of 1664 & 1680
 according to the principles planetary motion as to get to the bottom of the influence
 of planets upon each other (Newton 1959-1977, 2, p. 413). By 1684, comets had
 become fully gravitational objects and were central for developing the new cosmol
 ogy. Hence Newton's triumphal two page foldout diagram when the issue was finally
 resolved.

 The propositions added to the Ubservationes & Scoha document torm an outline tor

 a comprehensive treatment document on comets and begin to articulate the transition
 (Ruffner 2000). The exact placement in the sequence between Philosophical origins,
 the various De motu tracts, and Liber Secundus is open to further discussion. But they

 could plausibly be dated as late as the middle of 1685 as a draft of ideas that would
 be further developed in Liber Secundus as part of a popular System of the World.
 Propositions placing comets above the moon and invoking the heliocentric system
 of Aristarchus as restored by Copernicus flowed out of the "Origins" documents of

 1683/1684 straight through to the "System" of 1685. The gravitational principles in
 the propositions were in general accord with those in De motu tracts with allowances
 for a more popular treatment and were far more sophisticated than the suppressed

 mechanism Newton had intended forFlamsteed in 1681. Placing the sun nearly in the
 focus suggests Newton may have been thinking of perturbations as first articulated
 in de Motu (in fluidis), CUL MS Add. 3965.5a, ff. 40-54, around December 1684.
 Perturbations may also have been in mind as he posited a proposition, for popular
 consumption, that the path of a comet orbit would be oval if it were periodic over
 against a non-periodic curve that would be nearly a hyperbola. A proposition dealing

 with the rate of growth of comet tails represented a dynamic approach entirely different

 from their behavior expressed in 1681. That behavior required that celestial material

 have no sensible resistance as first articulated in de Motu (in fluidis). The allusion to a

 vortex in the propositions was no bar to this period because an unused draft fragment

 of the "System" initially denied the possibility that comets travel along the edge of

 the vortex while a redraft later in the document indicated they do not travel inside the

 sphere of circumsolar force (CUL MS 3965.11, ff. 175r, 176v).

 Newton was working on a detailed account of comets in Winter 1680/1681 based on
 rectilinear principles before becoming engulfed in correspondence with Flamsteed.
 The key note was a list of memorable comets and associated phenomena selected as

 evidence that comets were close to the sun when visible to the naked eye in contrast
 to Descartes and others who placed them beyond the orbit of Saturn. Newton adhered
 steadfastly to uniform rectilinear motion for comets subject only to slight deflection
 as they cut transversely across the solar vortex. His attempt to develop a law of tails
 turned out to be a blind alley. Newton adduced cogent comments based on uniform

 action between earth and the heavens but the attempt to aid Flamsteed was flawed by
 the uncritical use of simple calculation techniques and dubious historical evidence.

 Armed with an entirely different view of the physics, Newton entered on a more fruitful

 track in 1684 that proved to be far more difficult than he dared to imagine. Once again

 he fashioned the comet sections of System of the World with evidence against Descartes

 and others who ignored the plain evidence before their eyes and placed comets either far

 beyond the planets or caged them below the moon. The technical content of System of

 the World and its underlying manuscripts as a prelude to Newton's ultimate resolution

 in the Principia await a far more detailed and quantified study than they have received
 in the wider universe of Newtonian scholarship.

 Appendix: Dating the Waste Book entries

 Newton's Waste Book has data entries for the comets of 1680 and 1682 (CUL Add

 4004, ff. 97r-105r).61 Incomplete entries for the micrometer readings based on an
 erroneous distance between two key reference stars are found at folio 97r. This entry
 probably dates from fall 1684 and was at issue in December 1684 when Newton
 sought corrections from Flamsteed. The first entries most likely were made around
 the end of March 1680/1681 starting at folio 98v, leaving several blank pages after
 the previous subject section. The November observations by Hill, Cellio, and Gallet
 (with correct dates) extracted from Flamsteed's letter of March 7 (received March 26)
 were listed first. Also listed was the scholar's observation as corrected in March. These

 data were followed by coordinates for the "subsequent" comet made at Paris and the
 "same" comet made at Greenwich beginning in December. On close examination the

 Greenwich data proves to be the version sent in February 1680/1681, with the addition

 of solar positions received in March. The longitude for January 10 was originally a
 now barely discernible Τ 20°49' Vi which according to Newton's April letter he
 preferred over Τ 20°42' listed in the revised set sent in March. Later Newton altered
 this position to Τ 20°41' Vi, more nearly in accord with the March version. The

 discrepancies between the Paris and Greenwich observations noted in the Waste Book

 tabulation were cited in Newton's April letter.

 The facing folio 99r continuing to folio lOlr provided corresponding information
 about the tail for the "prior" and "posterior" comets from all four of Flamsteed's
 letters, Flamsteed's "astrolabe," Newton's observations, with a marginal entry for

 I ignore the unused subject headings left by the previous owner of the notebook.

 observations from Scotland. This marginal entry continued with a partial listing of

 observations from Hamburg with the rest of the Hamburg information incorporated in

 chronological sequence of the main text. Descriptions provided by Cassini (1681) and
 Ponthio (1681) from Gallet and other Jesuit observers in France and Spain were not
 included. Those sources began to be used in 1685. Another indication of an original
 date of March 1680/1681 was the use of Tycho's coordinates for a certain star with
 68' added for precession. Newton had become generally dissatisfied by the time of
 his April correspondence by all available star catalogues and in 1685 was pressing
 Flamsteed for more accurate coordinates. The compilation of tail data culminated in

 folios 101r/v with a discussion about a law of tails. This material was essentially work

 in progress in late March 1680/1681 with variations found in other manuscripts and
 Newton's drafts and letter of April 1681. Nothing was heard of the law of tails later.

 The law of tails was followed in folio 101 ν with no obvious break or variation in

 handwriting by "what Halley told me" about his observation of December 8, 1680,
 information Newton wished for in April 1681. A close examination of the entry for
 December 8, 1680 in folio 99r reveals certain details from what Halley told him
 have been squeezed in with information that had come from Flamsteed in February

 1680/1681. Again with no obvious break or variation in handwriting the text in folio

 101 ν ended with an unrelated and incomplete note (in English) about Jean Richer's

 pendulum experiments at Cayenne (5° Ν latitude) in French Guiana. It is reasonable to

 suppose that the information attributed to Halley and Richer was an insertion following

 a meeting in fall 1684 when both comets and gravitation were in the forefront of
 Newton's thoughts.

 Rounding out the data for the posterior comet, folio 102r provided information
 about the appearance of the head gleaned from Flamsteed's letters, arguably entered
 in March 1680/1681. Folio 102ν is blank.

 Newton's entries on Folios 103r-104v consisted of notes from Hooke's Cometa and

 related material from Hevelius that led directly to Newton's attempted rectilinear cal
 culations for the comet of 1664 in CULMS Add. 3965.11, ff. 154r-155v. While the use

 of Wing's solar tables in the calculations suggest a date in 1680/1681, Newton might
 have used them for a while in 1684/5 before shifting to Flamsteed's solar theory.62
 Overall, the selections and omissions from Cometa and sequel mirrored concerns of
 Newton in 1680/1681. A different version of some of this material on the comet of

 1664 was added to the crazy quilt document (CUL MS Add. 3965.14, f. 616r).

 Newton followed on folio 105r with his observations of 1682 that were probably

 entered contemporaneously. A brief mathematical entry at folio 107r may have been

 in place by 1684 to block continuation of comet data. This arrangement would explain

 why the incomplete listing of micrometer corrections that likely date from fall 1684

 reverted to blank space on folio 97r left at the beginning of the section.

 Cassini ( 1681 ) was not available in England until about May 1681. As work revived
 in early 1685, Flamsteed urged Newton to consult it. Newton probably did not get

 around to it until late summer 1685 at which time he noted discrepancies with other

 62 Flamsteed's tables were used to calculate solar places corresponding to Ponthio's observations. These
 calculations are found on a sheet with early drafts of definitions for the original book I of the Principia.

 reports and requested clarification from Flamsteed (Newton 1959-1977, 2, pp. 419
 421). Newton squeezed additional observations from the book in the earlier table at

 folio 98v of Paris observations received via Flamsteed.63 Continuing, folio 98r which
 had been blank, Newton included coordinates for the November comet from Pon

 thio, Pierre Ango, Geminiano Montenaro, and ended with observations from Hevelius
 (1685).64

 The comet notes in the Waste Book almost certainly date in late March or early

 April with entries in 1682, 1684, and 1685 as noted.
