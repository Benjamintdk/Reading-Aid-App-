 Abstract The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive exposition of the early
 contributions to the so-called Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, Dynkin Theorem during
 the years 1890-1950. Related works by Schur, Poincaré, Pascal, Campbell, Baker,
 Hausdorff, and Dynkin will be investigated and compared. For a full recovery of the

 original sources, many mathematical details will also be furnished. In particular, we
 rediscover and comment on a series of five notable papers by Pascal (Lomb 1st Rend,
 1901-1902), which nowadays are almost forgotten.

 1 Introduction

 The algebraic result named after (some or all of) the mathematicians Henry Frederick
 Baker, John Edward Campbell, Eugene Borisovich Dynkin, and Felix Hausdorff is

 one of the most versatile results originating from the early theory of groups of trans-
 formations. This result states that, in the algebra of the formal power series in two
 non-commuting indeterminates x and y, the series naturally associated to logO*^)

 is a series of Lie polynomials in x and y' for instance, the first few terms are

 log(eV) = x + y + j[x,y] + jï[x, [x, )>]] - [j, [x, )>]] H

 During the whole twentieth century, this result (which, for convenience, we henceforth

 refer to as "CBHD," after its major contributors, or genetically as "the Exponential
 Theorem") has yielded the following applications:

 - to Physics , especially with the consolidation of Quantum and Statistical Mechan-

 ics - see the early applications from the 1960s and 1970s: Bialynicki-Birula et al.
 (1969), Dragt and Finn (1976), Eriksen (1968), Friedrichs (1953), Gilmore (1974),
 Kumar (1965), Mielnik and Plebanski (1970), Murray (1962), Suzuki (1977), Wei
 (1963), Weiss and Maradudin (1962), Wichmann (1961), and Wilcox (1967); see
 also the numerous recent papers in Physics journals related to CBHD: Blanes et
 al. (1998), Blanes et al. (2009), Bose (1989), Casas (2007), Casas and Murua
 (2009), Klarsfeld and Oteo (1989a), Klarsfeld and Oteo (1989b), Kobayashi et al.
 (1998), Kolsrud (1993), Moan (1988), Moan and Noteo (2001), Oteo (1991), and
 Reinsch (2000); and finally see the investigations concerning the relevant conver-
 gence and optimization problems: Blanes and Casas (2004), Day et al. (1991), Moan
 and Niesen (2008), Newman et al. (1989), Richtmyer and Greenspan (1965), and
 Thompson (1982, 1989);

 - to Group Theory : Magnus (1950), Magnus et al. (1966), and Michel (1976);
 - to the Analysis of Linear PDEs : See the seminal works from the 1970s and 1980s
 Folland (1975), Folland and Stein (1982), Hörmander (1967), Rothschild and Stein
 (1976), and Nagel et al. (1985);

 - to the structure theory of Lie Groups and Lie Algebras: Abbaspour and Moskowitz

 (2007), Bourbaki (1972), Duistermaat and Kolk (2000), Godement (1982), Gor-
 batsevich et al. (1997), Hall (2003), Hausner and Schwartz (1968), Hilgert and
 Neeb (1991), Hochschild (1965), Hofmann and Morris (2006), Jacobson (1962),
 Rossmann (2002), Sagle and Walde (1973), Sepanski (2007), Serre (1965), and
 Varadarajan (1984);

 - more recently, to Numerical Analysis (in geometric integration): Hairer et al. (2006),

 Iserles et al. (2000), Iserles and N0rsett (1999), and McLachlan and Quispel (2002).

 Furthermore, a special comment has to be made on the role played by the CBHD

 Theorem also within the context of infinite dimensional Lie groups, nowadays inten-
 sively studied; see Neeb (2006) for a detailed survey. For example, in this context, the
 so-called Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff groups are particularly significant: for related
 topics see Birkhoff (1936, 1938), Boseck et al. (1981), Czyz (1989, 1994), Dynkin
 (1950), Glöckner (2002a, b,c), Glöckner and Neeb (2003), Gordina (2005), Hilgert
 and Hofmann (1986), Hofmann (1972, 1975), Hofmann and Morris (2007), Hofmann
 and Neeb (2009), Neeb (2006), Omori (1997), Robart (1997, 2004), Schmid (2010),
 Van Est and Korthagen (1964), Vasilescu (1972), and Wojtynski (1998).

 Finally, the interest in providing new and simpler proofs of the CBHD Theorem

 seems to have been renewed throughout the century: see e.g., Yosida (1937), Cartier
 (1956), Eichler (1968), Djokovic (1975), Veldkamp (1980), and Tu (2004).

 As attention focussed more and more on the applications, and after the CBHD The-

 orem had become the well-consolidated result of non-commutative Algebra, critique

 of the early contributions lost its appeal. But this resulted, from the very beginning, in
 a very confused and uncertain attribution of the "fatherhood" of the theorem, which

 was named sometimes after Campbell, Baker, and Hausdorff, some other times after

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 297

 Campbell and Hausdorff, or also after Hausdorff solely. As we shall discuss in detail,

 the last two choices are very questionable and seem dictated mainly by tradition.

 Needless to say, the contributions given by the forerunners of the theorem, Ernesto

 Pascal, Jules Henri Poincaré, and Friedrich Heinrich Schur, have to a great extent been

 forgotten. This is definitely true of Pascal's and of Schur's contribution, whereas that

 by Poincaré luckily has been brought to light by Schmid (1982) after many years of

 oblivion (see also Ton-That and Tran 1999). We point out that the paper (Schmid 1982)

 also contains some salient points on the whole history of the Exponential Theorem, of

 which we took advantage in writing this paper. Yet, a full recovery of the prior results

 (of Pascal, Poincaré, and Schur) and a comparison of the actual contributions by the
 authors, whose names have been usually attached to the theorem (Baker, Campbell,

 Hausdorff, and Dynkin) have not been provided in the literature.1

 The aim of the present paper is to provide these missing investigations and com-

 parisons of the early contributions to the Exponential Theorem furnished by all the

 cited authors. In particular, we rediscover a long list of works by the Italian mathema-
 tician Pascal (1901a, b, 1902a, b,c, 1903), which had been of decisive importance for

 the history of this theorem.

 Since the original sources are not all easily accessible,2 and since not only the
 names of some contributors but also the contributions themselves have been lost, we

 discuss the mathematical details. In doing this, we hope that our article will be helpful

 to those who wish to rediscover the contents of the original papers (these papers being

 written in many different languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Russian).

 The paper is indeed intended for the specialists in the fields of applications mentioned

 in the incipit, who may find use for these mathematical contents, as well as for experts

 in the History of Mathematics. Even if this paper is based on the works of the early

 contributors to the Exponential Theorem, the analysis and comparison of these con-
 tributions are carried out here for the first time. Moreover, our intention is to ease the

 access to these papers by explaining their contents in modern language.

 The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the roots of the CBHD Theo-
 rem, as a result originating implicitly in Sophus Lie's theory of continuous groups of
 transformations. Subsequently, we analyze and compare the works of Schur, Camp-
 bell, Poincaré, Pascal, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin on the Exponential Theorem:
 this is done from Sect. 3 to Sect. 9. Section 10 records the commentaries by Bourbaki

 (1972) and by Hausdorff (1906) on the early contributions. As we shall see, the author-
 itative influence of Bourbaki and Hausdorff affected to a great extent the subsequent

 forgetting of the other authors' contributions.

 Without being exhaustive in this Introduction, we furnish a précis of some (less-

 known or maybe unknown) results presented in this paper.

 1 For example, Dieudonné (1982, Chapter BII, p. 189) quotes the names of Campbell, Dynkin, Hausdorff,
 Poincaré, and Schur (omitting Baker and Pascal) in a list of those who "contributed substantially" to the

 theory of Lie's groups. Curiously, the historically interested mathematicians, Borel (2001, Chapter I, p. 6)
 and Dieudonné (1974, Chapter XIX, p. 222), refer to the Exponential Theorem as the "Campbell-Hausdorff

 formula," still omitting any reference to Baker.

 1 This is particularly true for the Italian papers by Pascal (1901a,b, 1902a,b,c).

 298 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 (i) As Engel reveals to us in the review3 of Pascal (1901b), Sophus Lie himself

 embarked on the search for an explicit formula providing, for any pair of infin-
 itesimal transformations X', X2, the infinitesimal transformation X3 such that
 ex3 _ ex2 0 eXi ^ as Engel says> Lje abandoned the undertaking since he
 saw no way of proving the convergence of the series representing X3 in terms of

 X' , X2. It will be the contribution of Hausdorff (1906) to solve the convergence

 problem in a convincing way.

 (ii) In proving the Third Fundamental Theorem of Lie by a direct approach, Schur

 (1890a,b) constructed explicit infinitesimal transformations with prescribed
 structure constants with the use of some converging multivariate power

 series depending only on the Cijk and the Bernoulli numbers.4 Quoting Schmid
 (1982, p. 177), this is a version of the "Campbell-Hausdorff formula in dis-
 guise." In fact, a few years later, Pascal (1902c) will show how Schur's explicit
 formulas can be obtained by means of the Exponential Theorem, thus unveiling

 in an incontrovertible way the deep link between Schur's formulas and the future
 CBHD Theorem.

 (iii) As will be seen in due course, the summands in the expansion of 'og(exey)

 containing x precisely once are given by

 Zi (X, y) := X ^ (AdyTO =: (x), (1)

 n= 0

 where the Bn are the Bernoulli numbers. This series will play central roles in
 the proofs by Campbell, Pascal, Baker, and Hausdorff. The first one to intro-
 duce z' was Campbell (1897a), who explicitly employed this series to construct,
 recursively, a sequence approaching 'og(exey). Campbell's proof of the conver-
 gence of this sequence unfortunately leaves much unsaid, and his successors
 will acknowledge him only for having posed for the first time the problem of
 the existence of a universal Lie-polynomial series z in x, y such that ez = exey:

 the so-called Campbell's Problem. Campbell gives in nuce a contribution to the
 later "ODE approach" to the proof of the Exponential Theorem, since he first
 obtains the identity:

 elxey =ey+Ul(x-y) + Û(t2), ast^O.

 3 Here and in the sequel, when we cite reviews, it is understood that we refer to "Jahrbuch über die

 Fortschritte der Mathematik," at http://www.emis.de/projects/JFM.

 4 Each author uses his own notation and definition for the Bernoulli numbers, which we shall respect to
 preserve the flavor of the original formulas. For clarity, we introduce our separate conventional notation

 for the numbers Bn (which we call Bernoulli numbers ) defined unambiguously by the following generating
 function:

 n= 0

 - ez - - 7 1 = X z-- ' ~T til (ze€: 'z' < 2tt).

 We shall explicitly write the relationship occurring between these Bn and the constants used by the other
 authors.

 (iv) The first author who really exploited the ODE technique in an efficient way

 was Poincaré (1900), who characterized the solution z(t) of ez ^ = exety by the

 (formal) ordinary differential equation:

 z'(t> = ! Me-AäZ(t) (y>> *«>)=*•

 Note the hidden presence of the Bernoulli numbers, for

 In the setting of a Lie group of transformations, this ODE has a genuine meaning
 and is solved by Poincaré via the residue calculus, in such a way that the Lie-
 series nature of z(l) = 'og(exey) is exhibited. What Poincaré actually failed
 to point out was the existence of a universal Lie-series expansion for z(l) in
 terms of x and y, independent of any group context. Hausdorff and Bourbaki

 will later criticize Poincaré for his repeated reference to the group setting instead

 of using a symbolic approach. Notwithstanding this, in solving what he calls "le

 Problème de Campbell," Poincaré forged nothing less than the universal envel-

 oping algebra of a Lie algebra, and at least implicitly in his technique, we can find
 a constructive way to turn 'og(exey) into a Lie series. This is done in Poincaré
 (1900) by a subtle "symmetrization process" of polynomials which we shall
 analyze more in detail (see also Schmid 1982 and Ton-That and Tran 1999).
 (v) It was Pascal (1901a,b) who carried forward this symmetrization process, likely

 unaware that he was handling some computations that Poincaré properly in-

 scribed a year before in the setting of enveloping algebras. The similarity between

 the approaches of Poincaré and Pascal in attacking the Exponential Theorem is so

 striking that we could name this approach the Poincaré-Pascal technique , which,
 for its originality, would deserve to be rediscovered and formalized. Roughly
 xm vn

 speaking, Pascal de-constructs exey into Xm,n>0 7^1711 anc* ^en re-constructs
 this double series (via a certain symmetrization of polynomials and a delicate

 handling of constants) into X/*>o §T> f°r a suitable formal series z for which he
 also describes an iterative formula in terms of Lie brackets of x, y and the Ber-

 noulli numbers. Conscious of having thus provided a nodal contribution to the

 understanding of the composition of two exponentials in transformation group

 theory, Pascal deferred the convergence problem. For this omission, and for the
 massive computations employed, Engel (in reviewing Pascal 1901b, 1902c) and
 Hausdorff later criticized Pascal, while Bourbaki mentioned Pascal's name in

 passing only. Regardless of this legitimate criticism, Pascal's contribution to the
 CBHD Theorem is, without doubt, fundamental, and the present paper is an

 occasion to popularize it after more than one hundred years of oblivion.

 (vi) The main step toward a symbolic proof of the Exponential Theorem (this is the
 very name used by Baker 1901, 1905, §3, p. 35, see also Exponentialformel , in
 the title of Hausdorff 1906) comes with Baker's and Hausdorff 's proofs. Some

 core computations and the main formulas obtained in the two papers Baker
 (1905) and Hausdorff (1906) are so similar that it is not easy to realize that they

 are independent of each other. Ipso facto, Hausdorff 's study (1906) was pub-
 lished one year after (Baker 1905), but no mention of Baker (1905) is made in
 Hausdorff (1906), though the analogies are several. Campbell's series z'(x, y )
 in (1) reappears in a very "quantitative" way, and Baker and Hausdorff prove
 that it generates log(exey) in the following form:

 exey = ez, where z = V ^ - J ( z' (x, y) - 0 ) y. (2)

 ^ J / 0 ' n

 ~b! V dyj

 Here z' ^ is a sort of "substitutional operation" (as Baker called it, later also
 named polar derivative ), more precisely it is the derivation of the associative

 algebra of the formal power series in jc , y which is defined by z' j^(x) = 0

 and z' ^00 = zi. Owing to the puzzling notations used by Baker in proving
 (2), when compared to the undoubted clarity of Hausdorff 's exposition, Bour-
 baki will consecrate Hausdorff as the only reliable source. Despite this fact,
 the appropriate naming for (2) seems to us to be the Baker-Hausdorjf Formula.
 Hence, the designation "Campbell-Hausdorff Formula" (in use, in books at least,

 seemingly after Jacobson 1962) is more an abused tradition (so entrenched that

 one can do nothing but get along with it) than a reference to the actual history

 of the theorem. Furthermore, if one looks for something that may be called a

 "Formula," Hausdorff provided at least another two of them, whereas Campbell
 provided none (so what is the "Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff Formula" after all?).
 Among Hausdorff 's contributions, we include the successful recursion formula

 which can be obtained by the identity:

 ( d ' ( d ' r Adz
 {" ( Tx ) ' z + V ( ' r z] + T=7^(" + y)~

 and by decomposing z into homogenous summands with respect to x and y
 jointly. This recursion formula will return in Djokovic (1975) and in Varadarajan
 (1984).

 (vii) Rather than speaking of a Formula of Campbell, Baker, and Hausdorff, the "great-

 est common divisor" shared by the contributions of these three mathematicians is

 the following statement (more a qualitative result than an actual formula): In the

 associative algebra ( over a field of characteristic zero) of the formal power series

 in two non-commuting indeterminate s x and y, the series related to 'og(exey)
 is a series of Lie polynomials. This may be referred to as the Campbell-Baker-
 Hausdorff Theorem.

 (viii) Proceeding with the above (provocative) disquisition about "formulas," probably
 the most important one is due to someone who is not even mentioned in the nam-
 ing "Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff Formula." It is indeed Dynkin (1947) who (for

 the very first time and more than 40 years after Hausdorff 's paper) furnished in

 closed form the sought-for explicit presentation of'og(exey) in terms of iterated

 brackets, the so-called Dynkin' s Formula. Nowadays, it is customary to mention

 Dynkin' s name within the contributions to the Exponential Theorem only when

 his representation is involved. In fact, Dynkin's contribution is paramount for
 other distinguished reasons which we shall discuss in detail in Sect. 9 (and which

 have inspired our acronym CBHD); among these reasons is the merit of having

 provided another proof of the Exponential Theorem (completely different from

 the preceding ones, see Dynkin 1949) enlightening all the combinatorial aspects

 behind the theorem, together with a proof of the convergence matter, far more

 natural and simpler than Hausdorff's.

 (ix) After 30 years after the mentioned paper (Hausdorff 1906), Yosida contributed

 to clarify some passages in Hausdorff's main argument, dropping the symbolic
 polar derivatives in favor of the usual differentiation with respect to real (or
 complex) parameters.

 To ease the reading, in Table 1 we furnished a chronological list of the original con-
 tributions we shall be dealing with (in the range of period 1890-1950).

 2 The origin of the problem

 The main theorem we are concerned with in this paper has its roots in Sophus Lie's
 theory of the so-called finite continuous groups of transformations. As is well known,

 302 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 what we now call "Lie groups" are quite different from what Lie himself occasionally

 referred to as "his groups" and what he studied during the second half of the nineteenth

 century. Since we do not need Lie's original theory elsewhere in the paper, we confine

 ourselves in recalling a (simplified) definition of continuous group of transformations
 (for more details, see Hawkins 1989, 1991, 2000; see also Montgomery and Zippin
 1955 or Varadarajan 1984, §2.16).5

 To this end, let Em denote (real or complex) m -dimensional Euclidean space and

 let A ç Er be an open neighborhood of 0, and £2 ç En be some domain. Then a finite

 continuous group of transformations is a family of maps indexed by a e A

 /(•, a) : Q ^ Q, x xr = f(x , a ),

 such that the following properties are satisfied (together with others omitted for brevity;

 0 is chosen as identity element for simplicity):

 (i) the maps (x, a) h-> f(x, a) are analytic and /( jc, 0) = x for every x'
 (ii) for every couple (a, b) e A x A there exists a unique cp(a,b) e A such that

 /(/(*, tf ), b) = f(x, <p(a , b)), for every x e Q. (3)

 It is not difficult to see that the map (a, b) !-► <p(a,b) then defines a (local) analytic

 group, so that, in modern words, a transformation group is nothing but the germ of a
 group action on a domain of Rn or Cn.

 Throughout the paper, when we speak of a group of transformation (or of a trans-

 formation group), we always refer to the above definition.

 A key role is played by the so-called infinitesimal transformations of the transfor-
 mation group, something very similar to what we would now call the relevant Lie
 algebra. For every j = 1, . . . , r, every smooth function Fonß and every x e Q, let
 us set

 ¥W 3 = yMM.^). *-> (4) K '
 ¥W 3 = *-> da; dxi (4) K '

 l = ' J

 The action on F of the differential operator Xy= l aj provides, as is easily seen,
 the limit

 r F(f(x,ea))-F(x)
 r lim
 £-►0 e

 thus it furnishes a sort of "weight" of the infinitesimal transformation in the "direction"
 of the parameter a = (a' , . . . , ar).

 5 It is also of interest to refer to some books on ODEs from the first decades of the twentieth century,
 to see how groups of transformations (originally conceived by Lie for differential equation purposes) still
 played a role in the ODE theory of those years: see, e.g., Campbell (1903), Cohen (1931), Ince (1927), and

 Pascal (1903). A beautiful exposition of the ODE/PDE contents of the theory of transformation groups is
 contained in Eisenhart (1933).

 a', ... ,ar being scalars and x e Q. If the parameters ai are small enough, the position

 makes sense, and it defines the desired transformation group. The proof of the exis-

 tence of the relevant group law (p{a,b) is not so direct: cp is the solution of suitable (first

 order) PDE problems integrability of which derives from the existence of constants

 Cijk satisfying (5).6

 Despite the concealed nature of , the above facts contain the core of the CBHD

 Theorem as we now describe. Indeed, the Maclaurin expansion of y is

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 303

 The Second Fundamental Theorem of Lie ensures that the span of the X' , . . . , Xr

 is closed under the usual bracket operation, i.e., there exist constants cijk (called the

 structure constants of the transformation group) such that

 [Xi,Xj] = ^CijkXk, for every/, j = (5)

 r

 k='

 The converse of this fact (part of the Second Fundamental Theorem too) is less

 trivial, stating that, if the independent analytic vector fields X' , . . . , Xr on the domain

 ficR" span a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, then they are the infinitesimal trans-
 formations of some group of transformations. The arguments to prove this fact make

 use of the one parameter groups generated by the family of vector fields X', ... , Xr,

 namely, the solutions to the ODE system

 y( 0)=X

 where A = a • X := a'X' H

 f(x,a):=y( 1) (7)

 00 fk a k(r'

 y(t) ~ X - - =: e'A(x)< (8)

 k=0

 justifying the exponential notation for y (t). From (7) and from the group property (3),

 it follows that the composition of two exponentials must obey the following law (here

 o is the composition of functions, see also the notation in (6)):

 eA o eB = ec , where A=a-X,B=b-X,C = cp(a, b) • X. (9)

 Baker (1905, p. 24) expresses very clearly a notable intuition about the product of

 two exponentials: "it is an obvious suggestion of Lie's theory that the product eAeB is

 of the form ec, where C is a series of alternants [i.e., of brackets] of A and B ," even

 under the only assumption that A and B are any " two non-commutative quantities ."

 6 For a more exhaustive exposition of this approach to the Second Fundamental Theorem, having an his-
 torical interest and tracing back to Lie himself, see, e.g., Schur (1890a), Pascal (1903), and Eisenhart
 (1933).

 In facing this question, Baker was preceded by Campbell (1898, see the incipit ), who,

 for the first time, proposed to investigate the quantity eAeB from a purely symbolic
 point of view. Later, this was to be called Campbell's Problem , see Poincaré (1900,
 p. 232) and Hausdorff (1906, p. 20).

 It is then clear that the study of the "product" of two exponentials, originating from
 Lie's theory of transformation groups, deserved independent attention to be under-

 stood in its generality. Lie did not pay much attention to this problem, for the equation

 eAeB = ec was, roughly speaking, contained in the axiomatic identity (3) of his theory
 (or, more precisely, in the proof of his Second Fundamental Theorem). What Lie did

 not prove, however, was the fact that the law of formation of C as a series of brackets
 of A, B is in fact "universal":

 C = A + B + '[A, B] + £ [A[A, B}} - ^ [B[A, B]] + ± [A[B[B, A]]] + ■■■ ,

 and that the structure constants cijk of the given group intervene only if one wants
 to write C in the basis {X' , . . . , Xr } (this basis decomposition being immaterial for
 the study of the "symbolic" identity eAeB = ec). The universal symbolic nature of C
 is the topic that Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin eventually addressed, thus

 untying the Exponential Theorem from the original group context where it was born,

 and lending it an interest in its own right.

 Let us finally recall Lie's Third Fundamental Theorem, originally stated as follows:

 Lie's Third Theorem. Given r3 real constants {cijk}i,j,k<r satisfying the conditions

 cijk ^ ~cjiki ^ jiÇijsCskh ~f~ cjkscsih ~i" ckiscsjh) = 0, (10)

 r

 s= 1

 for every i, j, h,k = 1, . . . , r, there exists a transformation group whose structure

 constants are the Cijk, i.e., such that the infinitesimal transformations X' , . . . , Xr of
 this group satisfy

 [Xi,Xj] = YJCijkXk. (11)

 r

 k='

 Throughout the sequel, when we speak of Lie's Third (Fundamental) Theorem, we

 tacitly make reference to the above result, which is significantly different from what is

 nowadays understood as the Third Fundamental Theorem of Lie. (Roughly speaking,
 the original result is a local version of the modern one.7)

 7 The modern, global version of Lie's Third Theorem is the following one: For every finite dimensional
 real Lie algebra q there exists a Lie group G such that g is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of G . Here the
 notion of Lie group is, obviously, the modern one. The proof of this global form of the theorem is of a

 different caliber, much more involved than the proof for the original version: some arguments require, e.g.,
 Ado's Theorem asserting that every finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero has a
 faithful linear representation. For a very recent functorial version of Lie's Third Theorem, see Hofmann
 and Morris (2005).

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 305

 Besides precursory studies by Schur, the link between Lie's Third Theorem and

 the Exponential Theorem was first fully understood (as we shall explain) by Poincaré,
 whose proof of the Third Theorem is more or less the modern one we would give
 today starting from the CBHD Theorem (see also the end of Sect. 1.1.1 in Bonfiglioli
 and Fulci 2012).

 With the above recollections at hand, we are ready to analyze more closely the

 contributions of Schur, Campbell, Poincaré, Pascal, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin to
 the Exponential Theorem.

 3 Schur's contribution

 Schur's8 papers (Schur 1 890a, b, 1 89 1 , 1 893) are to a large extent devoted to providing
 new derivations of Lie's Fundamental Theorems, using an insightful way of rewriting

 the group condition (3) via suitable systems of PDEs. Schur (1890a) provides condi-
 tions (involving the Jacobian matrix of the map b i->- <p(a, b) at the identity) which
 turn out to be equivalent to some fundamental identities of Lie's theory. Actually, in
 dealing with a new proof of Lie's Third Fundamental Theorem, Schur (1890a, §3)
 constructs a transformation group (under a choice of canonical coordinates) only by

 means of suitable multivariate power series depending on the structure constants. This

 is clearly a forerunner of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorjf Theorem.

 Indeed, anticipating the modern use of logarithmic coordinates (see Schur 1891,

 § 1 ), Schur proves that the composition law (a , b) h-> (p(a,b) related to the (canonically

 parametrized) group (7) can be written down explicitly as a series depending (poly-

 nomially) on the structure constants Cijk . Schur, like Lie, did not catch the universal
 law of bracket-formation which underlies the analytic expression of (p(a, b): hence his
 contribution to the form of the CBHD Formula as we now know it can be exaggerated.

 However, he perfectly realized that an explicit formula for <p, depending only on the

 Cijk s, was the right tool to prove Lie's Third Fundamental Theorem, a theorem which
 is, as we now understand, deeply related to the CBHD Theorem.

 Schur's methods are direct and as natural as one should expect: besides the cited

 use of the canonical choice of parameters, they are mainly based on an integration of
 the above mentioned differentiated versions of the group property by the method of

 power series (the convergence of the resulting series being always carefully proved).
 In Schur (1890b), he then turns to represent the infinitesimal transformations of a tran-

 sitive group by means of quotients of power series and of some absolute constants,
 structured on the Bernoulli numbers Bw .

 As an example of Schur's plain computations with power series, we would like to
 recall a remarkable formula (Schur 1 890b, Eq. (2), p. 2), which catches one's eyes for

 itsexplicitness:If&> = (&>;j(w)) is the Jacobian matrix of v cp(u , ü)ati> = 0 (which
 gives the infinitesimal transformations for the so-called first parameter group), then

 ® Friedrich Heinrich Schur; Maciejewo, near Krotoschin, Prussia (now Krotoszyn, Poland), 1 856 - Breslau,
 Prussia (now Wroclaw, Poland), 1932. Friedrich Schur should not be confused with the coeval mathemati-

 cian, likely more famous, Issai Schur (Mogilev, 1875; Tel Aviv, 1941). While Friedrich Schur was a follower
 of the school of Sophus Lie, Issai Schur was a student of Frobenius and Fuchs in Berlin. For a source on
 Berlin mathematicians in the nineteenth century, see Biermann (1988).

 where Sij is Kronecker' s symbol, the constants Xm are related to the Bernoulli num-

 bers9 by the relation Xm = B m/m', and the functions are explicitly defined by

 uijM= Z cj'Aih2--'ctzlj,m.l4m.t.hm»hluH2---uhm. (i3)

 Here u = (u ' , . . . , ur ) is a point of some neighborhood of the origin of Rr and the c' y

 are the structure constants of the transformation group (in Schur's notation, c' . stands
 for cijs ; in the review to Schur (1 890a), Engel firmly criticizes Schur for not generally
 following Lie's notations). Vice versa, given constants c? . satisfying (10), i.e., the
 usual compatibility assumptions modeled on skew-symmetry and Jacobi identities,

 the above matrix (a>ij) gives the component functions of the infinitesimal transfor-
 mations of a transformation group having the c • • as structure constants (see Schur
 1891, Satz 2, p. 271).

 Since a transformation group can be regained by exponentiating its infinitesimal

 transformations, the above results give information on the group itself. Aware of the

 impact of his results on the theory of transformation groups, Schur (1891) gives yet
 another simplified version of the results of his former papers and, later Schur (1893),

 the remarkable result that C2 assumptions on the functions / and (p actually guarantee

 that they can be transformed (by a change of variables) into analytic functions. This

 very notable fact (besides opening the way to Hilbert's famous fifth problem10) has
 nowadays become a central topic of Lie group theory which is usually proved (by
 sheer chance) by means of the CBHD formula itself, highlighting the deep link of
 Schur's results with the Exponential Theorem.

 While Schur will be mentioned by his successors mainly for the discovery of the
 role of the Bernoulli numbers in the composition of infinitesimal transformations, we
 explicitly remark that it will be Pascal who points out how the transformations in
 (12) can be obtained by the Exponential Theorem; see Pascal (1902c, §2, p. 565).

 9 Schur introduces the constants Xm as satisfying a suitable recursion formula involving products of degree
 two (Schur 1890a, Eq. (56), p. 178):

 (m + 1 )Am = - (À2Àm_2 + À3À.W_ 3 H

 •* = 1 - - + V (-pg-' ß2«-] x2y X
 ex_x = 1 - - 2 + ~ (-pg-' (2 q)' X ■

 q= 1

 This means that, in our notation, B2q~' = (- 1)^-1B2 q.

 In fact, Hilbert quotes Schur (1893), see Alexandrov et al. (1979).

 he denotes as follows:

 This is another confirmation of the intertwinement of Schur's studies with the CBHD

 Theorem.

 4 Campbell's contribution

 Campbell's1 1 1 897 paper (Campbell 1 897a) is the very first in the history of the Expo-
 nential Theorem. It can be considered as by far one of the most readable works on
 the subject: it is written in a concise style, yet its 10 pages contain a great variety of

 remarkable formulas which will return in every subsequent paper on the subject. Let
 us see what Campbell (1897a) proves.

 To begin with, he establishes the following identity12:

 ^4- = T , yv (AdxV(y) relU(O), (14)

 where the constants aj are defined by the recursion formula

 ao = 1, a' = 1/2

 i ( ^ o (15)

 yi = yx - xy, yr = yr-'x - xyr-' ( r > 2).

 We preferred to reserve the square brackets for the commutator [y, x] = yx - xy, which Campbell instead
 denotes by (y, jc), and to rewrite yr = [-- [[y, x],x]-- , x] in terms of left adjoints (- Ad x)r (y).

 aJ = 7+T i v ^~1 - aJ~i y J^2' ^ o

 Campbell acknowledges Schur for the discovery of the constants aj (later in his second
 paper - Campbell (1898), he establishes the link between the af s and the Bernoulli
 numbers). Here jc, y are pictured by Campbell as "operators," but actually they can be

 any elements of an associative non-commutative algebra.

 Then, Campbell takes up an ingenious manipulation of certain formal power series,

 though neglecting any matter of convergence. Even if his intention is to apply his
 identities to the infinitesimal transformations of a group, his computations actually

 apply only in the algebra of the formal power series in two indeterminates x, y .

 Though Campbell will eventually be faulted by Bourbaki for a lack of clarity about

 the context of his calculations (is it a transformation group, or the algebra of for-

 mal series, or a finite-dimensional algebra of vector fields?), the importance of his

 results on the Exponential Theorem is undoubted. For example, we feel compelled to
 exhibit Campbell's computation on p. 384 of Campbell (1897a) (which will reappear
 in modern proofs; see Cartier 1956 and Djokovic 1975): Let us set

 11 John Edward Campbell; Lisburn (Ireland), 1862 - Oxford (England), 1924.

 12 Here and in what follows, we use some different notations with respect to Campbell's, for those notations
 conflicting with the usual ones. For instance, Campbell denotes the sum xlyxr~l by [yxr] and he
 also introduces the sequence

 (this will turn out to be the subseries of'og(eyex) containing y precisely once, a crucial
 series in the CBHD Formula). Then we have

 yex = ^ (use (14) and interchange sums)

 Note that this is the crucial point where the "symmetrized" sums 2;=o JC'ZJC'S_' ap-
 pear; analogous sums reappear in Poincaré (1900), Pascal (1901a), Baker (1905), and
 Hausdorff (1906).

 Campbell's argument on the convergence of &s(ß2) is quite unconvincing
 (see Campbell 1 897a, pp. 384-385), and this exhibits once again that his computations
 are to be considered only formally. However, Campbell obtains a fruitful formula:

 [ (1 + ßy) ex = ex+ßz + ^(/z2),
 1 uv * ex+ßZ x+uz 2x where z = z(x, y) is as in (16), (18)
 1 [ eßy uv ex * = ex+ßZ x+uz + Ü(ß2), 2x

 and the aj are explicitly given by (15).

 A few years later, Poincaré will use similar formulas as a starting point for his ODE

 techniques in attacking the Exponential Theorem.

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 309

 Now Campbell reveals to us his intent. He considers a set {X', . . . , Xr] of oper-

 ators (i.e., linear analytic first-order differential operators on some domain of Rw),

 such that [Xi, Xj] = X*=i cijk %k (where the ctjk are constants). Campbell aims
 to give a direct proof of Lie's Second Theorem and prove that, if X, Y belong to
 V := span{Xi, . . . , Xr }, then there exists Z e V such that ez = eY o ex , where, to
 fix the notation, ex is the finite transformation:

 x I- > ex (x) := ^1 + X + ^ X ^ + • • • ^ (x).

 In order to prove the Second Fundamental Theorem, his only tools are (18) and the fol-

 lowing interesting fact. [Here we disambiguate Campbell's results by using some mod-

 ern notation, obviously not used in Campbell (1 897a).] Let us denote by x I-»- yx (t, x)
 the flow at time t of the vector field X starting at x (see also (6), (7), and (8)). Then
 one has (see Campbell 1897a, Eq. ( ß ), p. 386)

 (etX o Y o e~,x ) (x) = Yyx(t,x) (Yxi~t, •)), (19)

 where e±tX on the left-hand side are considered as a series of differential operators.
 Now, the sides of (19) are as follows:

 - after a simple computation, the left-hand side is

 00 r
 et AdX(y) - (Ad X)r(Y);
 /•= o r'

 - the right-hand side is the operator Y'x , obtained by expressing

 r,- = t,uU')£r 0
 7 = 1 0 j

 in the new coordinates x defined by x = e~tX{x ') = yx(- t, xf).

 With Campbell's compact notation, (19) becomes13

 e'Adx(Y) = Y/, where a (20)

 310 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 Anticipating some ideas from the subsequent paper (Campbell 1898), Campbell's
 proof of the Second Theorem could be described as follows14:

 1. In determining eY o ex , eY can be replaced by iterated applications of 1 + fi Y,

 where fi is so small that 0{ii2) can be ignored. Indeed, as in ordinary algebra,

 eY = lim (1 + Y/n)n. (21)

 n~>oo

 2. Thus, in computing ( eY o ex)(x), it is enough to consider a recursion process, based

 on iterated applications of 1 + /jl Y applied to a finite transformation x' = ex(x ),

 where the infinitesimal transformation X will change at each step.

 3. Now, by taking care of the proper substitutions, we have

 ((1 + fiY) o ex) (x) = (1 + fi

 where Y' has the same meaning as in the far right-hand side of (20). By the identity
 in the left-hand side of (20), we find that Y' is a Lie series in X, Y . Hence, Y'

 belongs to V = span{Xi, . . . , Xr}, since X, Y e V, and V is a Lie algebra. Thus,
 the Second Fundamental Theorem will follow if we can write (1 + (i Y')(x' ) as
 ez(x), where Y' is any element of V .

 4. Given any X, Y in V , the first identity in (18) ensures that

 (1+ fi Y) ex = ex+lxZ> + Û{fi2),

 where, by (16), Z' = z(X, Y) is a series of brackets in X, Y . From the same
 reasoning as above, we infer Z' e V. Setting X' := X 4- M Z', we have X' e V
 too, and the above identity can be rewritten as

 (1 +fiY)ex =ex< +0(fi2).

 5. By the same argument as in the previous step, we have

 (1 + fi Y)2 ex = (1 + fi Y) eXl + û(fi2) (= e*2 + 2 0{fi2),

 where X2 := X' + ß Z2 and Z2 = z(X 1, Y).

 As a matter of fact, Campbell considers the above arguments sufficient to obtain a
 proof of the Second Theorem and the paper (Campbell 1897a) simply ends with the

 suggestion to take /z = 1 /n, with n large. Probably aware of the fact that his previous
 argument is not convincing, Campbell writes a continuation paper (Campbell 1898).
 [Meanwhile, he also had to write a paper (Campbell 1897b) in correction of a state-
 ment made in Campbell (1897a) on a generalization which he sought to derive from
 his arguments.]

 14 As a matter of fact, Campbell's argument is not very transparent from now on, and his proof should
 be considered only as a sketch: nonetheless, we think it is interesting to see how he uses his previous
 remarkable computations.

 Mainly, Campbell has to deal with the problems (evidently left open from the above
 arguments) to manage the "convergence" of the sequence Xn to some Xqq and the
 vanishing of n Ô'i/JL2) as n -» oo.

 Let us briefly review the results of the second paper. First, Campbell recognizes the

 relationship between his constants aj in (15) and the Bernoulli numbers.15 Next, by
 means of more sophisticated computations on iterated bracket identities (valid in any

 associative algebra), he derives the following formal-series result16:

 This identity will help in dealing with a problem, contained implicitly in the previous
 paper, which we now describe in detail. In the following exposition, our task is to
 make precise Campbell's ideas in Campbell (1898, §13, p. 23), so where necessary
 we introduce some concepts and notation not contained therein (signaling our inter-
 vention in footnotes). To this aim, it is convenient to denote by 91 the associative
 algebra of formal series in the letters x, y}1 Following (16), we introduce a func-
 tion

 z : -»■ 9t, z(u ) := ^(- l)y'a;- (AdM)y'(y),

 15 Campbell recognizes the relationship between his an and Schur's constants kn : it holds that «2n+ 1 = 0

 aZn ln = (-l)"_1 n > 1,
 aZn ln = (2n)!

 With our compact notation, we have an = for n > 2.

 16 See Campbell (1898, Eq. (D), p. 20), which must be corrected putting (r - m)' in place of
 (n-m)l.

 17 As always, Campbell pictures x, y as differential operators, but he manipulates series in x and y
 with no care for convergence; hence, we preferred to introduce the algebra of formal power series in x
 and y.

 where the aj are as in (15).18 Fixing a constant fi , let us consider the following se-
 quence of maps Pn : 5t, defined inductively by

 312 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 P0(w) := m + ^z(w), PI(m) := z(P0(w)),
 Prt(M):=Pw_i(P0(w)), «>2.

 In other words, denoting by Pq the n-fold composition of Po with itself, we have

 pnz= zo Pq , for every n > 1. (24)

 Next, we have to introduce another sequence of maps xn : 5t -> 5t, namely

 jtn(w) := Pq (m), for every n > 0. (25)

 (Here it is understood that Pq (w) = u.) We shall soon be interested in xn(x): note
 that, because of (25) and the form of z, every xn(x) is a Lie series inx,y universally

 determined by the Bernoulli-type numbers aj.

 Since Po(w) = u + ßz(u), we get

 jcw+i(m) = x n(u) + /iz(xn(u )), for every n > 0. (26)

 As a simple inductive proof shows, the functions xn can also be rewritten as follows:

 *n = P 0 + M (^l + Pi + * • • + P n-i)> n > 2. (27)

 Now Campbell (1897a) recalls one of the crucial identities, namely, the first one in

 (18) above: treating the x as a pure symbol (allowing us to substitute for it any other

 element of our algebra 51), one has

 (1 + fiy) eu = 4. ß2 R(u ), for every u g 51. (28)

 Here R(u) is some "remainder" term, to which Campbell does not pay too much
 attention. As a consequence of (26) and (28), we obtain at once

 (1 + fiy) eXn(<u) = eXn+l^ + ß2 R(xn(u )), for every n > 0. (29)

 Applying (1 + jiy)r~n~x to both members of (29), summing up for n = 0, . . . , r - 1
 and canceling out, Campbell provides the following important identity:

 (1 + fiy)r ex = exr(x) + ß2 £(1 + ßy)r-n~l R(x„(x)), (30)

 r- 1

 n= 0

 18 Campbell never introduced z as a function, but, with long paraphrases, he repeatedly speaks of "substi-
 tuting [some series] for x in z," when z "has been expressed explicitly in terms of x and _y." The functional
 approach is evidently more convenient.

 holding true for every re IN U {0}. The idea is now to take (i = '/r and let r -> oo.

 The above left-hand side then goes to eyex (see also (21)). Moreover, with a (maybe
 too) rough estimate on the second summand in the right-hand side of (30), Camp-
 bell states that this second summand can be ignored, for it has the same behavior as

 r 0(1 /r2). He then concentrates on the existence (in a formal sense only) of

 Xoo := lim xr(x),

 r- >oo

 and he attacks the problem of deriving some explicit formula for xœ. To this aim, the
 decomposition (27) is employed, together with long and complicated estimates. For
 example, as far as the summands Pq{x) + P'(x) are concerned, we have (note that
 the previous algebraic computations in (22) are now employed)

 (Campbell 1 898) does not mention any underlying group structure: a remarkable break

 with respect to Campbell ( 1 897a). Baker and Hausdorff will concentrate their attention

 in this abstract direction. Finally, Campbell (1903) provides a comprehensive treatise

 on transformation groups, much in the spirit of ODEs; in Chapter IV of his monograph

 (Campbell 1903), the proof of the Exponential Theorem (as given in Campbell 1 897a)
 is reproduced in detail.

 As we shall see in Sect. 6, Campbell's and Pascal's contributions are compara-

 ble from many points of view. Indeed, they share the following common features:
 many results (a symbolic Exponential Theorem with a sketched recursion formula

 for higher-order terms), some techniques, the laboriousness of the computations, the

 intents (applications to transformation group theory), the presence of some lacunœ.
 So the question is: why has Pascal's contribution been totally forgotten? The answer
 to this question, supposing it may ever be given, is lost in the twists and turns of

 mathematical history.

 5 Poincaré's contribution

 It was Poincaré19 who first realized the link between Schur's proof of the Third Fun-

 damental Theorem and what he defined "le Problème de Campbell" (this is the title
 of §IV in Poincaré (1900)).

 Indeed, given a transformation group with infinitesimal transformations X', . . . , Xr

 as in (4), the one-parameter subgroups (see the exponential notation introduced in (8))

 t^e,x (X6fl:=span{Xi,...,Xr})

 generate the group of transformations. Hence, if Campbell's identity ev eT = ew has
 a precise analytic meaning (defining W as a converging Lie series in V and T , hence

 as an element of g), then it follows that the whole transformation group can be recon-

 structed from g (or equivalently, by its structure constants). Poincaré anticipated the

 modern way of thinking about the CBHD Theorem as the tool for reconstructing the

 group law by means of the brackets in the Lie algebra. More precisely, as we shall
 explain later, he showed how to derive from Campbell's identity eveT = ew a proof
 of the Third Fundamental Theorem, much in the spirit of Schur, as Poincaré himself
 declares: C'est au fond la démonstration de Schur (Poincaré 1900, p. 235).

 The arguments sketched above show the necessity of giving a precise analytic solu-

 tion to Campbell's problem, and Poincaré (1900) devotes the last five long paragraphs
 to this problem. We refer the reader to Schmid (1982) for a comprehensive account on

 Poincaré's contribution to the theory of Lie's transformation groups (and to Ton-That
 and Tran 1999 for his contribution to the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem); here we

 confine ourselves to pointing out his contribution to the development of the CBHD
 Theorem.

 The most impressive fact about Poincaré's contribution is that, in solving an impor-
 tant problem, he creates an even more important tool: in fact, Sect. Ill of Poincaré

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 315

 (1900) gives birth to what we now call the universal enveloping algebra % (g) of a

 Lie algebra g. Though Poincaré considers, ipso facto, only finite-dimensional Lie alge-

 bras over a field of characteristic zero, his ingenious idea is exactly the same one later

 rediscovered by Birkhoff and Witt in the general case. Suppose a finite-dimensional
 Lie algebra20 is given, spanned by some "symbols" X',...,Xr (called generators)
 and equipped with the bracket determined by the structure identities

 [Xh Xj] = Xs, ij = r. (32)

 r

 S='

 Poincaré then introduces an equivalence relation on the set of formal polynomials in

 the generators, by calling equivalent any two polynomials difference between which

 is a linear combination of two-sided products of the polynomials:

 XiXj-XjXi-lXi^Xjl (33)

 After investigation of Poincaré (1900, §111), we agree with Hausdorff-Bourbaki in
 saying that Poincaré's exposition of the above construction is not free from some
 ambiguity.21 Nonetheless, the cause for this ambiguity may be less trivial than it
 seems: Poincaré wanted to describe the way to construct ^ (g) from g for potentially

 arbitrary g's; but then, in performing computations with infinitesimal transformations,

 he treats the formal product X Y - Y X as the difference of true compositions of vector
 fields:

 X oY -Y oX.

 Since (as we now know) the enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of

 vector fields X ' , . . . , Xr can be identified with the associative algebra of the operators

 spanned by

 X"1 o • • • o X"r , n',...,nr > 0,

 equipped with the composition of linear differential operators, Poincaré's identity

 20 Lacking the general definition of a Lie algebra that was later introduced by Weyl in the 1930s, Poincaré
 pictured his Lie algebras as spanned by analytic vector fields: typically, the infinitesimal transformations
 of a group. However, in introducing the enveloping algebra, he never makes use of an underlying group of
 transformations.

 21 For example, identity (1) on p. 224 writes XY - YX = [X, Y] whereas identity (2) contains the non-
 trivial quantity XY - YX - [X, Y], with the statement (a few lines below) that XY - YX is of second
 degree whereas [X, Y] is of first degree, whence they cannot be equal, contradicting the cited identity (1).
 As a matter of fact, Poincaré seems to write identity ( 1 ) only to trace a parallel between what happens for

 infinitesimal transformations of a group (where the bracketing has the alternant form X o Y - Y o X) and
 what it is expected to happen in the set of his formal polynomials, modulo (33). In other words, consistent
 with a later use of the symbol of equality in Poincaré (1900), the sign "=" in (1) should be interpreted as a

 congruence modulo the two-sided ideal generated by (33).

 can be applied with full justification in this vector field setting.

 Next, Poincaré sketches the proof of the remarkable fact that any homogeneous for-

 mal polynomial of degree p is equivalent to a certain uniquely determined polynomial
 (called regular) which is a linear combination of polynomials of the form

 [X, Y] = XY - YX

 (ot'X' +a2X2 + --)p.

 In practice, this is the (linear) isomorphism of°t/ (g) with the symmetric algebra of the

 vector space g. We notice that he represents symmetric polynomials as powers of lin-

 ear polynomials, a form particularly suited for the purpose of building up exponential
 series. This construction is exhaustively described (together with the filling of some
 omissis in Poincaré's arguments) in Ton-That and Tran (1999).

 If V, T are linear combinations of X' , . . . , Xr , Poincaré considers a formal product

 of type:

 ever =

 y ^ mini
 m,n> 0

 motivated by the theory of transformation groups.22 His aim is to prove by direct
 methods what Lie's Second Fundamental Theorem ipso facto assures, namely, the
 existence of W such that eveT = ew . (Note that here Poincaré seems to return to the

 operator nature of these exponentials, rather than their being polynomial series.)

 With his considerations on the universal enveloping algebra at hand , Poincaré then

 introduces a momentous way of rewriting eveT , aiming directly at getting W , which

 deserves to be carefully considered for its originality. Indeed, the monomial VmTn

 can be made equivalent to a sum of regular polynomials, say

 -TT mini = TW(p,m,n), ' (34)
 -TT mini '

 m+n

 P= 0

 22 This is another delicate point: first Poincaré introduces etX as an operator, acting on functions in the
 obvious way

 e,X(f) = f + -X(f) t + - X2(f) + - t X3(/) + • • • ,

 t t2 t 3

 having further care to recall that this series converges for small t ( X is implicitly assumed to be analytic so
 that the above one is actually the expansion of f(y (f)), where y is an integral curve of X ). But a few lines

 after, he writes exeY = Xm,n Xm'n' ' ^ ^ considered as operators, then the correct expansion

 has X and Y interchanged. Consequently, Poincaré now considers ex , eY only as purely symbolic series.
 This mixture of operator/symbolic objects (Poincaré often specializes his symbolic formulas in identities
 in the algebra of the operators) is the cause for some discrepancy.

 where W(p, m, n) (besides being symmetric) is homogeneous of degree p. Conse-

 quently, we get

 p= o 'm+n>p f P=0

 Note that Wp is a regular formal series , homogeneous of degree /?. Poincaré observes
 that, if we seek for a W , homogenous of degree 1, such that
 then is regular and homogeneous of degree p. Hence, by the uniqueness of the
 regularization process, we must have

 = ^ (36)

 p'

 Roughly speaking, W' is nothing but the CBHD series.

 This fact deserves some clarification. In identity (34), we have

 - V and T are elements of the Lie algebra g := span{Xi, . . . , Xr} (recall that the

 Xf s satisfy (32));

 - The "=" sign must be read as an identity in the enveloping algebra ^ (g), i.e., a
 congruence modulo the ideal generated by (33). Thus, in computing the degree of

 homogeneity, the brackets [X/, Xj] must be considered of degree 1.

 Alternatively, if we temporarily disregard the Lie algebra span{Xi, . . . , Xr} and we
 consider only Lie algebras of vector fields (whose enveloping algebra can be iden-
 tified with the associative algebra of polynomials in basis elements), then (34) may
 be considered as an authentic equality (not a congruence), obtainable by repeated

 applications of the identity:

 VT = TV + [V, T]. (37)

 However, in this case, the concept of homogenous-degree is purely formal. This alter-
 native use of V and T is not far-fetched, for two good reasons as follows:

 - it reflects Poincaré's double use of the identity [V, T ] = VT - TV (later considered

 ambiguous by his reviewers);

 - most importantly, it allows the construction of the very important W' as a Lie series

 in the symbols V and T only ; by means of a universal construction.

 For example, consider the following computation (where (37) is used):

 VT = ' VT + ' VT = ' (VT + TV) + ' [V, T]

 = ' (V + T)2 - ' V2 - ' T2 + ' [V, T],

 With the notation in (34), this gives

 W(0, 1, 1)=0, W(l, 1, 1) = '[V, T], W(2, 1, 1) = ' ({V+T)2-V2-T2^.

 Again, consider the identity (which we can derive by means of (37) only)

 VT 2
 - = 5 (VTT + TVT + TT V) + ± ([ V , T]T + T[V, T]) + ±[T, [T, V]],

 so that W(1 , 1, 2) = j2.[T, [T, V]]. An analogous computation ensures that
 W(l, 2, 1) = ±[V, [V, T]], whence

 Wj = W(l, 1,0) + W(l, 0, 1) + W(l, 1, 1) + W( 1,2, 1) + W(l, 1, 2) + • • •

 = V + T + ' [V, T] + £[V, [V, T]] + £[7' [T, V]] + ■ ■ ■

 We recognize the first few terms of the CBHD series !

 Since Poincaré is interested primarily in a new proof of the Third Fundamental

 Theorem (for which it is sufficient that W' be a convergent Lie series in the Xj 's),
 an explicit derivation of a formula for W' in terms of repeated brackets of V and
 T is immaterial for the scope of Poincaré (1900), and is therefore omitted. But we

 agree with Schmid (1982, p. 182) who writes that "the answer follows easily from
 his methods." In the light of these facts, the original contribution by Poincaré to the
 CBHD is unquestionable.

 As anticipated, Poincaré derives from (36) a new demonstration of the Third Fun-

 damental Theorem of Lie. He clearly states that to form a transformation group with
 prescribed structure constants, the following chain of constructions suffices (Poincaré
 1900, p. 234):

 1 . Given the structure constants, the process of reducing any polynomial into a sym-

 metric one follows;

 2. this allows for construction of the regular polynomials W(p , m, n)'
 3. from the latter, one obtains W' ;

 4. W' enables us to build up the functions Wk = (pic(v , t) such that W = X * wk Xk>
 V = X* VkXk, T = ^ tkXk do satisfy eveT = ew , a consequence of (36);

 5. the map vr = <p(v, t) provides the desired group.

 It is interesting to have an overview of Poincaré's analytic solution of Campbell's
 Problem (36). A detailed description is beyond our scope here; we confine ourselves
 to exhibiting some formulas, which will eventually return in the literature devoted to
 the CBHD Formula.

 Once again, Poincaré's ideas are destined to leave their marks: he is the first to
 characterize the solution W of ew - ev eT as solving a suitable ODE, which he also

 writes down explicitly. For instance, he proves that eve^T = ew ^ if and only if W(ß)
 solves

 Poincaré (1900, equation (7) on p. 248). If V, T are elements of the Lie algebra
 span{Xi, . . . , Xr} sufficiently near the origin, then W := W(l) is the solution to

 ew = eveT , an identity in the enveloping algebra of g. This identity translates into an

 identity between the operators e v , eT , ew , which solves (at the same time) Campbell's
 Problem and the Second and Third Fundamental Theorems of Lie.

 In many later proofs of the CBHD Theorem, formal power series of adjoint maps

 will frequently occur. But instead of analytically defining <p (Ad W ) by means of power

 series,23 Poincaré prefers to invoke the residue calculus. This also gives him the pos-

 sibility to make explicit that W(ß) is a linear combination of the Xf s. Indeed, by the
 cited use of the residue calculus, Poincaré is able to show that the (unique) solution
 W(ß) of (38) can be found in the form X/=i wi(ß) where

 dwj(ß) = J_ f Hrj='tj Ï

 dß = liïij det(Ad(W(j8))-Ç) 1 - e~$

 and that these ODEs can be integrated. Here i is the imaginary unit, the constants tj

 are the coefficients of T with respect to {Xi , . . . , Xr}, whereas (Pij) is the adjugate
 matrix (i.e., transpose of the cofactor) of Ad (W(ß)) - §, so that

 (Ad (W(ß)) - È)~] =

 det(Ad(W(/3))-Ç)

 The integral is taken over a contour around OeC which does not contain the poles of

 0 (z) , for example a circle about 0 of radius R < 2n . (Roughly speaking, the smallness
 of V, T reflects in the smallness of the eigenvalues of Ad W(ß) up to ß - 1, which
 in its turn ensures that the zeroes of det (Ad (W(ß)) - £)are surrounded by the cited
 contour.)

 Poincaré arrives at his ODE formulation (38) of Campbell's Problem by using a

 mixture of different techniques: his process of symmetrization of polynomials in the

 enveloping algebra, differential calculus, explicit computations of non-commutative
 algebra, etc. For example, a key role is played by Eq. (7) in Poincaré (1900, p. 244),
 stating (in symbolic notation)

 i _p-Ad(aV)
 gaV+ßW = gaVeßY > where y = J_f i _p-Ad(aV)

 As we shall see, similar computations will return in Pascal, in Hausdorff and in plenty
 of modern proofs of the CBHD Theorem (see e.g., Djokovic 1975).

 It seems that Poincaré's contribution to the Exponential Theorem has shared the
 same fate as his contribution to the Birkhoff-Witt Theorem: both have been ignored

 for several decades. A full recovery of his idea in obtaining an explicit formula for the

 CBHD series from (34) would probably deserve a further investigation.

 6 Pascal's contribution

 In a series of five papers dated during 1901-1902 (and in the monograph Pascal 1903),

 Pascal24 undertook the study of the composition of two exponentials, motivated by the
 search for new proofs of the Second and Third Fundamental Theorems of Lie. Here

 we give a brief overview of these papers, planning to return to this subject (with more

 mathematical content) in a forthcoming study.25

 In Pascal (1901a), he announces a new proof of the Second Theorem of Lie: in
 his opinion, Lie's original proofs are too indirect to be considered definitive, and he

 expresses the aim to find the most direct proof as possible "at the cost of longer com-

 putations' ' (he will be eventually faulted by Hausdorff (1906), and by Engel reviewing
 Pascal 1902c, for these long calculations). Pascal understood from the beginning that
 the crucial tool was the study of the product of two finite transformations, under the
 canonical exponential form x etX(x).

 With this aim in mind, Pascal (1901a) provides suitable identities occurring among

 the symbols of the finite transformations. Actually, all his computations are indepen-

 dent of any transformation group context and apply unaltered to indeterminates in any
 associative, non-commutative algebra. By means of the sole relation

 where k e IN and the numbers y ^ are universal constants inductively defined by

 ym = I, rw = _ ( I, yu-n + i, yu-» + . . + j, r< « + ^ y«)). (42,

 These kinds of formulas involved in the Exponential Theorem were not new at the time.

 The same formulas appeared, a few years before, in Campbell (1897a, p. 381), but the
 scalar coefficients involved in this paper were defined by a very different recursion
 formula, so that Campbell's and Pascal's arguments are indeed independent. More-

 over, we explicitly remark that the sum in parentheses in (41 ) belongs to the symmetric
 algebra of the vector space spanned by the brackets of X', X2, so that (41) is actu-
 ally a decomposition analogous to those studied by Poincaré (one year before Pascal)
 in defining the universal enveloping algebra.26 Furthermore, Pascal's constants

 are strongly related to the Bernoulli numbers, previously used by Schur, but Pascal's
 derivation of the role of the yW' s is clearly independent of Schur's.27

 In his article (1901b), Pascal gives the application of his former symbolic identities
 to the study of the Second Fundamental Theorem of Lie. Indeed, he undertakes the

 study of an explicit formula for eXl oeXl , aiming to obtain the infinitesimal transforma-

 tion X3 generating this product. Pascal's point of view is very clear and incisive: in the

 opening of the paper, he says that a formula for X3 provides, " as a uniquely compre-
 hensive source ," many applications to Lie group theory, such as the Second Theorem,

 the study of the permutability of one-parameter groups and the problem of the iso-
 morphism of transformation groups (these applications are given in the subsequent
 paragraphs of Pascal 1901b).

 26 Pascal seemed to ignore, at the time, the paper by Poincaré (1900); it will be Engel, in his review of
 Pascal's subsequent paper (1901b), who points out the analogy with Poincaré's study. Admittedly, Pascal's
 technique is quite different from Poincare's, and his computations, though heavier, are more explicit.

 27 Schur's discovery of the role of Bernoulli numbers within the study of the Exponential Theorem will by
 cited by Pascal only after his paper (Pascal 1902a). It holds that, as Pascal will point out in the same article,

 y<°> r = l /!>=-! y y<2"+D=0 v(2">=(-l)«+> r ÜÜL,

 where the numbers #2« defined by the following generating function:

 With our notation for Bn, Pascal's constants are nothing but - the same constants that appeared
 in Campbell but with a different recursion definition.

 322 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 Some remarks are in order. Pascal's awareness of the reach of his result is enthusi-

 astically affirmed, but he fails to refer to Campbell's earlier investigations and, mostly,
 to those by Poincaré. The analogy with Poincaré's point of view (recognizing the

 Exponential Theorem as a unifying tool) is evident, but there is no way of knowing if
 Pascal knew Poincaré's paper (1900) at the time.

 It will be Engel in his review of Pascal (1901b), who points out the analogy with

 Poincaré (1900) and, most importantly, underlines a fault in Pascal's paper: the con-
 vergence of the series expressing X3 in terms of Xj, X2 is lacking. This makes it
 impossible to apply Pascal's result directly. Even if Engel's words sound quite hard,28
 he acknowledges that Pascal's formula is very remarkable.

 Therefore, let us consider Pascal's argument in detail. He decomposes the product

 yr r

 rl Tj~ (k - r)!

 r" Tj~ (k - r)! Tï (0 < r < *, k e IN)

 as a linear combination of certain symmetric sums (called elementary of order k,k -

 1 , k - 2, . . .) based on X' , X2 and scalar products of nested commutators of the form:

 [XhXi2 • • • XisXiX2] := [Xh, [Xi2 • • • [Xis, [Xlt X2]] •••]], (43)

 where i', . . . , is e {1,2}. The law of composition of the scalar coefficient of such

 an elementary sum is described very closely, though an explicit formula is not given.

 xr x^~r

 Pascal states that the cited decomposition of ^ztjt can be obtained by an inductive
 argument deriving from the identities in his former paper (1901a). (Actually, we think
 that this point deserves more detail.)

 With this decomposition at hand, he rewrites the product:

 (t'X2 )j (tX')1 -y / ^ ,r k-r ^2 X' ' '
 ào /! -y h'h ,r ^ (* -»■)'/•

 For instance, his "semi-explicit" form of the coefficients of the elementary sums allows

 him to illustrate that the above sums in parentheses reconstruct into a pure exponential:

 00 1 k

 k= 0 '

 28 Engel says that Pascal's application to the Second Fundamental Theorem is "devoid of any foundation"

 if the proof of the convergence is missing, and he faults Pascal for "surprisingly omitting to ask himself the

 question." Engel also reveals that Lie himself had calculated the first six terms of this series, but then he gave
 up the study of this series for "he did not foresee any means of answering the question of convergence."

 where the coefficients y ^ are as in (42). Note the similarity with Poincaré's decom-

 p= 0 y p'

 (44)

 Exactly like Poincaré, when he stated that W' can be constructed by means of the
 reduction of to a regular polynomial, Pascal writes that the determination of X3
 follows by means of his universal decomposition (treated in Pascal 1901a and Pascal
 1901b, §1). Nonetheless, whereas Poincaré uses an a posteriori argument to prove
 equality (44) (by showing that W' satisfies a suitable system of ODEs), Pascal's con-
 struction is much more direct: as he announced, at the cost of onerous computations,

 he provides a direct way to reconstruct the product e 1 X2etXl as an exponential ex 3,

 this reconstruction being uniquely based on an unraveling of y ^ - jp- .

 For instance, his method permits him to exhibit the following terms:

 X3 = tX' + t'X2 + ymtt'[X UX2]

 +Ymt2t'[XyX 1X2] - y(2V2 [X2XiX2] - y(2)y(1)rV2 [X]X2XiX2]
 +y(3)fY[XiXiXiX2] - y(3)«'3[X2X2X1X2] + • • • (45)

 Since y(l) = -1/2, y{2> = 1/12, and y (3' = 0, we recognize the first few terms
 of the CBHD series. Besides this partial expansion, Pascal proves that X3 is a series
 of terms as in (43). As we remarked, Poincaré did not manage to prove this result

 explicitly. It was Campbell who stated a similar fact, but with a completely different
 technique.

 Finally, in Pascal (1901b, §2) Pascal gives the following proof of Lie's Second
 Theorem. (As Engel pointed out, the convergence of the series for X3 is needed to
 make the argument valid.) Let Z', . . . , Zr be infinitesimal transformations, and set
 V := span{Zi , . . . , Zr }; he aims to find the necessary and sufficient conditions for
 the above X3 to belong to V, whenever X', X2 do. Obviously, if [ Zh , Z^] e V for
 every h, k , then X', X2 € V implies X3 g V, since the summands in X3 are all of
 the form (43). Vice versa, if Xi, X2, X3 e V , then X3 - tX' - tX 2 e V for every

 (small) t. By the expansion in (45) up to degree 2 in X' , X2 jointly, this gives

 V 3YWt2 [Xi,X2] + ^o(î3).

 If we divide by t2 and we let t -> 0, then we get [Xi , X2] G V. Since we can take any
 Zh , Zk in place of Xi, X2, this gives [ Zh , Z&] G V , and Lie's Second Fundamental
 Theorem follows.

 The paper (Pascal 1902a) is completely devoted to some first and second degree
 identities concerning the Bernoulli numbers. With a considerable amount of computa-
 tions (showing his expertise in handling special functions), Pascal provides identities
 involving the numbers and the products y^y^' These identities will be helpful

 in his new concern: to prove Lie's Third Theorem with a direct approach, similar to
 the one that he followed to prove the Second Theorem. At last, in the incipit of the
 paper, Pascal cites Schur (1890a) (for the discovery of the roles of Bernoulli numbers

 in the study of the infinitesimal transformations of the so-called parameter group) and
 Campbell (1897a, 1898) for "certain formulas on the infinitesimal transformations,
 derived with different methods." He seems not to attribute to Campbell any effective
 discovery on the Exponential Theorem (this was the same attitude as Poincaré's and
 Hausdorff's).

 A certain reluctance in quoting other authors is manifestly shown in the way Pascal

 mentions the contributions by Schur and by Poincaré to the Third Theorem: for exam-

 ple, he simply says that Poincaré had "recently studied this problem," but no reference
 of any work is provided. [It is evident that, even supposing that Pascal got to know
 Poincaré's work only after the article (Pascal (1901b)), a comparison with (Poincaré
 (1900)) was now obligatory.]

 The study of Lie's Third Theorem is taken up in Pascal (1902b). This time the quo-
 tation of previous works is more accurate: he mentions Schur's contributions (1890a;
 1890b; 1893) as "extended and important;" he also briefly quotes Poincaré's recent
 studies (1899; 1900) as "starting from different points of view."

 The paper is devoted to explicitly constructing the infinitesimal transformations of a

 transformation group , provided constants Cijk are given, satisfying (10). He acknowl-
 edges the similarity with Schur's papers, but he stresses that his own method "is based

 to a large extent on some identities on Bernoulli numbers" as provided in the article
 (Pascal 1902a), "without any notion of group theory other than the Second Funda-
 mental Theorem." (We agree with Pascal in observing that, even if Schur's methods
 could be considered direct as well, they require a more overt use of the theory of
 transformation groups and ODEs.)

 After two long sections of laborious computations of identities involving the con-

 stants cijk and the proof of the Third Theorem is given as follows. Let u ' , . . . , ur
 be coordinates on some neighborhood of 0. Consider the following vector field:

 Uk ■=^(Shk-YW^ctlkhuH +^y(2n)

 where 8hk is Kronecker's symbol (the above is Eq. (16) in Pascal 1902b, p. 428). Then

 Pascal proves (this time with a very accurate estimate) that the above power series con-
 verges on some neighborhood of 0, so that U' , . . . , Ur are well defined. Furthermore,

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 325

 holds true, so that (by Lie's Second Theorem) the infinitesimal transformations Uk

 generate a group of transformations with structure constants Cijk. Identity (47) is
 proved by means of the computations of the previous sections of the paper, together

 with those in another (Pascal 1902a). We explicitly note the similarity with the results
 obtained by Schur: see (12) and (13).

 Pascal returns to the above argument in Pascal (1902c). Probably aware of the simi-

 larity of his results if compared to Schur's, in Pascal (1902c) he seizes the opportunity

 to show that the vector fields in (46) can be derived from his own previous purely
 algebraic results. Accidentally, he also exhibits the fact that Schur's explicit formulas

 can be derived by the Exponential Theorem, thus unveiling the precursory merits of
 Schur's study for the later CBHD Theorem.

 Indeed, the paper (Pascal 1902c) must be considered as the summa of Pascal's
 works on the theory of transformation group (later collected in the monograph Pascal
 1903), because:

 - he only uses his original algebraic identities in Pascal (1901a) (in neat difference

 with Schur's methods);

 - by means of these identities, he provides the explicit expression of suitable coeffi-
 cients in the expansion (45), thus improving the results in Pascal (1901b) (as Haus-

 dorff will later discover with different techniques, these crucial coefficients are those

 appearing in Campbell's series (16), and Pascal gives the expression of precisely
 these ones);

 - he constructs, with a more natural method when compared to Pascal (1902b), the

 infinitesimal transformations of the so-called parameter group (this time using some

 group prerequisites).

 The paper (Pascal 1902c) contains the most important of Pascal's contributions to the
 CBHD Theorem, and (as we shall discuss below) many of his computations will return

 as crucial tools in Baker and in Hausdorff (but without any acknowledgement of this

 fact by these authors).

 Therefore, let us briefly give an overview of the key results in Pascal (1902c). In
 Sect. 1 Pascal corrects a mistake from his paper (1902b) (the same mistake occurred
 also in Poincaré (1900); it will return again in Baker (1905)): If T, S are, respectively,
 the finite transformations

 then the composition S oT of S after T admits the correct expansion:

 T: x' =e''xHx)
 S: x"=etXi(x'),

 etxloet'x2= y i.

 This shows that some care must be taken in passing from finite transformations of

 exponential type to the symbolic exponential calculus.

 Again from transformation group theory, it is known that (50) defines a finite group

 of transformations, called the parameter group.

 Now, thanks to the formula for the product of two exponentials, one can find all of

 the functions <ph. Pascal remarks that, if we know that (50) defines a transformation

 group, it is sufficient to consider only the terms containing v with degree one (which

 furnish, ipso facto, the infinitesimal transformations): these correspond to the sum-
 mands in (45) with t having degree one. By formula (49) (plus a summand from (48))

 In view of the above explicit formula for the infinitesimal transformations £/*, this

 identity contains a very "quantitative" version of the Third Fundamental Theorem,
 in that it shows that an explicit transformation group can be constructed by the use

 of the Bernoulli numbers y ^ and by a set of constants cijk satisfying the structure
 relations (10). This fact was not new at the time, in view of Schur's former studies,

 but the way it is derived is indeed new: this is done by the use of Pascal's version of
 the Exponential Theorem.

 Pascal's contribution to the development of the CBHD Theorem is paramount: in

 modern parlance, we can say that he has shown for the first time how to construct an

 explicit (transformation) group by using the CBHD series

 X o Y = X + Y + i [X, Y] + [X, [X, Y]] - ± [Y, [X, /]] + •••

 associated to X and Y , or, more precisely, by using the subseries extracted from X o Y

 of the summands of degree one in one of the indeterminates X or Y . Analogous results
 will be re-obtained by Baker and, mostly, by Hausdorff, and will reappear in more
 modern proofs of the CBHD Theorem; see Reutenauer (1993, Sect. 3.4).

 7 Baker's contribution

 Preceded by a series of papers (Baker 1901, 1902, 1903) mostly concerned with expo-

 nential-type theorems in the context of transformation groups and groups of matrices,

 Baker30 devoted an important paper (1905) to the Exponential Theorem for abstract
 non-commutative indeterminates.

 His words speak very clearly: "It is an obvious suggestion of Lie's theory of groups

 that the product eAeB is of the form ec , where C is a series of alternants (i.e., brackets)
 of A and /?." His aim is to prove this fact by a method "of the kind usually called
 symbolical," in order to provide "a contribution to the calculus of alternants of any
 non-commutative quantities."

 As a connection, he cites Campbell's proof in Campbell (1898, 1903) as "an ele-

 mentary proof" of the symbolic theorem, though he considers this proof as not fi-
 nal. Later, he provides an application of his Exponential Theorem to Lie's Second
 Theorem, Baker (1905, p. 44) saying that an analogous approach was "in view" in
 Campbell's paper (1898). Nothing is said about Campbell's technique and no men-
 tion at all is made of Poincaré's related results nor of Pascal's. Schur is luckier; he is

 acknowledged for his study of the parameter group and (see Baker 1905, p. 26) for
 his explicit formulas exhibiting a transformation group with given structure constants.
 Baker states that by means of his own Exponential Theorem, he can recover Schur's

 explicit group. Actually, this fact was already pointed out and proved in detail by

 Pascal (but Baker gives no reference of this fact, probably being unaware of that paper
 Pascal 1902c).

 Baker's words celebrate the Exponential Theorem (incidentally, he is seemingly
 the first one to use this expression; see the title of his paper (1901) and that of §3 in

 his paper (1905)) as a universal tool in giving "the parameter group of every possible
 continuous group." As a matter of fact, he was preceded in this intuition by all his
 predecessors: Schur (implicitly), Poincaré, Pascal, and Campbell.

 The first palpable novelty of Baker's approach is to allow consideration of symbol-

 ical expressions of the form:

 (eAeB - 1) - i ( eAeB - l)2 + 1 ( eAeB - l)3 - • • • (51)

 This is the first time that a genuine logarithm , namely 'og(eAeB - 1), makes its explicit
 appearance in the proof of the Exponential Theorem. This is possible because Baker
 considers A and B as pure "non-commutative quantities," as he defines them. In the

 second page of his paper, we also find the explicit expansion of the above series up to
 the fourth order31 :

 30 Henry Frederick Baker; Cambridge (England), 1866-1956.

 We henceforth denote Baker's alternants (A, B) with the usual [A, B]; also, although Baker never used

 this notation, we also allow ourselves to use adjoint maps like Ad A, Ad B, . . . with the usual meaning.

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 329

 A + B+l-[A,B] + ^[A- B, [A, B]] - ± [A, [B, [A, B]]]. (52)

 Then, Sect. 1 is devoted to introducing a certain formalism concerned with bracketing.

 At a first reading this formalism looks puzzling and mystifying.32 Baker intends it to

 simplify computations with brackets, in that it comprises many identities resulting

 from skew-symmetry and Jacobi identities. Let us take a look at this formalism, which

 Baker describes rather than rigorously defines.

 If capitals A, B, C, . . . denote elements of some associative but non-commuta-
 tive algebra,33 Baker associates to each of them a lower-case a,b,c, ... The pairing
 A o a is injective and linearly extended, and a is called the base of A , whereas
 A is called the derivative of a. He uses the notation e to mean the map defined

 by

 ea := A, where a is the base of A.

 He then proposes to define the base of any element in the Lie algebra generated by cap-
 itals. He begins with nested brackets (called "simple alternants"): the base of [A, B ]

 is denoted by Ab , whence skew-symmetry imposes the identities

 Ab + Ba = 0, Aa = 0. (53)

 Moreover, if d = Be is the base of [ B , C], the base of [A, [ B , C]] has to be Ad, also

 denoted by A Be. Accordingly,

 A' A2 . . . Anb denotes the base of [A', [A2 • • • [A„, B] • • • ]].

 This notation is not ambiguous because of the associativity of composing adjoint maps,

 which Baker summarizes by saying that in the product A 1 A2 . . . Anb "the symbols are
 associative." The next task is to define the base of a non-simple bracket (called "com-

 pound alternant"), for example of D := [[A, B], C]. Since, by skew-symmetry, this
 equals - [C, [A, 5]], we expect d to be -CAb. But the Jacobi identity also imposes
 that D = [A, [ B , C]] + [ B , [C, A]], so that we must also have d = ABc + BCa. This

 provides the identity, which substitutes for Jacobi 's,

 ABc + BCa + CAb = 0. (54)

 32 In reviewing Baker (1905), Engel says that this formalism has the effect of making "a little heavier the

 understanding" of the contents; then, with harder words, Engel says that Baker's use of bases and derivatives
 is definitely a ziemlich überflüssige Einführung, a quite superfluous introduction.

 33 Apparently, Baker fixes some letters defining what we would call an algebra of words, which is associa-
 tive but not commutative. He never clarifies which is the basis of this algebra, so that his further constructions

 may be in contrast with possible linear dependence relations.

 330 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 Baker goes on with other delicate identities concerning bases and derivatives, proving

 that his symbols obey some natural associative and distributive laws.34 As he declares,

 the use of bases and derivatives "furnishes a compendious way of expressing the rela-

 tions among alternants." In fact, as (53)-(54) show, Baker's symbolic technicalities
 summarize the basic relations existing in a Lie algebra and furnish new ones: for
 example, from (53) with A = [ B , C], one gets [ B , C]Bc = 0; the associative and dis-
 tributive laws then give BCBc - CB2c = 0; finally, by applying the map 6, we derive

 [£, [C, [ B , C]]] - [C, [Ä, [ B , C]]] = 0.

 Furthermore, Baker also allows the basic laws of algebra to continue to hold for

 formal power series constructed with his symbols. For example, the derivative of

 c = (Zi^oÀ<- A') b is

 C = ^À,(AdA)'(B),

 00

 *=0

 i=0

 C = 2>,(AdA)''(ß).

 and if Ào #0 and XSo ^ *s ^ f°rmal power series reciprocal to the series

 xi > then b = (Z£o M/ A1) c so that

 A more delicate topic is the so-called "substitutional operation" treated in Sect. 2.

 This same operation will return in Hausdorff 's paper with no mention of Baker's prior

 study (of which Hausdorff was probably unaware). Let us summarize it.

 Given bases A, B with derivatives a , b , the symbol b ^ defines the operation

 replacing a and A by b and B (respectively) one at a time. For example

 (b ^ A2Ca = BACa + ABCa + A2Cb.

 In practice, Baker is defining a sort of mixed algebra-derivation , operating both on
 bases and derivatives.35 As a first main result on substitutions, he takes any B =

 (2/2:0 A1 ) C, and he considers the formal power series in the real number t given by

 34 For example, he provides a "distributive law": Let A = [A i , • • • [An_i , An] • • • ] be expanded in the
 form, A = J) ±K' ...Kn (where the K' s are permutations of the A 's). Then he proves that

 [A, B] = [£ ±Ki . . . Kn, ß] = £ ±[K I , [K2 ■ ■ ■ IK„, B] ■ ■ ■ ]],

 so that (X ± ATi . . . K„) b = X ±(K , . . . K„b).

 35 Since it is never made clear which capitals are generators of the whole algebra of capital letters, the
 well-posedness of this derivation is not so obvious.

 We explicitly remark that Baker proves it when b = Ac, and then he asserts (without

 proof) that the same holds true for any arbitrary b.

 With these lemmas at hand, Baker (1905, §3) proves his "Exponential Theorem."

 The proof is the following one. Let us apply (58) when 0 (A) = eA = XSo ^ 1 / 1 ••
 this case, (/>V'A ) = eA for every j > 0 so that (58) gives

 (b^jeA = f (Ad A)(B)eA, (59)

 is the very notable identity (analogous to the formula for the differential of the expo-

 A' = / (Ad A)(B). (61)

 If we now apply (57) with t - 1 and il j = '/j ' (together with the latter representation

 Thus, the Exponential Theorem is proved once A " in (64) is known to be a Lie series

 in A, A! . But this is true since A!' is the derivative of an infinite sum of bases, namely

 Gathering together (60), (64), and (65), Baker has proved the following remarkable
 formula

 In confirmation of the computational power of his calculus on bases/derivatives, Baker

 obtains (in a few lines) his fourth-order expansion (52), starting from the representa-
 tion of a" in (63). [Later, but with more elaborate calculations, he will also compute

 the sixth-order expansion; see Baker (1905, p. 42).] Finally, the last two sections of
 the paper are devoted to an application of the Exponential Theorem to transformation
 groups, and in particular to a proof of the Second Fundamental Theorem. Actually,
 Baker does not add too much to what Pascal (and Campbell) had already proved,
 nor does he consider in any case the problem of the convergence of the series he
 obtained.

 Though it is full of suggestions for the later history of the CBHD Theorem (indeed

 Reutenauer 1993 has provided a proof of this theorem which fully formalizes Baker's

 computations), in reading Baker's proof one inevitably has the feeling that the really
 important ideas are lost somewhere in the tricky formalism. Hausdorff's argument,
 which we now turn to analyze, will fill all the gaps.

 8 Hausdorff's contribution

 Hausdorff37 devoted a single paper (Hausdorff 1906) to what he defined, in the title

 of the paper, "the symbolic Exponential Formula in group theory." Despite the men-
 tion of the theory of transformation groups, his point of view is made clear from

 the incipit of the paper: "a considerable part of the group theory is completely inde-

 pendent of the actual meaning of the symbols involved" [those of the infinitesimal
 transformations]. For instance, not even the Jacobi identity depends on the fact that

 one is dealing with infinitesimal transformations, but only on the form of the bracket

 [ X , Y ] = XY - Y X 38 Therefore, he proposes to study the function z = z(x, y) defined

 by the formal identity exey = ez, a problem of "symbolic analysis," as he defines it.

 In the foreword of his paper, Hausdorff provides a brief review of the work of his

 predecessors. We already mentioned his point of view on Schur, Poincaré, and Pascal.
 Let us examine what he says about Campbell and Baker. Campbell is acknowledged

 as the first who "attempted" to give a proof of the Second Theorem of Lie with the

 aid of a symbolic Exponential Theorem, providing the summands of degree one with

 respect to y in the expansion of z(x, y) (in Hausdorff's subsequent notation, x ( y , x)).

 Hausdorff's opinion is that Campbell's prolongation of the expansion of the whole z
 (besides the summands in x(y, x)) "is based on a passage to the limit not completely
 clear nor simple."

 Even if more than one year elapsed between the two papers,39 Hausdorff does not

 mention Baker's paper (1905), and the only reference is to Baker's paper (1901) as
 containing "some stimulating ideas on the use of matrices in group theory." There is

 evidence that Hausdorff actually did not know Baker's 1905 paper at the time he pub-

 lished his 1 906 manuscript.40 We will point out every intersection of the two papers
 in due course.

 37 Felix Hausdorff; Breslau (Prussia; now Wroclaw, Poland) 1868 - Bonn (Germany), 1942.

 38 Hausdorff used the notation ( X , Y) = XY - YX for alternants; consistent with the rest of the paper, we
 use the usual notation [ X , Y].

 39 Baker's front page contains the dates "Received January 8, 1905 - Read January 12, 1905," whereas
 Hausdorff's last page contains the wording "ready for printing February 25, 1906" (literally: Druckfertig
 erklärt 25.11. 1906.).

 40 In reviewing Baker's paper (1905), Engel says that "Baker's work, which had escaped Hausdorff, con-
 tains a very essential part" [literally, einen sehr wesentlichen Teil ] "of the results found by Hausdorff."
 According to Scharlau (. Kommentar , in Hausdorff 2001, p. 464), it was Engel who informed Hausdorff of
 Baker's paper. In a letter dated March 9, 1907, Hausdorff wrote back to him: "Following your creditable
 advice, I have promptly looked at the work by H.F. Baker and sadly noticed that its content really overlaps
 my work in large part. Evidently the problem has been hanging in the air, since in the last years it has
 been picked up and solved, with more or less skillfulness, by Campbell, Pascal, Poincaré, Baker; but it is
 especially Baker's last work - the only one that remained quite unknown to me - that has the most contact
 with mine. By the way, if I had known it then, I would have published my work nonetheless, albeit with
 somewhat muted joy, for if compared to all the others, including Baker, it was me who had found the sim-
 plest and most transparent proof." [Engel Legacy, Mathematical Institute of Giessen University.] Scharlau

 furthermore notes that, when Hausdorff was writing to Engel, he had already finished the investigation of

 the Exponential Formula, for Hausdorff finishes the letter with the words: "Recently, I have been studying
 set theory only, [...]."

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 335

 Sections 1 and 2 of Hausdorff (1906) are devoted to describing the necessary alge-

 braic structures and the main operation involved u-^, the same as Baker used. If we

 use modern parlance, Hausdorff in fact introduces the following structures41 :

 Lo this is the associative algebra (over R or C) of the polynomials P in a finite set of

 non-commuting symbols je, y, z, w, . . .; the "dimension" of P is the least of the
 degrees of its monomials.

 L this is the associative algebra of the formal power series associated to Lo; any infi-

 nite sum is allowed, provided it involves summands with different (hence increas-
 ing) dimensions.

 Ko this is the Lie subalgebra of Lo of Lie polynomials in the basis symbols x9 y ,

 z,u, ...

 K this is the Lie subalgebra of L of Lie series associated to Ko.

 Then Hausdorff considers the important operation on L acting as follows: if F g L is

 momentarily thought of as a function of the basis symbol x , and m is a new symbol,
 we have the "Taylor expansion":

 F(x + u) = F(x) + F(x) + ^ F(x)+

 (67)

 where (u F (x) is the sum of the summands of F (x + u) containing u precisely
 n times, or equivalently it denotes the action on F(x) of the n- fold composition of the

 operator u ^ with itself, where u ^ is the derivation of L mapping x to u and leaving
 all the other basis symbols unchanged. Even if Baker never wrote down Hausdorff 's

 distinguished expansion (67), the operator u ^ is precisely Baker's "substitutional
 operation" introduced (within the study of the symbolic Exponential Theorem) one
 year before (see §2 of Baker 1905, p. 31).

 For example, if F = Fq + F* + F£ H

 one has

 foe) F(x) = F' 2 F% + • • • + n F* + • • • . (68)

 An expansion as in (67) holds true even if u is any element of L, provided that the
 actual value of u (possibly depending on jc) is substituted in the right-hand side of (67)

 after the symbolic operations (u are carried out. From (67) and the commutativity
 of u and v one also obtains

 F(x + u, y + v) = F(x, y) + V" - j [u - 0 + v - £ ) F(x,y). (69)

 41 Lacking of a notion of associative or Lie algebra, any of his structure is generically defined as "Körper."

 In order to preserve many of Hausdorff 's elegant formulas, we shall use the following

 notation for left-nested iterated brackets:

 336 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 [xy] = [x,y], [xyz] = [[x,y],z], [xyzu] = [[[x,y], z],u], ... (70)

 It is then proved in detail that left-nested brackets of basis elements span all Ko,
 whereas series of such brackets span K. Also, if F (jc) is a Lie series in jc, y, z, . . .,

 then ( u F(x ) is a Lie series in u , jc, y, z, . . . (in modern parlance, an algebra der-
 ivation is also a Lie algebra derivation).

 With only these few prerequisites, Sect. 3 is devoted to the proof of Hausdorff's

 main result (Hausdorff 1906, Proposition B, p. 29), which is the announced symbolic
 Exponential Theorem: The function z of x, y defined by exey = ez can be represented

 as an infinite series whose summands are obtained from x and y by bracket operations,

 times a numerical factor. Let us analyze Hausdorff's argument and compare it with
 the proofs of his predecessors.

 We are allowed to say that z = z(x, y) is a function of jc, y for in the algebra L the

 logarithm makes sense (see also Baker's (51)), so that

 z = t - ' t2 ~ '

 We aim to prove that the above z actually belongs to K, not only to L.

 Since ( u ex = X«Li h. 2^=o xluxn~l~l, the substitution u = [ w , jc] gener-

 ates a telescopic sum, so that

 Furthermore Hausdorff provides two other well-known formulas of non-commutative
 algebra42 (see also the notation in (70)):

 42 The formulas (72) and (73) also appear in Campbell (1897a, pp. 387, 386) and in Baker (1905, pp. 34,
 38).

 We explicitly remark that identity (75) was already discovered by Baker (see (59)).
 Note that the above identities also hold true when u = x, for cp(x, x) = 'jr(x, x) = x

 An analogous formula (together with the inner factor (- 1 )n~ 1 ) with ex as a right factor

 holds true. This gives the following results:

 then (p and can be rewritten as

 (p(u, x) = h(Adx)(u), 'fr(u, x) = h(-Adx)(u). (76)

 Furthermore, from (76), we get the inversion formulas:

 p = <p(u,x ) & u = x(p,x),

 q = i/r(w, x) u=a)(q,x ),

 where

 i /

 and we see how the Bernoulli numbers step in.43 Note that

 X(/?, x) = g(Adx)(/?), co(q, x) = g(-Adx)(q).

 338 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 Now, identities (74) and (75) and the expansion (67) give the following important
 formulas (observe that <p(-, x) and i/r(-, x) are linear)

 For example, thanks to the inversion formulas (77), the choices

 ex+au = a (p(u , x) + ^(a2)), (79)
 x) + û(a2)) ex , (80)

 holding true for every m of the form [wx] (the choice w = 1 is also allowed) and every
 scalar a 44 We point out that a proof of (79) (with no hypothesis on u) is contained
 in Poincaré (1900, pp. 244, 245) (see indeed the computation in (40)), but Hausdorff
 does not mention it, though he knew Poincaré's paper very well.

 At this point, Hausdorff's argument becomes less than completely transparent: he

 states that it is possible to leave z unchanged in exey = ez by adding au to x and by
 accordingly adding to y a certain quantity - av + & (a2), so that identity

 ex+au ey-av+û(a2) _ ez

 also holds true, with z unaltered. We prefer to modify Hausdorff's non-obvious argu-

 ment in the following way (similar to what is done in Yosida's paper (1937)): let w, v

 be any pair of elements of L satisfying

 <p(u,x) = 1r(v,y), (81)

 and let z(a) be defined by

 £*(«) :z=ex+auey-av^ aeR

 (u = x, v - œ (x, >')) or (v = y, u = x(y,*)) (82)

 do satisfy (81). Suppose further that u and v are series of summands of type [wx], so

 that (79) and (80) apply.45 (Note that the m's and v's in (82) are of this form.) We thus
 have the following computation:

 ez(a) = gx ^ + a + _ a^(v> y) + 0(a2)) ey

 - ex ^1 + a(<p(u, x) - 'jr{v, y)) + ^(a2)) ey

 (= ex(l + û(a2))ey = exey(l + &(a2)).

 44 Hausdorff never again mentions the restriction on u to be of the form u = [wx]. Ipso facto, he will
 apply (79) and (80) when u is a series of summands of such form, so that this lack of mention is easily
 understood. However, it is a singular analogy that a similar fact occurred in Baker (1905, p. 34), who proved
 an analogue of (75) with a restrictive hypothesis similar to Hausdorff's u = [wx], and then Baker stated,
 without proof, that this restriction could be removed.

 45 Hausdorff fails to mention this hypothesis: this leads us to suppose that he retains (79) and (80) proved
 with no restriction on u.

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 339

 From the above expansion, it is easily derived that z(0) = 0. On the other hand, by
 applying the expansion (69) to F(x , y) := 'og(exey ), we get

 z(a) = F(x + a w, y - a v) = z(x, y)+a'u-

 /a a ' Ä 2
 ' dx dy )

 Hence i:(0) = 0 ensures that, for any m, v satisfying (81), z(x, y) = exey satisfies the
 following PDE (see Eq. (19) of Hausdorff 1906, p. 28):

 ("è)z=("i^)z (s3)

 We are thus allowed to make, for instance, the choices in (82) which, respectively,

 give

 (* à) z = y) è) (84)
 {y^)z = (x(y,x)^)z, (85)

 and each of these choices suffices to determine z. Indeed, by writing z = Zq + z* H
 (where the summands in z have been ordered with the increasing powers of x) and by

 using (68), Hausdorff derives from (84) the following remarkable formula (see Eqs.
 (22) and (23) of Hausdorff 1906, p. 29):

 zxn = ^ y) y, n > 0. (86)

 Here we have used the fact that the application of the operator co (x , y) ^ increments
 the degree in x by one unit. Analogously, from (85) one gets

 Z" = ni *' n~°' ^

 Since jc, y and co(x , y ), x(j, x) are all Lie series (see (78)), this proves that any of

 zxn, Zn is a Lie polynomial, and the Exponential Theorem is proved.

 From (86) and the definition of w(x, y), it follows that Hausdorff has proved the

 following result (note that [x y 2n] = (Ad y)2n(x))'

 with co(x, y) = x + ' Z [x, y] + y/ ^ B" (Ady)2n(x), (88)

 We explicitly remark that this is exactly Baker's formula (66), proved one year earlier.

 Despite the fact that Hausdorff was anticipated by Baker, his argument, free from

 the intricate formalism in Baker (1905), can easily be considered as the first totally
 transparent proof of the Exponential Theorem; furthermore, it has the merit of unit-
 ing contributions from his predecessors (some algebraic computations from Pascal
 and Campbell; Poincaré's technique of deriving ODEs for z(a); the use of Baker's
 substitutional operator) in a most effective way.

 In order to show the computational effectiveness of his recursion formulas (86) and

 (87), Hausdorff provides, with a single page of computations, the expansion of z up
 to order 5 (see the left-nested notation (70)):

 z = x + y + - [xy] + - [xyy] + - [yxx] + - [yxxy]

 1111

 "755 l'yyyy] - Sö l"""1 + 555 [xyyyx] + m [y'"n

 ~l'yyy1--^lyxyx] + -

 Furthermore, Hausdorff provides a new recursion formula, allowing one to obtain
 the homogeneous summands of z, ordered with respect to the joint degree in x, y.
 His argument is based on his previous techniques: this time, let z(ot) be defined by
 ez( a) _ ex+axey ^ so z ._ _ ex ey gy Taylor expansion (67), one has
 z(a) = z + öl (x z + Oia1). Hence, by (80),

 ez(a) = + û(a2)j ez .

 On the other hand, again by (80) applied to ex+ax, we infer

 ez(ot ) = ex+axey = _|_a '/r(x,x) + 0(a2)^ exey = (l+ax + ez.

 By comparing the above two expansions of ez , we derive x = x/s (jc ^ z, z) , so that,
 by the inversion formula (77) for t/t, we get

 Ix) z = (0^X, ^

 A dual argument for exey+ay yields another "PDE"

 (y-^>)z = x(y,z)- (90)

 This gives the remarkable formula (see Eq. (29) of Hausdorff 1906, p. 31):

 (* £*) Z + Z = ^ + X(X + y' Z ^ ^

 Inserting into (91) the expansion z = z',y + z^y + • • -, where z?ny has joint degree
 n in x, y, we obtain a recursion formula for the summands Zny which exhibits in

 a very limpid form their Lie-polynomial nature. This formula will return in modern
 proofs of the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff Theorem: (see Djokovic 1975; Varadarajan
 1984) and, as shown in Varadarajan (1984), it can be profitably used for convergence
 matters.

 From Sect. 4 onward, Hausdorff turns his attention to the applications of the sym-

 bolic Exponential Theorem to groups of transformations. Since he blamed his prede-

 cessors (in particular Pascal, who indeed got very close to proving a symbolic theorem)
 for omitting convergence matters, Hausdorff's main concern is to prove the conver-
 gence of at least one of his three series-expansions of z(x, y), for x and y near the

 origin.

 To this end, let t' , . . . , tr be a basis of a finite dimensional set of infinitesimal

 transformations,46 with structure constants given by [ tp , ta] = XI=i cpoxt'- Let x =

 Hp%PtP>y = Hp Vptp and suppose that the series z(x,y)= z" defined (87)

 converges to z = Xp It: must remarked that, in its turn, any zyn (with n > 1) is
 given by a series, convergence of which must be proved first. Hausdorff begins with
 the study of z' = x(y> *)• Suppose this converges to u = &ptp. By definition
 of u - x(y, x) and by inversion y = cp(u , x) (recalling (77)), we see that u depends
 linearly on y and so y depends linearly on u. Passing to the associated coordinates

 with respect to the basis {t' , . . . , tr], we infer the existence of two matrices:

 A(f) = («pa«)), V(|) = A(Ç)-1 = (W(§))>

 46 As can be seen, Hausdorff's argument works very well for any finite dimensional Lie algebra.

 such that ûa = Xp <*po(H) Vp and rjp = so that the identity u =
 X(y>x) gives us the compact relation:

 Hausdorff recognizes that this series had already been written by Schur (1890a,b), but

 he adds that it can be "elegantly rewritten" as follows (see Eq. ( 1 1 ) of Hausdorff 1 906,
 p. 34):

 This allows Hausdorff to obtain an explicit series for the functions otpo(%) and, con-

 sequently, for the functions ûp. To this end, let us introduce the structure matrix

 E(§) := (|p<r), where |pCT := ^cpxah-

 (This is nothing but the transpose matrix of the matrix representing the right-adjoint

 map Y i-> [ Y , ^ x §aAL) By means of the matrix 3, we can write down explicitly the

 left-nested brackets [tpxn]. This allows us to recognize that (92) is equivalent to

 i.e., A(|) = /( 3(D), where f(z) =

 It is now very simple to deduce from (93) a domain of convergence for the series

 expressing the functions apa(t;): if M is an upper bound for all the functions 't=pa |, it
 suffices to have r M < 2n, since the complex function f(z ) is holomorphic in the disk

 about 0 of radius 2n . This produces a domain of convergence for ^ p apo (£) rjp
 and hence of u = ^ p ûptp, which is the first summand x(j, x) in the expansion for
 z(x,y).

 Before passing to the convergence of the other summands and of the whole series

 of these summands, Hausdorff compares his matrix-calculus to Baker's (1901). Let
 us introduce the matrix

 According to Hausdorff, presumably unaware of Baker's paper (1905), this is "Baker's

 Hausdorff returns to the convergence matter in Sect. 6. This is his argument. He

 Hence, since it has already been proved that the maps apa are analytic in a neighbor-

 hood of the origin, the convergence of the functions Çp in (97) is a consequence of the
 general theory ofODEs. Note the similarity with Poincaré's convergence argument,
 see (38), (39).

 Furthermore, Hausdorff suggests an evocative way of interpreting his PDE-like

 operators: for instance,

 Finally, the above convergence result furnishes the proof of the transformation- group

 equations [tp, ta] = cpo't', by means of the Exponential Theorem

 vp fp = Çp tp ^

 the functions Çp = fp(£, rj) are well defined and analytic in a suitable neighborhood
 of$ = r) = 0.

 Section 7 is devoted to the derivation of the Second and Third Theorems of Lie by

 means of the above Proposition C. As a matter of fact, Hausdorff 's argument does not
 add too much to what his predecessors, from Poincaré to Baker, had said about the
 same topic.

 In closing this review about Hausdorff 's contribution to the Exponential Theorem,

 we quote his words (see Hausdorff 1906, p. 44): the symbolic Exponential Theorem

 "Proposition B is the nervus probandi of the fundamental theorems of group theory."
 An opinion shared, with the same fervor, by Poincaré and Pascal.

 9 Dynkin's contribution

 After Hausdorff 's 1906 paper, more than 40 years elapsed before the problem of pro-
 viding an explicit representation of the series log(exey) was solved. This question was
 first answered by Dynkin47 in his 1947 paper. In what follows, we will quote the 2000

 47 Eugene Borisovich Dynkin; Leningrad (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), 1924.

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 345

 English translation of the Russian paper (Dynkin 1947), contained in Dynkin (2000,
 pp. 31-34).

 Starting from what Dynkin calls "the theorem of Campbell and Hausdorff," i.e.,

 the result stating that log(exey) is a series of Lie polynomials in jc and y, formula (12)
 of Dynkin (2000) provides the following explicit representation (notations will be
 explained below), later known as Dynkin' s Formula (for the Campbell-Baker-Haus-
 dorff series)

 log(exey ) = V ' ^ k

 ' k p''q''p2m^--- Pk'qk' j

 (98)

 where the sum runs over k e IN and the non-vanishing couples with i =
 1, . . . , k. Most importantly, the map P '-> P°, which we now describe, is introduced,

 where P is any polynomial in a finite set of non-commuting indeterminates.

 In order to define the map P P°, let âê denote the (free) algebra of the polyno-
 mials in the non-commuting indeterminates x', . . . , xn over a field of characteristic
 zero. For P,Q e M, let [P, Q] = PQ - QP denote the usual commutator,48 and
 let be the least Lie subalgebra of M containing x' , . . . , xn. Finally, let us consider

 the unique linear map from M to mapping P = XixXi2 • • • x ik to P°, where

 P° = J [■ ■ ■ [[■*(, , Xi2', xh] ■ ■ ■ xk ].

 Then (see Theorem on page 32 of Dynkin 2000) Dynkin proves that

 Pef if and only if P = P°. (99)

 This theorem, later also referred to as the Dynkin-Specht-Wever Theorem (see also
 Specht 1948; Wever 1949), is one of the main characterizations of Lie polynomials.
 Dynkin's proof of the above theorem reads as follows. We only have to prove that
 P g implies P = P°, and it is non-restrictive to suppose that P is an ordered
 Lie-monomial, say P = [• • • 'x' , X2] • • -xm]. By expanding the brackets, we obtain
 uniquely determined scalars such that

 P = [•••[* 1, *2] •••*«]= 21 ah -im xh ' ' 'X'm> (10°)

 where I is any permutation of {1, ... , m}. Hence, by the very definition of P°,

 P° = X ~~ a,'i ["•foi' *<2] •••*««]• (101)

 48 Dynkin used the notation P o Q := P Q - QP; also o xl2 o • • • o xlk denotes the left-nested com-
 mutator (•••((* o Xi2) o Xi3 ) o • • • o xik ). We allowed ourselves to use the bracket notation, as in the rest
 of the paper.

 which starts with xk, namely x kXj2 • • • xjm : thus, comparing (100) and (102), we derive

 ckji"Jm = akj2-jm f°r every J as above, so that

 [mm'[X',X2 ]'''Xm'- ^ , akj2~jm [' ' ' [Xki Xj2^ ' ' ' Xjm]' (103)

 J=Ü2,-Jm)

 Being k e {1 , . . . , m] arbitrary, summing up we obtain

 mP=m[---[x ',X2'---Xm]- ^ aiii2_..im[---[xi1,xi2]---xim],
 I=(iui2,~>Jm)

 where I is as in (100). By comparing this identity to (101), we infer P = P°, and (99)

 is proved.

 With this result at hand, the derivation of the representation (98) is almost trivial.

 Indeed, the very definitions of log and exp give

 log(eV) = Z^ZT- ' k , , , '

 ' k p''q''p2m' , , , ' ' PMk'

 where the sum is as in (98). If we assume that the Exponential Theorem is satisfied

 (i.e., that the above series is indeed a Lie series in x and y ), an application of the map
 P h-> P° (naturally extended to series) leaves unchanged 'og(exey) so that (98) holds
 true.

 Other three fundamental results are contained in Dynkin's 1947 paper (see Dynkin

 2000, p. 34):

 1 . If K is R or C and g is any finite dimensional Lie algebra over K, then the series

 in the right-hand side of (98), say O0(jc, j), converges for every x, y in a neigh-
 borhood of 0 G g. Indeed, thanks to the very explicit expression of Dynkin's series ,

 the following direct computation holds: if || • || is any norm on g compatible with
 the Lie bracket,49 then

 (x^y^x^y^2 ■ ■ -xPkyqkf < ||;c||pl+™+w • ||y||«1+-+9t.

 49 This means that || [x , y] || < || jc || • || y || for every jc , y e g. Note that such a norm always exists, thanks to
 the continuity and bilinearity of (jc, y) h* [x, j] and the finite dimensionality of q.

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 347

 Consequently, as for the study of the absolute convergence of the series O0(jc, y),

 an upper bound is given by

 £ tltl (eMeM _ {jk = logCeMe'MI) = |W| + ||y|| < oo,

 k

 provided that ''x'' + ||y|| < log 2. As a matter of fact, this is the first argument in

 the history of the CBHD Theorem for a direct proof of the convergence problem , an

 argument much more natural and direct than those given by Poincaré, by Pascal, and

 even by Hausdorff (whose convergence- study was the most satisfactory, up to that

 time). Also, Dynkin's proof works for any finite dimensional Lie algebra , hence in

 particular for the algebra of the infinitesimal transformations of a transformation

 group, thus comprising all the related results obtained by his predecessors.

 2. The same arguments as above can be straightforwardly generalized to the so-called

 Banach-Lie algebras ,50 thus anticipating a newer research field. Dynkin will exten-

 sively return to this generalization in his paper (1950).

 3. Dynkin's series (98), together with the obvious (local) associativity of the (local)

 operation x * y := O0(jc, _y), allows one to attack the original version of Lie's Third

 Theorem (a concern for Schur, Poincaré, Pascal, and Hausdorff) in a very simple

 way: indeed * defines a local group on a neighborhood of the origin of every finite

 dimensional (real or complex) Lie algebra, with prescribed structure constants.

 As observed above, Dynkin proves a commutator-formula for 'og(exey) yet assuming

 its commutator-nature. Two years later, Dynkin (1949) will give another proof of the

 fact that 'og(exey) is a Lie series, completely independent of the arguments of his pre-

 decessors, and mainly based on his theorem (99) and on combinatorial computations.

 Quoting the words of Bose (1989, p. 2035), with respect to the recursive formulas for

 log(exey) proved by Baker and Hausdorff, "Dynkin radically simplified the problem,"
 by deriving "an effective procedure" for determining the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff

 series. Let us overview his new proof.

 Let K be a field of characteristic zero. We set <$>(x, y) = 'og(exey ), and we denote

 by Pp,q (x, y) a sum analogous to that in the right-hand side of (98) extended over the

 indices p' +

 log(exey) - Pp,q{x,y), (104)

 o

 and Dynkin aims to prove that Pp,q ( x , y) is a Lie polynomial in x, y . More generally,
 let us consider the algebra of the polynomials in the non-commuting indeterminates

 xo, X' , . . . , xn. If to, . . . , tn e Q, let us set O(to*o, • • • , tnxn) := 'og(ek)X 0 • • • etnXn).

 50 A Banach-Lie algebra is a Banach space (over R or €) endowed with a Lie algebra structure such that
 A x A s (x, y) (-> [jc, >>] e A is continuous. In this case, if || • || is the norm of A, there exists a positive
 constant M such that ''[x, y]'' < M ||jc || • ''y'' for every x, y e A, so that the norm M|| • || is compatible
 with the Lie bracket of A, and Dynkin's arguments (this time also appealing to the completeness of A) can

 be directly generalized.

 By equating the summands with all the f 's of degree 1 from the above far right-hand
 sum and from the right-hand side of (106), Dynkin obtains the equality (see Eq. (6)
 ofDynkin 1949, p. 157):

 Then we have the series expansion

 where Pj(x o, . . . , jcn) is a polynomial of degree io in jto, i' in x' and so on. If jto =

 equals

 All the attention is now shifted to the polynomial P. By the definition of O, one rec-

 ognizes that P can be obtained also as the sum of the coefficients of to, t', . . . , tn of

 degree 1 in the expansion of

 / = (io, . . . , in) of pairwise distinct integers, a couple of consecutive indices iß, iß+ '
 is called regular if iß < iß+' and irregular otherwise. (Now these are also called,
 respectively, the rises and the falls.) He denotes by sj the number of regular couples
 of I and by t' the number of irregular ones. He then shows that the coefficient of

 where the sum runs over the permutations / of {0, 1 , . . . , n}. The main task is thus to

 prove that the right-hand side of (109) is a Lie polynomial. This is accomplished in
 Sect. 2.

 To this end, Dynkin improves his former theorem (99). Indeed, he claims that with
 the same arguments as in Dynkin (1947) the following result holds true: Let Q be a
 polynomial in x o, ... ,xn of the following special form: Q = aj Xi0 • • • xin, the
 sum ranging over the permutations of {0, . . . , n}. Then Q is a Lie polynomial if and

 only if

 Q = X °0J [■■■[[X0,Xh],Xj2]---Xjn],

 J

 where the sum ranges over the permutations J = (j' , . . . , jn) of {I, . . . , n).

 Since P in (109) has the form of the above Q , this suggests to prove that

 where the coefficients b' , boj are as in (109), and where / = O'o, • • • , in) runs over the

 permutations of {0, 1, . . . , n], whereas J = (j' , . . . , in) runs over the permutations
 of {1, . . . , n}. Since the right-hand side of (1 10) is a Lie polynomial, this will prove,
 because of (104) and (107), the theorem of Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff.

 The proof of ( 1 1 0) is technical and quite laborious, and the reader is directly referred

 to Dynkin (1949, pp. 159-161). However, some remarks on this proof are due, since
 it contains the concept of "shuffling." Let us expand the right-hand side of (110) in

 monomials, say X/ ci xb ' ' ' xin • We have to prove that c/ = &/ for all indices I as
 above. Let us split I in two disjoint sequences

 l' = (/j, . . . , i'p), I " - (/", . . . , iq) (p + q = n + 1),

 where the i' and i" are written in the same order as they appear in /. In this case, we

 say that I is a shuffle of /' and I" , and we write (in Dynkin's notation) I e lf U I" .
 The crucial remark, allowing us to transform (110) into a problem of combinatorics,

 is the following: let jco occur in xi0 • • • Xin in the position p + 1, and let us use the
 notation:

 350 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 *i0 * " " %if j - 3Ci' Xo Xjff - . Xj'oj" ?

 where /' = (/o, • • . , /p- i ) and I" = (/^+i , . . . , /n). It is easy to see that, by expanding

 the higher order commutator [• • • [[jto, Xjx ], Xj2' • • • Xjn] in monomials, the summand

 jt/>o/" occurs if and only if / = (j i , . . . , jn ) is a shuffle of /' := (/^-i , . . . , i' , /o)
 (the reversed of /') and of l"' in this case, Jt/'o/" has coefficient 4-1 or -1 according
 to whether p is even or odd.

 This gives the formula

 ci'Qi" = (~')p ^ bo j.

 Jeï'ui "

 The rest of the proof consists of showing that this last identity is satisfied when the c's

 in its left-hand side are replaced by the b's introduced in (109).

 Summing up all his identities, Dynkin is able to provide yet another Lie represen-

 tation of 'og(exey), namely (gathering together (104), (107), (109), and (1 10)):

 log(eV) = ^ - - P I x,...,x' y, . . . , y I , where

 00 i / I ' I

 ' p times q times J

 P(xo, ...,x„)= ^ ^ ^(-l)'07 SOJ ! toj ! [[*0, Xji] ■ ■ -Xjn],

 or, in a more symmetric form,

 P(xo, ...,xn) = (n+l)'(n+1)! [[•*(()' xh] • • •*(„]>

 where J=(j' , . . . , in) runs over the permutations of {1, . . . , n], while /=(*'o , • • • . in)

 runs over the permutations of {0, 1

 Finally, in his paper (1950) Dynkin studies in great detail the applications of his

 representation formula for 'og(exey) to normed Lie algebras and to analytic groups.
 The incipit of the paper clearly states that the "one-to-one correspondence between
 local Lie groups and Lie algebras is the foundation of Lie groups." He then high-
 lights that the algorithms of Campbell and Hausdorff (and also of Baker, we may
 add, though his papers are not mentioned) are not effective for solving the problem
 of convergence, making it necessary "to turn to an indirect proof, using Lie's sys-
 tem of differential equations" and making use of ODEs theory: an application of
 his representation formulas from Dynkin (1947, 1949) "eliminates the need for any
 complementary apparatus ."

 Also the point of view of Dynkin (1950) is new: the starting points are not the
 transformation groups, but the Lie algebras. The main result is thus the construc-

 tion of a local topological group attached to every Banach-Lie algebra by means of
 the explicit series of 'og(exey). The theory of groups and algebras was meanwhile
 advanced sufficiently to allow it possible to use more general notions and provide

 broader generalizations (non- Archimedean fields are considered; normed spaces and
 normed algebras are involved, together with local topological or analytic groups). As
 for the history of the CBHD Theorem, this paper paved the way for the problem of

 improved domains of convergence for the Dynkin series and, by happenstance, for the

 study of other possible representations of 'og(exey).

 To these topics, the modern literature on the CBHD Theorem has devoted a great

 attention. We refer the reader to the references in Bonfiglioli andFulci (2012, Sect. 5.6).

 In particular, for the intertwining of the CBHD Theorem and its "continuous version,"
 the so-called Magnus Expansion, see Blanes et al. (2009) and the comprehensive list
 of references therein.

 10 Hausdorff and Bourbaki's commentaries

 Along with the fact that there is still no conventional agreement on the "fatherhood" of

 the CBHD Theorem (Baker's name is frequently unfairly omitted), the most surprising

 fact concerning the early investigations is that the contributions by Schur, Poincaré,

 and Pascal have presently become almost forgotten.51 In our opinion, there are three

 reasons for this fact. First, they focused on the setting of Lie's theory of groups of trans-

 formations, instead of taking up a purely symbolic approach. Second, the very cold
 judgement of the contributions of Schur, Poincaré, and Pascal (and also of Campbell

 and Baker) given by Hausdorff himself and by Bourbaki has certainly played a major
 rôle. Third, the fact that none of their original papers on the subject was written in
 English has contributed to their becoming obsolete. (Hausdorff's paper did not share

 this lot, though.)

 First, we begin by considering Hausdorff's and Bourbaki's comments on the works

 by Schur, Poincaré, and Pascal; then, we express our opinion on these comments. The
 reader will certainly make his/her own opinion by rediscovering the contributions of
 these three mathematicians contained in Sects. 3, 5, and 6.

 In Hausdorff (1906, p. 20), we find the following comments:

 - Poincaré, in handling "Campbell's problem," has not proved the Exponential The-

 orem in its general and symbolic form, but instead in the form of the group theory.
 Hausdorff underlines that Poincaré has insisted from the beginning on the struc-

 ture equations among his symbols and their commutators.52 He then remarks that

 his own symbolic proof yields the theorem in the group setting too, but not vice
 versa - as he stresses again. Nonetheless (in the note at p. 20), Poincaré's 1901
 paper is cited as a "beautiful" (literally "schöne") source having some weak rela-
 tionship with Hausdorff's; later (in the note at p. 40), Poincaré's residue-calculus

 51 It is very hard to find quotations of the papers by Schur, Poincaré, and Pascal (concerning with the
 product of exponentials) in modern books on Lie groups. To the best of our knowledge, exceptions are:
 Czyz (1994) (quoting Pascal 1902c and Poincaré 1900) and Duistermaat and Kolk 2000 (quoting Poincaré
 1899 and Schur 1891, 1893).

 52 Namely, on identities of the type [X/, X j] = X k cijk xk- In practice, Poincaré is dealing with an
 actual finite dimensional Lie algebra instead of a set of abstract non-commuting indeterminates, in which
 Hausdorff was interested.

 technique is recalled, and a couple of formulas from Poincaré (1900) is compared
 with Hausdorff's.

 352 R. Achilles, A. Bonfiglioli

 - Hausdorff thinks that Pascal's works on the product of two exponentials have not
 overcome the inconvenience of an abundance of computations. According to him,

 these massive computations make it hard and difficult to check the validity of Pas-
 cal's proof and the applicability to the group theory. He then faults Pascal for
 omitting - in his last paper - the convergence question.

 - A comment on Schur's contribution is missing in Hausdorff's foreword. Schur is

 acknowledged only at p. 34, for having proved for the first time a certain series
 expansion involving Bernoulli numbers.

 In Bourbaki's book (1972, Chapter III, Historical Note), we find the following com-
 ments:

 - Poincaré studied the identity euev = ew as a possibly multiple valued function
 for W. Besides briefly describing his general residue-calculus approach, the actual

 results obtained by Poincaré are not mentioned, whereas he is faulted (together with

 Campbell and Baker) for a lack of clarity about the question whether the commu-

 tators are symbolic expressions or elements of some fixed Lie algebra.

 - Pascal's name is listed -en passant- as some of those who returned to the question
 of^ = ew , but nothing is said about his results, and his papers are not even
 mentioned in the list of references. Hausdorff instead is acknowledged as the only
 "perfectly precise" reliable source.

 - Schur's results on the product of exponentials are not mentioned: he is recalled only

 for his proof of the fact that C2 assumptions on transformation groups are (up to

 isomorphism) sufficient to get analytic regularity.

 We would like to express some opinions on the above comments by Hausdorff and

 Bourbaki.

 (i) Curiously, Hausdorff insists on reasserting over again that his own theorem
 implies Poincaré's and not vice versa, but eventually his words become more

 prudent53: this legitimately leads us to suppose that Hausdorff had foreseen that
 Poincaré proved more than it seems. Indeed, in Poincaré (1900), he introduced

 for the very first time the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie group, but the
 relevance of this invention was not caught for several decades (see Ton-That and
 Tran 1999 for related topics), and probably it passed unnoticed also to Haus-
 dorff. Likely, Hausdorff did not consider the possibility that Poincaré's formula
 euev = ew was more than a result in Lie groups of transformations. Indeed,

 53 Indeed Hausdorff (1906, p. 20) says that, even disregarding the fact that his theorem implies Poincaré's
 and not vice versa, he believes that his own contribution offers such a novelty and simplification that it
 cannot be considered a superfluous supplement with respect to Poincaré's paper. Then he feels the need to
 return once more on this subject, and he stresses again (p. 40) that Poincaré proved only a group-theoretic

 theorem which is not a full substitute for his own, as it seems to follow from a further argument (the words
 are now more cautious). He further adds a quite long remark as a confirmation of his thesis. Moreover, he

 says (p. 41) that he does not want to discuss the possibility that, from the validity of Poincaré's theorem on
 an r -dimensional group for every arbitrary r, one could eventually get the symbolic theorem. Indeed, he

 points out that for his scopes it was important only to observe that at least not immediately (another prudent
 expression) Poincaré's theorem does not comprehend his general result.

 The early proofs of the theorem of Campbell, Baker, Hausdorff, and Dynkin 353

 this formula is a formal identity in the universal enveloping algebra % (g) of any
 finite dimensional Lie algebra g, which determines W as a Lie series in U, V,
 and (when specialized to g) the formal series W converges near 0 e g. Further,
 as Schmid (1982, p. 184) neatly pointed out, Poincaré's theorem makes no ref-
 erence at all to g being the Lie algebra of the infinitesimal transformations of

 a group.54 It then seems that Bourbaki's and Hausdorff's criticisms concerning
 this fact should be mitigated.

 (ii) Hausdorff complains about the abundance of computations in Pascal's papers
 and he says (see Hausdorff 1906, p. 20, lines 21-22) that these massive calcu-
 lations make it very difficult to check the correctness of Pascal's proof. In our

 opinion, the presence of abundant computations should not be enough to despise

 a proof. In this case, the main criticism may concern the fact that Pascal focused

 on groups of transformations; however, we believe that the greatest part of Pas-
 cal's arguments in his series of papers (Pascal 1901a, b, 1902a, b,c) are, though
 long and laborious, more transparent than some of the proofs only sketched by
 Campbell or Baker.

 (iii) Even though Bourbaki's historical notes do not pay attention to their contribu-
 tions, Pascal and Schur should be regarded as noteworthy precursors of what was

 lately to be known only as the Campbell-(Baker-)Hausdorff Formula. Following
 Schmid (1982, p. 177), this formula is already contained "in disguise" in Schur's

 papers. Pascal contributed in disclosing this fact (see §2 in Pascal 1902c, p. 565)

 by proving that the same formulas found by Schur may be obtained starting from
 his own version of the Exponential Theorem, a completely undisguised result.

 Acknowledgments The authors thank Professors Umberto Bottazzini and Jeremy Gray for their careful

 reading of a previous version of the manuscript, and are especially grateful to the latter for having brought
 to their attention Scharlau's commentary in Hausdorff (2001), from which they greatly benefited.

 54 Obviously, it is not possible not to recognize Hausdorff's merits in shifting all the attention to purely
 symbolic arguments. Nonetheless, our opinion is that Poincaré's ingenious approach (take a finite dimen-
 sional Lie algebra g, obtain the Exponential Theorem on W (g), go back to g and prove the convergence
 with the residue calculus) is definitely more modern than a 1900 publication. Furthermore, we think that

 the only obstacle in obtaining from Poincaré's results the general version of Hausdorff's theorem is the
 finite-dimensionality of the algebra g (as Hausdorff had foreseen!). Indeed, nowadays, we know that, if 0 is
 the free Lie algebra of a vector space V (note that g is infinite-dimensional whenever V ^ {0}), then % (g)
 is isomorphic to the tensor algebra & ( V ): hence, a suitable Exponential Theorem on ûl/ (g) = & ( V ) may
 provide the general statement of the CBHD Theorem, which is indeed an identity between formal power
 series related to V).
