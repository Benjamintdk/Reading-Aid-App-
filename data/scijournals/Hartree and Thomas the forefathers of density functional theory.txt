 Abstract Douglas Hartree and Hilleth Thomas were graduate students together at
 Cambridge University in the mid-1920s. Each developed an important approximation

 method to calculate the electronic structure of atoms. Each went on to make significant

 contributions to numerical analysis and to the development of scientific computing.

 Their early efforts were fused in the mid-1960s with the development of an approach to

 the many-particle problem in quantum mechanics called density functional theory. This

 paper discusses the experiences which led Hartree and Thomas to their approximations,
 outlines the similarities in their subsequent careers, and highlights the essential role

 their work played in the foundational papers of modern density functional theory.

 1 Introduction

 The year 1924 was quite hectic for Ralph Fowler's research group at Cambridge
 University.1 His most senior Ph.D. student, Douglas Hartree, published three papers in

 a continuing series that reported the results of Bohr-Sommerfeld calculations designed
 to reveal the electron orbits responsible for the observed spectra of one-electron
 like atoms. Another Ph.D. student, Paul Dirac, submitted five papers for publication,

 beginning with a study of molecular dissociation in a temperature gradient and ending
 with an analysis of the adiabatic invariance of action integrals. Fowler's most junior

 Ph.D. student, Hilleth Thomas, wrote a paper that discussed adiabatic invariants from

 1 For students interested to do a theoretical PhD, Fowler was the only potential supervisor at Cambridge

 with an interest in quantum theory (Mehra and Rechenberg 1982, Volume 4).

 a statistical point of view and began classical calculations relevant to the passage of
 charged particles through matter.

 It is not surprising that old quantum theory topics figured prominently in the

 activities of these students. By 1924, the spectacular successes of the Bohr
 Sommerfeld theory for hydrogen and hydrogen-like atoms could be studied from

 the latest (fourth) edition of Arnold Sommerfeld's Atombau und Spektrallinien. Max

 Born's book devoted to the same subject, Vorlesungen iiber Atommechanik, was pub
 lished early in 1925. On the other hand, calculations performed by rising stars like
 James Franck, Hendrik Kramers, Werner Heisenberg, and John Van Vleck were unable

 to reproduce those successes for helium and other non-hydrogen-like multi-electron

 atoms (Mehra and Rechenberg 1982, Volume 4; Darrigol 1992). For that reason (Kragh
 2012),

 Among many physicists in the period 1923-1925 there was a mounting feel
 ing that the existing quantum theory of the atom had come to a dead end and

 that further search for substantial progress within the framework of the Bohr

 Sommerfeld theory was futile. The old framework had to be replaced by a new
 one.

 The new framework was supplied by Heisenberg, who sent a proof copy of his
 paper "Quantum-theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations"

 to Fowler in August of 1925. Fowler passed the paper on to Dirac and the story of how
 Dirac quickly grasped the essentials and went on to create his unique and profound
 approach to quantum mechanics (beginning with a paper submitted only two months
 later) has been told many times (Jammer 1966, Chapter 5; Mehra and Rechenberg
 1982, Volume 4).

 In this paper, I examine the activities of Dirac's classmates, Hartree and Thomas,

 during this period of rapid transition from the old quantum theory of Bohr and Som

 merfeld to the new quantum theory of Heisenberg, Dirac, and Schrodinger. Sections
 2 and 3 review the experiences that led each to develop an approximation method to
 compute the properties of many-electron atoms and the subsequent contributions each
 made to numerical analysis and scientific computing. The approximation schemes
 invented by Thomas and Hartree have historical importance because their general
 izations and application to other many-electron systems have enjoyed many years of
 quantitative success. Equally important, each stands out as an essential intellectual

 precursor to a very successful approach to many-particle quantum mechanics devel
 oped in the 1960s called density functional theory (Parr and Yang 1989). Section 4

 outlines the foundations of modern density functional theory and highlights the debt
 this theory owes to the Hartree and Thomas methodologies.

 2 Douglas Hartree and the self-consistent atom

 The life of Douglas Rayner Hartree is recounted admirably in a biography writ
 ten by his final Ph.D. student, Charlotte Froese Fischer (2003). Her book rightly
 draws attention to Hartree's career-long interest and ability to find numerical solu
 tions to scientific problems. This talent appeared early when he was recruited from
 his first year of graduate studies at Cambridge to join a group of more senior

 Cambridge-trained men (including his future Ph.D. advisor Ralph Fowler) studying

 anti-aircraft gunnery in support of the British Ministry of Munitions during World
 War I (van der Kloot 2011). The differential equations that determine the trajectory
 of artillery shells are not solvable analytically when frictional drag and wind effects

 are treated realistically. The 20-year-old Hartree introduced several innovations which

 made the numerical integration of these equations fast and efficient (Darwin 1958).

 After his return to graduate school, Hartree discovered that he had no aptitude for
 experimental work and initially contented himself to assist a fellow graduate student

 from Ernest Rutherford's laboratory who recruited him to analyze the trajectories of
 electrons in an inhomogeneous magnetic field (Hartree 1923a). Hartree's true research
 career was launched by a set of lectures on quantum theory given at Cambridge
 by Niels Bohr in 1922. Bohr's articles and lectures were famously qualitative and
 Hartree was interested to obtain quantitative results from Bohr's theory of the spectra
 of atoms. Fowler was well aware that this choice leveraged Hartree's unusual back

 ground because "such an application must involve much numerical computation" and
 "he is to be judged as a computing and classifying physicist".2 This opinion must

 not have been limited to Fowler because, 50 years later, the American physicist John
 Slater took umbrage with any characterization of Hartree as a "mere computer" and
 preferred to describe him as a "matter-of-fact sort who indicates the argument behind

 what he does and tries to write or speak in the most comprehensible manner possible"
 (Slater 1975, Section 7).

 Hartree's first Bohr-inspired paper on atomic spectra adopted the prevailing view

 that the electrons in an atom move in planar elliptical orbits in a force field produced by
 the nucleus and the electrons themselves (Hartree 1923b). For simplicity, he assumed
 a central field of force so the associated potential function, v(p), depended only on the

 variable ρ = r/αβ, the electron-nucleus distance scaled by the Bohr radius. He also

 In this expression, the integer η is the principal quantum number, the azimuthal quan

 tum number k quantizes the total angular momentum, and e is the orbit energy.3 The
 largest and smallest values of the scaled orbit radii, p\ and po> are the roots of the
 quantity in the square brackets in Eq. (1). Hartree introduced an "effective nuclear
 charge" Z(p), using the electrostatic formula,

 and set his task as

 the determination of Z(p) such that for given η and k the values of e calculated

 from Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) become as nearly as possible those of the terms of the
 [measured] optical and X-ray spectra... The assignment of quantum numbers
 to the different terms is taken from Bohr's theory.

 In other words, his goal was to work backwards from each atom's observed ionization

 energies and the quantum numbers assigned to that energy level to find an empirical
 potential function v(p) characteristic of that atom.

 In a section of his paper labeled "Sketch of Practical Work", Hartree explained that
 it was desirable to replace v(p) by Z(p) for numerical work [despite the extra numer
 ical integration implied by Eq. (2)] because the latter was a slower varying function
 with a smaller total range of variation. As a result, it was possible to "arrange the
 computational part of the work in such a way that no apparatus is required beyond
 a 10-inch slide rule and a table of squares". Hartree made a point to contrast his
 explicitly numerical calculations with similar work published earlier by Erwin Fues
 (a former student of Sommerfeld) who had used a piece-wise analytic approximation
 for v(p) to avoid numerical integrations (Fues 1922a,b, 1923). This procedure intro
 duced features into the results which Hartree believed made them "appear doubtful".

 Hartree achieved some measure of success with this paper and with several related
 papers published soon thereafter. He received his Ph.D. in 1926. Dirac also earned his

 Ph.D. in 1926 and Hartree's biographer informs us that Hartree was "a great admirer of

 Dirac" (Fischer 2003). That being said, there is no evidence that the quantum mechan

 ical work of his classmate had a direct effect on him. By contrast, the publication of
 Schrôdinger's four papers on the foundations of wave mechanics in the first half of
 1926 had a profound effect (Schrôdinger 1926a,b,c,d). This becomes clear from the

 first two parts of the seminal paper which Hartree read to the Cambridge Philosophical
 Society on November 21, 1927 (Hartree 1923a,b).

 Hartree and Thomas: the forefathers of density 335

 In Part I of this paper, Hartree wrote out the Schrodinger equation for a typical
 electron in a multi-electron atom and outlined the practical steps needed to solve it.
 He adopted the Schrodinger perspective that \ψ|2 gives the volume density of charge

 for an electron in a quantum state described by the wave function ψ. Moreover, he knew

 from a theorem proved by Sommerfeld student Albrecht Unsold that a closed shell of

 electrons produces a spherically symmetric distribution of charge (Unsold 1927). This

 suggested to him that a wave mechanical calculation with "the assumption of a central

 field may give results more satisfactory in detail than could be expected [from] the

 older form of quantum theory." Accordingly, he used the known spherical harmonic
 of order I, Si (θ, φ), to make the wave function ansatz,

 ψ(ρ,θ,φ) = -^5ι(θ,φ).

 Ρ (ρ)

 Ρ

 This form separates the one-particle Schrôdinger partial differential equation into an

 ordinary differential equation for P(p) and a partial differential equation for which
 Si(0, φ) is a solution. If v(p) and e have the same meanings as in Eq. (1), he concluded
 that the radial function must be a solution of

 Comparing Eq. (4) with Eq. (1) shows that k = -JI (/ +1 ) is the dimensionless angular
 momentum of an electron described by the wave function in Eq. (3).

 Characteristically, Hartree first pointed out the conceptual advantages of using the

 function P(p) and then described in detail the method he had devised to solve Eq. (4).

 He applied the method of "central differences" described in Whittaker and Robinson's
 textbook The Calculus of Observations4 and proposed to

 integrate the equation outward from Ρ = 0 at ρ — 0, and inward from Ρ — 0
 at ρ = σο, and by trial find a value of e for which these solutions meet at some
 convenient intermediate radius ρ...

 All the work was done by hand, but he reported that

 only one calculation in each interval requires a slide rule (or logs), namely, that

 of P" from the differential equation; the rest involves only additions and subtrac

 tions, largely of numbers with one or two significant figures, and multiplications
 by 2, 3, j2, which can be done mentally.

 Part II of Hartree's 1928 paper applied the methods of Part I to calculate the effec
 tive nuclear charge Z(p) = P2(p)/p2 and spectral term energy e associated with
 each electron for a variety of atoms. Hartree's key innovation was to use solutions
 of the one-particle Schrôdinger equation (4) to approximate the charge density and
 potential for a system properly described using a many-particle Schrodinger equation.

 Proceeding entirely intuitively to define the potential v(p) in Eq. (4), he decided that

 4 Whittaker and Robinson (1924) was probably the first textbook devoted entirely to numerical analysis.
 The authors intended it to be used by "astronomers, meteorologists, physicists, engineers, naval architects,
 actuaries, biometricians, and statisticians."

 each of the Ν electrons of an atom should experience the spherical average of the elec

 trostatic potential in Eq. (2) produced by the nucleus and the Ν — 1 other electrons. A

 crucial feature is that each electron wave function is determined from a potential field

 which depends, in part, on the wave functions of all the other electrons. To deal with

 this, Hartree began with a guess for the central potential to be used in the Schrodinger

 equation for each electron. From the calculated wave functions, he found the charge
 density associated with each electron and the electrostatic potential produced by all
 the other electrons. The spherical average of the latter generally did not agree with
 the initial guess potential. On the other hand, he could use this output potential in
 place of the initial potential for a repetition of the entire process. After three repe

 titions or so, Hartree found that his results were self-consistent in the sense that the

 output potential equaled the input potential to within his desired numerical accuracy.5
 Specifically,

 In the numerical work, two places of decimals have usually been kept in Z(p) in
 the initial and final fields, and the successive approximations towards a self
 consistent field have been continued until the maximum difference in Zip)
 between the initial and final fields became less than 0.1.

 Hartree presented quantitative results for four atomic systems: He, Rb, Na , and
 CI-. In each case, the initial guess potential was taken from a statistical treatment
 of atoms published one year earlier by his classmate Hilleth Thomas (see the next
 section). For helium, Hartree's calculated energy of 24.85 eV to remove the least
 well-bound electron from the atom agreed very well with the observed value of 24.6

 eV. For rubidium, he judged "the general agreement of X-ray and optical term values

 calculated by the methods here given with those observed very satisfactory." Moreover,

 a detailed study of the effective potential felt by the various electrons in the Rb atom

 allowed him to make contact with Bohr's idea of penetrating versus non-penetrating
 orbits (Kragh 2012). Finally, he used his calculated charge distributions for Na+ and
 CI- to evaluate Bragg's formula for the scattering power of x-rays from rocksalt and
 announced that the comparison with experiment was "very satisfactory indeed".6

 Very soon, papers by John Slater and Vladimir Fock provided firm mathematical

 support for Hartree's intuition (Slater 1930; Fock 1930). An orbital variational cal

 culation based on the simplest guess for a many-electron wave function as a product

 of one-electron orbitals reproduced Hartree's equations (except for his extra approx
 imation to spherically average the potential). A similar variational calculation based
 on the simplest guess for a many-electron wave function which builds in the Pauli
 exclusion principle generates what are called the Hartree-Fock equations. The latter

 are generally acknowledged as foundational to many parts of atomic physics and much
 of quantum chemistry (Cowan 1981; Pople 1999; Park 1999).

 ' Hartree cited self-consistent Bohr-Sommerfeld calculations using Eq. (1) by the American physicist
 Robert Bruce Lindsay as precedent for the view that one should "find a field of force such that the distribution

 of charge given by the wave functions for the core electrons shall reproduce the field." See pp. 29-31 and
 p. 45 of Froese (2003) for more on Lindsay.

 6 The complete comparison was published later by James, Waller and Hartree (1928).

 337

 As a professor at the University of Manchester, and later back at Cambridge Uni

 versity, Hartree continued to perform various kinds of self-consistent atomic structure
 calculations for many years. His 1957 monograph, The Calculation of Atomic Struc
 tures, summarized 30 years of work by himself, his students, and his collaborators. The

 titles of two earlier books, Calculating Instruments and Machines (1949) and Numeri

 cal Analysis (1952), reveal two other passions of his mature scientific life. Particularly
 notable are the many contributions he made to the design, construction, and application

 of an analog device designed to integrate differential equations mechanically called
 a differential analyzer. He was also one of the first (scientific) users of the ENIAC
 (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), the first electronic, general-purpose

 programmable digital computer. The last decade of his life was spent promoting and
 popularizing the use of computers in all areas of science and engineering.

 3 Hilleth Thomas and the statistical atom

 London native Llewellyn Hilleth Thomas was told that as a small child he "could say

 at once what day of the week it would be on any date in the next few years" (Thomas
 1975). He recalled reading a popular account of the Bohr atom around the age of
 10 years and went up to Trinity College, Cambridge at age 18. As an undergraduate,
 Thomas attended lectures given by a galaxy of scientific stars including Charles
 G. Darwin, Thomas J. Bromwich, John E. Littlewood, Geoffrey I. Taylor, Arthur
 S. Eddington, E. Arthur Milne, and Joseph Larmor (Jackson 2009). In his final term

 (Easter 1924), he followed his usual practice and took careful notes of Ralph Fowler's
 lectures on "The Quantum Theory of Spectra".7

 In the fall of 1924, Thomas began graduate studies with Fowler just as the latter

 left to begin an academic year-long visit to Bohr's institute in Copenhagen. The main

 thrust of Thomas' thesis work was to be classical calculations relevant to the passage
 of charged particles through matter.8 However, in Fowler's absence, Thomas worked

 on an old quantum theory problem which became the subject of his first published

 paper, "An extended form of Kronecker's theorem with an application which shows that

 Burgers' theorem on adiabatic invariants is statistically true for an assembly" (Thomas

 1925). We discuss this little-known and awkwardly-titled paper—which won him the
 coveted Smith Prize for 1925—because its content bears directly on Thomas' later
 invention of the statistical atom.

 As early as 1918, Bohr used ideas developed by his Leiden colleague Paul Ehrenfest

 to justify the quantization rules which elevated certain classical electron orbits to the
 status of "stationary states" (Darrigol 1992; Kragh 2012). These stationary orbits

 needed to maintain their integrity in the presence of modest perturbations like the

 application of external electric and magnetic fields. This implied that the phase integral

 in Eq. (1) had to remain the same ("invariant") when very slow ("adiabatic") changes
 were made to the Hamiltonian that defined the orbits. For his Ph.D. work, Ehrenfest's

 student Johannes Martinus Burgers proved that this was true for multiply periodic
 systems (like many-electron atoms) as long as the various frequencies present in the
 Fourier decomposition of the orbital motions were not related to one another in a
 simple way (Burgers 1917). Unfortunately, there was good reason to believe that

 the unwanted relations between frequencies could not be avoided in practice. Early in
 1925, this motivated Dirac and Max von Laue to independently publish generalizations
 of Burgers' theorem that removed this assumption (Dirac 1925; von Laue 1925).
 Thomas was aware of the work of Dirac and von Laue and took a rather different

 approach to the problem.9 His paper asserts that

 The quantum conditions must be such that they are, statistically, adiabatic invari
 ants, but need not necessarily be so for single systems. ...it is clear that the
 average changes in [the invariant] can be made as small as we like in an assem

 bly of similar systems sufficient in number for the state of the assembly to be
 represented sufficiently by a continuous density in its phase space.

 The remark about "a continuous density in its phase space" speaks to Thomas' aim
 to prove Burgers' theorem as a statistical result using his own generalization of a
 theorem proved by the mathematician Leopold Kronecker (Kronecker 1884). One
 starts with the points {nx\,nx2,, nx^) in a -dimensional space where η — 1,2,...

 and the Xk are independent irrational numbers. If one retains only the decimal part
 of each nxm, Kronecker's theorem states that the points are densely distributed in

 a ^-dimensional unit cube. The connection between this result and the dense filling
 of phase space needed to compute statistical averages was by then well established

 by scientists working to apply the methods of probability theory to physics problems

 8 This was a favorite subject of Fowler at the time. See Sect. 4 of the Bibliography of Milne (1945).

 9 Dirac (1925) thanks Fowler "for suggesting this investigation and for his help during its progress. Thomas
 (1925) thanks "J.E. Littlewood for his criticism and encouragement" and Fowler "for his help". It is not
 clear if Fowler actually suggested this topic to Thomas.

 (von Plato 1994). A statistical proof of the Burgers' theorem followed by applying
 this idea to the orbits used to compute the Bohr-Sommerfeld phase integrals.

 Fowler arranged for Thomas to spend his second academic year in graduate school
 (1925-1926) at Bohr's institute in Copenhagen. This turned out to be his annus
 mirabilis. Most famously, he exploited his knowledge of relativity learned at Cam
 bridge from Arthur Eddington and applied Willem De Sittter's relativistic corrections

 to the moon's motion to the motion of an electron with spin angular momentum
 (Thomas 1975). This work, done "over a weekend at Christmas time" produced the
 "Thomas precession factor of 1/2" that reconciled the magnitude of the atomic fine

 structure in hydrogen with the anomalous Zeeman effect (Thomas 1926a). Apart from

 this, and despite meeting Kramers, Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, the remainder of

 Thomas' activity in Copenhagen had nothing to do with the exciting work being done
 by these physicists (or his classmate Dirac) to invent the new quantum mechanics. As

 he later put it, "I was always slow in accepting new ideas and understood nothing of
 this for four or five years" (Jackson 2009).

 Our interest here is the work Thomas did at Bohr's institute motivated by his

 familiarity with his classmate Hartree's Bohr-Sommerfeld calculations. Specifically
 (Thomas. 1962),

 it was a great deal of work to carry this through for any one atom, and the
 question was whether one couldn't get by [with] a simple averaging assumption,

 something which would be an approximation which would apply to all atoms.

 The paper Thomas published on this subject, "The calculation of atomic fields", is very
 terse (Thomas 1926b). A three-sentence introduction gives way quickly to "Assump
 tions and the deduction from them of an equation". The explicitly stated assumptions

 are (i) neglect relativity; (ii) the electrons possess an effective radial potential energy
 V (r) which approaches zero as r -*■ oo and — Ze2/r as r 0 for an atom with
 nuclear charge Z; (iii) the electrons are distributed uniformly in the phase space at
 a rate of two for each phase space volume Λ3; and (iv) V(r) is determined by the
 nuclear charge and the distribution of electrons as specified in (iii). The first two
 assumptions were made by Hartree (1923b). The other two assumptions are more
 interesting.

 Thomas later recalled that the crucial assumption (iii) followed from his "old busi

 ness of Kronecker's theorem and Burgers' theorem" which told him that "the Bohr
 orbits filled up phase space uniformly. It was only a short step to saying that if you

 have two electrons per orbit you just distribute them in the phase space and you have

 naturally defined them up to a definite energy" (Thomas 1962). In other words, since

 each differential element of phase space has volume d^pd^r, a spherical approxima

 tion to the total volume of phase space occupied by all the electrons in a unit volume of

 coordinate space at a radial distance r from the nucleus is (4π/3)p^ (r ), where po (r ) is
 the momentum of the most energetic electron. Now, the statistical physics of the time
 had established that each particle of even a classical system occupies a phase space
 volume of Λ3 (Desalvo 1992). Therefore, using the recently deduced fact that each
 Bohr orbit could accommodate two electrons (spin degeneracy), Thomas concluded

 that the number density of electrons at each point in his statistical atom was

 2 4 ,

 n(r) = -^-np0(r). (5)

 This formula is true only for a system with uniform density; Thomas assumed it could

 be used locally for an atom with a spatially varying number density. Therefore, if Ε ο is

 the total energy of the most energetic electron so Eo = pl(r)/2m + V(r), the effective
 potential determines the electron density from

 n(r) = {2m[£-V(r)]}3/2.

 (6)

 Thomas' assumption (iv) makes the approximation that the electron density deter
 mines the effective potential energy entirely through the Poisson equation of classical
 electrostatics,

 V2V(r) = -Ane2n(r).

 Substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (7) amounts to a requirement of self-consistency entirely

 analogous to (albeit much simpler than) the later use of this concept by Hartree. Thomas
 used a dimensionless radial distance ρ = r/a# and a dimensionless effective potential

 φ(ρ) to write the one-dimensional, non-linear differential equation that results from
 this substitution as

 (7)

 (8)

 Today, Eq. (8) is called the Thomas-Fermi equation because Enrico Fermi indepen
 dently derived Eqs. (5)-(8) about a year after Thomas' paper (Fermi 1927). For Fermi,

 this was a natural application of the new statistics he had derived for particles that obey
 the Pauli exclusion principle.10 We have seen that Thomas' line of reasoning was quite
 different. Indeed, Thomas' derivation of Eq. (8) in Copenhagen preceded the publi
 cation of the 1926 papers by both Fermi and Dirac where they announced what we
 today call "Fermi-Dirac" statistics.11

 The majority of Thomas' paper concerns the integration of Eq. (8). He only needed
 to do this once because, with φ(ρ) in hand, a simple return to the original variables

 (including the atomic number) made the results applicable to any atom. Thomas later
 reported that the solution "took considerable time to do since it involved numerical
 integration. I didn't know how to do numerical integration. I had to learn" (Thomas

 1962). Using logarithmic tables and the textbook by Whittaker and Robinson (1924),

 he computed the effective nuclear charge from Eq. (2) and compared his results with
 unpublished Bohr-Sommerfeld results for this quantity for cesium he had obtained
 from Hartree. The agreement was quite satisfactory. Indeed, Hartree's first paper on

 " It is very unlikely Thomas would have seen the February 1926 Italian version of Fermi's paper on
 quantum statistics. The easily accessible German version did not appear until April, one month after Thomas
 completed his numerical integration of Eq. (8). Dirac's paper appeared in August.

 his self-consistent method (discussed in Sect. 2) remarks that "the [charge] distribution
 given by Thomas' method is a good smoothed-out approximation to the distribution
 giving the self-consistent field" (Hartree 1928a).

 Dirac (1930) soon generalized the Thomas-Fermi atom to include quantum
 mechanical exchange and Wilhelm Lenz (1932) showed that the Thomas-Fermi
 equation follows naturally from a variational principle if the energy is chosen as a
 specific functional of the density alone. An important advance was made when Carl
 Friedrich von Weizsâcker (1935) introduced a density gradient Vp(r) into the Lenz
 energy functional to provide a better description of density inhomogeneities. The
 theory has been used extensively over the years in atomic physics, plasma physics,

 astrophysics, nuclear physics, and condensed matter physics whenever the need to dis

 cover broad trends was greater than the need for great accuracy. Indeed, a commentator
 mused in 1991 that (Spruch 1991)

 it would be interesting to contemplate how profitable it might have been for
 Thomas and Fermi.. .to have formed a Thomas-Fermi Model Company. It would

 certainly have been a growth industry, for there have been literally thousands of
 published articles based on the model.

 By the time he returned to Cambridge in the fall of 1926, Thomas had completed
 (or nearly completed) the work for seven research papers.12 He received his Ph.D. in

 1927 and took an assistant professor position at Ohio State University in 1929. During

 17 years at Ohio State, Thomas published papers on diverse topics ranging from the
 quantum theory of optical reflection from metallic surfaces to non-linearities in the

 ro-vibrational spectrum of polyatomic molecules to the introduction of the "sector

 focusing" method for charged particles in cyclotrons. He spent 3 years during World

 War II at the Aberdeen Proving Ground where, like Hartree during World War I, he
 was attached to a Ballistics Research Laboratory (Price 1994). A1946 move to the new
 IBM Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University began a new
 phase of his research career. Again like Hartree, Thomas contributed significantly to
 both the design of computer hardware and to the development of numerical methods
 designed to exploit the newly available computing power. Historians of computing
 credit Thomas with the first variable-step-size algorithm for the efficient numerical
 integration of differential equations (Gear and Skeel 1990).

 At the Watson Lab (Brennan 1971),

 Thomas pioneered in the development of an iterative computer method of approx

 imating wave functions for three-particle problems and in adapting for computer

 solution problems in hydrodynamics, elasticity theory and electron distributions

 in atoms... As far back as 1946, he had considered the possibility of using tiny

 pieces of various kinds of steels to store information magnetically and perform
 logic—work which anticipated the subsequent development of magnetic core

 memory.

 12 One of these (Thomas 1927), reports a tour-de-force classical calculation of electron capture by double

 scattering which has withstood the test of time and subsequent quantum mechanical calculations (Shakeshaft
 and Spruch 1979).

 An article entitled "The use of large scale computing in physics" was intended to
 alert physicists to both the hardware and numerical methods then available to solve a

 variety of problems they might encounter in their work (Sheldon and Thomas 1953).
 Thomas moved to North Carolina State University in 1968 where he "continued his

 role as encyclopedic scholar" until his retirement in 1976 (Jackson 2009).

 4 Density functional theory

 342 A. Zangwill

 Essential features of Thomas' statistical atom and Hartree's self-consistent atom were

 combined and generalized in the mid-1960s by an approach to the electronic structure

 of many-electron systems called density functional theory (DFT). In its many vari
 ations, DFT is arguably the most popular method used by contemporary physicists,

 chemists, and material scientists who are interested to calculate (albeit approximately)
 the electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties of atoms, molecules, and condensed

 phases (Koch and Holthausen 2000; Louie and Cohen 2006). Several of the most highly
 cited papers in the entire physics literature pertain to DFT (Redner 2005) and one-half

 of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded for the development of the theory.

 Density functional theory was born in 1964 when physics professor Walter Kohn
 (then at the University of California at San Diego) and post-doctoral fellow Pierre
 Hohenberg published a paper with the innocuous title "Inhomogeneous electron gas"
 (Hohenberg and Kohn 1964). The paper's abstract establishes the authors' interest in

 "the ground state of an interacting electron gas in an external potential t>(r)." A typical
 example of the latter is the Coulomb potential produced by one or more positively
 charged atomic nuclei fixed in space. In their introduction, Hohenberg and Kohn (HK)
 single out the usefulness of the Thomas-Fermi method for its "simple though crude
 descriptions of inhomogeneous systems like atoms and impurities in metals".13 They

 alert the reader that the Thomas-Fermi method had seen "some important advances...
 in the last decade" and announce that "the present paper represents a contribution in

 the same area." In this way, they prepare the reader to engage with a work where "the
 electronic density n{r) plays a central role."

 The first result HK report is a four-line reductio ad absurdum proof that the exact

 ground state energy of a many-electron system is a functional of the ground-state
 electron density, i.e., Ε — £'[n(r)]. This was quite unexpected because, up to that

 point, it was widely believed that any calculation of the ground state energy required

 knowledge of either the many-particle wave function or the two-particle density matrix

 (Lôwdin 1960; Pople 1999). HK then cite the long range of the Coulomb interaction as

 motivation to "separate out the classical Coulomb energy" and write the total energy
 functional in the form,

 E[n\ = J d3r v(r)n(r) + ~ J d3r J + G[n]. (9)

 HK do not refer to the original papers of either Thomas or Fermi. Instead, they direct the reader to a

 review paper (March 1957).

 Hartree and Thomas: the forefathers of density 343

 The first term on the right side of Eq. (9) is the interaction energy of the electrons

 with the external potential u(r). The second term is the classical Coulomb self-energy
 of the electrons. The functional G[«] in Eq. (9) includes the exact kinetic energy of the
 electron system, as well as all the energy associated with electron-electron Coulomb

 repulsions not already counted by the classical electrostatic energy. Specifically, the
 classical term does not account for quantum mechanical exchange effects which tend

 to keep electrons with the same spin apart and short-range correlation effects which
 tend to keep electrons with opposite spin apart.

 A major interest of HK was to study approximations to G[n] for electron systems

 with nearly constant density or with a slowly varying density. In both cases, they used
 information that was known at the time about the homogeneous electron gas. This is

 a model system of quantum mechanical electrons with uniform density η and infinite

 volume. For example, if the sum of the kinetic, exchange, and correlation energy per
 particle for this gas is

 £θ(Ό — foOO + ^exchange "1" ^correlation("),

 (10)

 one simple approximation to G[«] for an inhomogeneous gas is to evaluate Eq. (10)

 using the local electron density at every point in the system, weight this energy/particle

 by the local density itself, and integrate over all of space to get14

 In a section designed to make contact with Thomas-Fermi theory, HK make a
 drastic approximation to Eq. (10). They neglect the exchange and correlation energies

 altogether and approximate the exact kinetic energy per particle to(n) by the kinetic

 energy per particle of a non-interacting electron gas with uniform density n. The latter

 is the kinetic energy per particle the electrons would have if they had no electric charge.
 Using this approximation for go(n) to evaluate Eq. (11) gives

 Substituting Eq. (12) and the potential energy u(r) = —Ze2/r into Eq. (9) produces
 exactly the energy functional used by Lenz (1932) to derive the Thomas-Fermi equa

 tion (8) by varying the density function. HK thereby demonstrated that the Thomas

 Fermi method is the simplest possible version—and therefore the natural intellectual

 precursor—of their more general density functional theory. Most of the remainder of

 the HK paper examines systematic improvements to Eq. (11) from a formal point of

 view. Among other insights, their analysis provided a way to explain (Hohenberg and
 Kohn 1964)

 14 HK actually define go as the energy per unit volume rather than the energy per particle. We use the latter
 here to simplify comparison with Kohn and Sham (1965) discussed later.

 why neither the original Thomas-Fermi method.. .nor its generalizations by
 the addition of gradient terms, have correctly yielded wave-mechanical density

 oscillations, such as the density oscillations in atoms which correspond to shell

 structure, or the Friedel oscillations in alloys which are of the same general origin.

 One year later, Kohn and another post-doctoral fellow, Lu Jeu Sham, published a

 paper (Kohn and Sham 1965) which they suggested would "offer the hope of new
 progress" for the "theory of cohesive energies, elastic constants, etc. of real (i.e., inho

 mogeneous) metals and alloys." In the introduction to this paper, Kohn and Sham
 (KS) remind the reader that the Thomas-Fermi method uses the properties of a homo

 geneous electron system to study the properties of inhomogeneous electron systems.

 They then announce their goal to

 use the formalism of HK to carry this approach further... [to] obtain a set of
 self-consistent equations which include, in an approximate way, exchange and

 correlation... [and] which are analogous to the conventional Hartree equations.15

 The key insight used by KS was to partition the energy functional E[n] in a different

 way than HK had done in Eq. (9). Specifically, they wrote

 E[n] = TN[n\ + J d3r u(r)n(r) + ^J d3r J d+ Exc[n\. (13)

 The first term on the right side of Eq. (13) is the exact kinetic energy of a collection of
 non-interacting electrons with charge density «(r).16 The second and third terms are

 the same as those in Eq. (9). The final "exchange-correlation" term Exc[n] is similar
 to G\n\ in Eq. (9) in the sense that it accounts for all the energy associated with the
 electron-electron Coulomb repulsions not already counted by the classical Coulomb
 self-energy. However, where G[n] had also to account for the total kinetic energy of

 the real electron system, Exc [«] has only to account for the difference in kinetic energy

 between the real electron system an'd the non-interacting electron system. In this way,
 Eq. (13) sweeps the most difficult part of the many-body problem into the exact and
 universal (but generally unknown) functional Exc[ri\.

 Kohn and Sham proceeded to vary their expression for E\n] with respect to the

 density. However, their familiarity with the variational approach to Hartree theory17

 informed them that the very same variational principle results if one considers a set of

 Ν one-electron orbital functions <j>t(r), writes the electron number density as n(r) =

 ΣίkL ι \4>k(r)\2, and use the exact quantum mechanical expression for the kinetic energy
 of Ν non-interacting electrons assumed to occupy these orbitals:

 15 KS do not cite either the original paper by Hartree or any general review of his method. Presumably, they

 assumed that the Hartree equations were "conventional" and well-known to their readers. This is plausible,
 because their readers were mostly solid-state physicists and the standard solid-state textbook at that time
 by Seitz (1940) discusses the Hartee equations thoroughly.

 16 This differs from the approximation to the kinetic energy discussed above Eq. ( 12) which uses the kinetic

 energy of non-interacting electrons with uniform density to evaluate Eq. (11).

 17 Kohn had previously taught a class using the textbook by Seitz (1940), which reproduces the variational
 derivation of Hartree's equation in its Appendix. See Kohn (1998).

 By varying the orbitals rather than the density (just as Slater and Fock had done in
 1930), KS found that the orbitals satisfy exactly the self-consistent Hartree equations

 except that the potential v(p) in the one-particle Schrodinger equation (4) contains an
 extra term besides the external and classical Coulomb potentials. This new term comes

 from the variational derivative of the exchange-correlation energy and is explicitly a

 local function of position,

 5n(r)

 This analysis permitted KS to establish an important point of principle. If Exc [n (r)]
 is known, the exact solution of the many-body problem has the same form as (and
 is no more difficult to solve numerically than) Hartree's self-consistent equations.
 Of course, Exc[n] is not known in general (this would imply that the problem of
 interest was already solved) and KS proposed to use a local density approximation
 (LDA) based on exc (η), the exchange-correlation energy per particle of a homogeneous

 electron gas:18

 (15)

 (16)

 This suggestion could be used immediately for practical calculations because good
 approximations for exc[n] had recently been summarized by Pines (1963). KS did not

 report calculations of this kind themselves. Instead, they studied gradient corrections
 to Eq. (16), considered a Hartree-Fock-like version of their theory, and compared
 an explicit version of Eq. (16) with a local potential that had been proposed years
 earlier by Slater (1951) to approximate the non-local exchange potential. Six months
 later, Sham and one of Kohn's Ph.D. students, Bok Yin Tong, published numerical

 results for the energies and charge densities of a series of atoms using the local density

 approximation (Tong and Sham 1966). The results reported for the ionization energies
 of a sequence of oxygen ions were judged by the authors to be "in good shape"
 compared to experiment. LDA calculations became a growth industry soon thereafter.

 5 Conclusion

 This paper has chronicled how two Cambridge classmates in the 1920s, Douglas
 Hartree and Hilleth Thomas, used largely heuristic arguments to propose complemen

 tary approximate theories for the electronic structure of many-electron atoms. Both
 went on to have successful scientific careers and both made significant contributions

 In the main body of their paper, KS propose Eq. (16) at the same time that they derive their Hartree-like

 equations. A note added in proof points out that the definition of vxc(r) in Eq. (15) makes the Hartree-like
 equations formally exact.

 to numerical analysis and to computer hardware. 40 years later, Hohenberg, Kohn, and
 Sham fused and generalized the work of Hartree and Thomas to produce a formally

 exact theory applicable to any system of electrons subject to a fixed external potential.
 The circumstances that motivated Kohn and his collaborators to develop density func

 tional theory when they did, the subsequent history that attended the basic theory, the

 responses to their proposed local density approximation, and the evolving reactions

 of different segments of the physics and chemistry communities to DFT, are issues to

 be explored in future publications.
