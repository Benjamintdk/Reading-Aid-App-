 Abstract This article by Curtis Wilson is an account of the origin of Hansen's

 powerful systematic method for finding contributions of higher order perturbations
 in celestial mechanics. Hansen's method was developed in the course of improv

 ing on Laplace's treatment of the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn. This

 method, an entirely new way of doing celestial mechanics when it first appeared, later

 made possible the successful treatment of the complicated motions of our moon (see

 Wilson 2010). In this paper Wilson gives a brief historical introduction followed by an

 account of relevant technical details of the Laplacian background, an account illustrat

 ing technical details in Hansen's initial development in his Disquisitions of 1829, and a

 treatment illustrating details contributing to the achievement of Hansen's more refined

 development in his Untersuchung of 1831. These details include conditional equations

 Hansen provides for checking the accuracy of calculations. Wilson also includes a
 detailed assessment showing the extraordinary improvement in empirical accuracy of

 Hansen's treatment over the best earlier treatment of the Jupiter-Saturn interactions.

 Curtis Wilson passed away on 24 August 2012 at the age of 91. He had completed this article some time

 before. Becky Wilson, Curtis' window, asked William Harper to help arrange for publication. Harper had

 only a printed version of the manuscript, which he digitally scanned and sent to Buchwald for the Archive.

 Buchwald then asked Springer to prepare a readable version in MSWord format, including all equations as

 best could be done. The result required examination by an expert, and so Buchwald asked Andreas Verdun

 to do so. Verdun cross-checked and fixed German citations and English translations and amended a faulty

 equation. Buchwald then passed Verdun's emended version to Harper, who, aided by Sree Ram Valluri,

 completed the necessary resetting.

 1 Introduction

 "Hansen's method," an entirely new way of doing celestial mechanics when it first

 appeared, was the invention of Peter Andreas Hansen (1795-1874) in 1829-1830.

 Later, during a long, active life as both a practical and a theoretical astronomer, Hansen
 elaborated variants of his method; certain features, however, remained constant. He

 had formulated these in the course of writing a memoir entitled Disquisitiones circa

 theoriam perturbationum quae motum corporum coelestium afficiunt ("Investigations

 concerning the theory of the perturbations that influence the motion of the celes

 tial bodies"). This memoir was published in two installments in the Astronomische

 Nachrichten for September and October 1829.1

 Immediately upon completing this memoir, Hansen set about applying his new

 method to the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn. More than a year earlier, in

 July 1828, the Berlin Academy of Sciences had announced as the subject of its prize

 Hansen (1829). I shall hereinafter abbreviate Astronomische Nachrichten as A.N.

 competition for 1830, "A new investigation of the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and

 Saturn, with special regard for the terms depending on the square and higher powers

 of the perturbing forces..."2 The deadline for submission of memoirs was March 31,
 1830.3

 Hansen's method 411

 Hansen's memoir, Untersuchung iiber die gegenseitigen Storungen des Jupiters

 und Sat urns,4 reached the Berlin Academy after the deadline. Another memoir, by

 Philippe-Gustave, comte de Pontécoulant, had arrived earlier and was deemed worthy

 of the prize. Pontécoulant's memoir focused on the specific problem of calculating

 the second-order terms in the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn—an issue that

 had been the subject of a controversy (to be described later) between Giovanni Plana

 and Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1825-1826. Pontécoulant thus left unaddressed the more

 general question set for the competition: How second- and higher-order perturbations

 were to be dealt with? Hansen's memoir not only addressed this question, but was

 judged to have resolved it in a thoroughly satisfactory and indeed admirable way.

 The Academy was therefore moved to award to Hansen a prize equal to that given

 Pontécoulant, an Akademie prize medal valued at 50 ducats.5

 Pontécoulant was a student and close associate of Siméon-Denis Poisson, the fore

 most celestial mechanician in Paris after Laplace's death. Pontécoulant's memoir is

 essentially a clarification and correction of a Laplacian procedure on the basis of an

 ordering principle suggested by Poisson. Hansen's memoir, in contrast, struck out

 along a hitherto untrodden path.

 Who was this Hansen? Born in Tonder, Denmark, near the Schleswig border, he was

 the son of a silver- and goldsmith. At his father's insistence, he had learned the trade of a

 clockmaker and practiced it into his twenty-fifth year.6 Denied the possibility of attend

 ing university, he was an assiduous autodidact; achieving fluency in Latin and French

 as well as German, Danish, and Swedish, and proficiency in advanced mathematics.

 Hansen's turn to astronomy came in 1820, when the family physician put young

 Hansen in touch with the professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen,
 Heinrich Christian Schumacher (1780-1850). Schumacher at this time was primarily

 engaged in the geodetic survey of Schleswig and Holstein; in the following year, he

 would become the survey's director, and also be named the first director of the Danish

 Royal Observatory, then in process of being constructed at Altona. Hansen became

 Schumacher's assistant, thus winning release from a life of artisan toil.

 2 The Preisfrage was stated in full as follows: "Die Akademie wiinscht eine neue Untersuchung der gegen

 seitigen SttSrungen des Jupiters und Saturns zu erhalten, mit besonderer BerUcksichtigung der von dem

 Quadrate und den hôheren Potenzen der stôrenden KrSfte abhtogigen Glieder, wodurch zugleich die Ver

 schiedenheit der von den Herren Laplace und Plana gefundenen Weithe eiklSrt, und das richtige Résultat

 bewiesen wird." For this quotation, I am indebted to Dr. Wolfgang Knobloch of the Berlin-Brandenburgische

 Akademie der Wissenschaften. The reference in the final clause of the quotation to the differing values found
 by Laplace and Plana will be explained in Sect. 2.3.

 Schumacher had studied astronomy under Gauss at Gôttingen, and like Gauss

 stressed the importance of exact measurement and numerically convenient procedures;

 this emphasis would be characteristic of German astronomers influenced by Gauss,
 such as Olbers and Bessel.7 As Schumacher's assistant, Hansen was introduced to the

 practical side of astronomical and geodetic operations. He became expert in computing

 the orbits of comets by Olbers' method, and in 1824, he discovered a new and espe

 cially precise method of determining geographic latitude, by timing the transit of a star

 across the first vertical (the celestial great circle from east to west through the zenith).

 This discovery brought recognition within the astronomical community and led in

 1825 to Hansen's being appointed director of the Seeberg Observatory near Gotha, to

 succeed Johann Franz Encke (1791-1865), who was leaving that post to become direc

 tor of the Berlin Observatory. With Encke, who like Schumacher had been a student

 of Gauss, Hansen would have a close epistolary relation over the next quarter century.

 During his early years of geodetic and astronomical work, Hansen does not appear

 to have had occasion to study the problem of planetary perturbations. The earliest

 indication I have found of his concerning himself with this problem is in a letter to

 Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846), dated May 31,1828. Hansen had been brought

 into correspondence with Bessel in 1824 through his geodetic work; in the cited letter,
 he addresses Bessel as "mein hochverehrter Freund!" (As we shall see later, Hansen in

 his study of perturbations will employ Bessel functions and make use of mechanical

 quadratures as advocated by Bessel.) Amidst other topics it touches upon, Hansen's

 letter contains the following remarks concerning the mutual perturbations of Jupiter,

 Saturn, and Uranus (my translation from Hansen's original):8

 Much that has been discovered in recent years appears to disagree with what

 were previously accepted as true laws of nature, but in my opinion no judgment
 should be made before we have tested what pertains to the older established

 views. To this end I believe I shall make a contribution if I subject the theories of

 Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus to a new revision, since among the older planets these

 present the most complicated phenomena. I have been occupied with this work
 since last summer, and it is now nearly completed. The method I have applied

 differs from Laplace's. In the motion of Uranus I have found two inequalities, of

 which the one has a coefficient of 35 and the other a coefficient of 7 sexagesimal

 7 See Grattan-Guinness (1990). Vol. 1, pp. 386-387 ("Interlude 641.1").

 8 In the Akademiearchiv of the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften are 76 letters from

 Hansen to Encke, and 33 from Hansen to Bessel. The German of the passage of which I give the translation

 is as follows (quoted with permission): Es ist in den letzten Jahren so manches entdeckt, welches gegen

 die bisher als wahr angenommenen Naturgesetze zu streiten scheint, allein wir dtirfen kein Urtheil fallenf,]

 bevor wir das Alte gehiirig geprtift haben. Einen Beitrag hierzu glaube ich zu liefem[,] wenn ich die Theorie

 des Jupiters, Satums und Uranus einer neuen Durchsicht unterwerfe, da gerade unter den altera Planeten
 diese die verwickel[t]sten Erscheinungen darbieten. Diese Arbeit hat mich schon seit vorigem Sommer

 beschâftigt und ist jetzt beinahe vollendet. Ich habe eine andere Methode als la Place angewandt. In der
 Bewegung des Uranus habe ich zwei Ungleichheiten gefunden, deren eine 35" und deren andere 7" (sex.)
 zum Coefficienten hat. Diese kônnen aber die bekannte Anomalie nicht fortschaffen, indess finde ich es

 mehr als wahrscheinlich anzunehmen[,] dass es ausserhalb des Uranus einen Oder mehrere Planeten sind,

 durch welche diese Anomalie hervorgebracht ist. In der Bewegung des Jupiters und des Satums habe ich

 auch mehrere nicht unbedeutende Stôrungen gefunden[,] welche von la Place ilbergangen sind....

 seconds. These cannot be reduced to the known anomalies, and I find it more

 than likely to assume that outside Uranus there are one or more planets that cause

 these anomalies. In the motion of Jupiter and Saturn I have also found several

 not inconsiderable perturbations which were passed over by Laplace....

 Hansen has apparently derived the new inequalities he has found in Uranus from

 observations. He goes on to incorporate these and the newly found perturbations of

 Jupiter and Saturn in expressions for the secular changes in the eccentricities and

 perihelia of the three planets and to compare his results with those given by Laplace.

 Without knowing the method that Hansen applies here, we can be fairly sure it

 differs importantly from the method of the Disquisitiones that he will be elaborating

 a year later. In the letter just cited, Hansen is obtaining perturbations of two orbital

 elements, the eccentricity and longitude of the perihelion, whereas in the method of

 the Disquisitiones, he will be computing the perturbations, not of orbital elements, but

 of the planetary coordinates. For Hansen, the announcement of the prize contest no

 doubt stimulated a new and penetrating consideration of the planetary problem; the

 central ideas of the Disquisitiones may not have come into view for him till after the
 announcement.

 The opening section of the Disquisitiones outlines the inconveniences of the ear

 lier methods of computing perturbations; evidently Hansen was acquainted with the

 literature of celestial mechanics. But the Disquisitiones does not apply the method it

 describes ; it sets forth a program of action—a program the success of which, as Hansen

 later acknowledged, was at the time of his writing of the Disquisitiones still uncer

 tain.9 The prize contest that led to his writing of his prize paper, the Untersuchung,

 was entirely welcome as offering an opportunity to test his ideas.

 After publication of the Disquisitiones and Untersuchung , wider recognition of
 the power and efficacy of Hansen's method was slow in coming. In 1834, in a note

 inserted in the Connaissance des terns for 1836, Pontécoulant questioned the accu

 racy of Hansen's calculation of the great inequality of Jupiter;10 Hansen in his reply
 demonstrated that Pontécoulant's critique was badly flawed.11 In a memoir in the Con

 naissance des terns for 1837, Pontécoulant claimed to give "une idée juste et claire"

 of Hansen's method;12 Hansen found the account inadequate and misleading, in par

 ticular because it failed to mention the rigorous applicability of the method to pertur

 bations of higher order than the first—"one of its chief advantages."13 John Lubbock

 in Part IV of his Theory of the Moon advised Hansen to turn his efforts to evaluating

 the correctness of the analytic formulas of Plena's lunar theory, recently published.14

 The advice, Hansen countered, showed total incomprehension of his endeavor. Plana's
 analytic formulas, in Hansen's view, were worse than useless because of their slow

 convergence; his own procedures avoided this difficulty by substituting numerical

 values at an early stage.15

 Hansen's Fundamenta nova investigationis orbitae verae quam luna perlustrat,

 applying his method to the lunar theory, appeared in 1838.16 The initial response

 appears to have been slight. At last, over a decade later, the work received critical
 and laudatory comment from two mathematicians. C.G.J. Jacobi wrote two letters

 to Hansen, which were published posthumously in Jacobi's Mathematische Werke

 (1851). A few of Hansen's formulations, Jacobi there showed, were improper from
 a formal mathematical standpoint, but he went on to praise "the easy and elegant

 way in which you have arrived at a unique and remarkable form of the perturbational

 equations."17 In line with Jacobi's remarks, Arthur Cayley in a paper of 1857 undertook

 "to exhibit, in as clear a form as may be, the investigation of the remarkable equations
 for the motion of the moon established in Hansen's Fundamenta nova..."18 In the

 measurement of longitudes in the varying plane of a planet's or satellite's orbit, and

 in the determination of the position of the lunar orbit with respect to the varying plane

 of the Earth's path, most earlier derivations, Cayley asserted, were very imperfect. "I

 except always Hansen's Fundamenta Nova where the points referred to are treated in

 a perfectly rigorous manner."19 Cayley's reformulation of the basic propositions of

 Hansen's method has been followed by later expositors.20

 In 1857, Hansen's Tables de la lune construites d'après le principe newtonien de

 la gravitation universelle were published by the British Government. Tested against

 observations, they proved the most accurate of the available tables. They were conse

 quently adopted as the basis of the lunar ephemerides in the British Nautical Almanac

 and in the French Connaissance des terns beginning with the volumes for 1862; they

 replaced the semi-empirical tables of J.K. Burckhardt, published in 1812. The Amer
 ican Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac from its inception in 1855 had used Ben
 jamin Peirce's lunar tables drawn from a revision of Plana's theory, but in 1883, the
 Americans followed the European example in adopting Hansen's tables. These tables,

 with minor adjustments by Simon Newcomb, would remain the basis of the national

 ephemerides through 1922.

 Hansen's method was used in one more major application during the nineteenth
 century. When Simon Newcomb became head of the US Nautical Almanac Office

 in 1877, he had conceived the aim of reforming all the planetary tables, using a

 consistent system of constants. (Leverrier's tables, then in process of appearing, were

 deficient in this regard.) The most difficult of the problems was presented by the mutual

 perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn. For its resolution, Newcomb turned to George

 William Hill, a colleague of his at the Nautical Almanac Office, whom he regarded

 as "easily...the greatest master of mathematical astronomy during the last quarter of

 the nineteenth century."21 Hill's application of Hansen's method to Jupiter and Saturn

 was carried out entirely by himself and occupied the years from 1882 to 1890.

 The one defect in Hill's makeup, Newcomb proclaimed, was his lack of the teaching

 Hansen's method 415

 faculty.

 Had this been developed in him, I could have learned very much from him that

 would have been to my advantage. In saying this I have one especial point in mind.

 In beginning my studies in celestial mechanics, I lacked the guidance of some

 one conversant with the subject on its practical side. Two systems of computing

 planetary perturbations had been used, one by Leverrier, while the other was

 invented by Hansen. The former was, in principle, of great simplicity, while the

 latter seemed to be very complex and even clumsy. I naturally supposed that

 the man who computed the direction of the planet Neptune before its existence

 was known, must be a master of the whole subject, and followed the lines he

 indicated. I gradually discovered the contrary, and introduced modified methods,

 but did not entirely break away from the old trammels. Hill had never been bound

 by them, and used Hansen's method from the beginning. Had he given me a few

 demonstrations of its advantages, I should have been saved a great deal of time
 and labor.22

 Newcomb's complaint is not the only testimony to Hill's "lack of the teaching

 faculty."23 But the demand for "a few demonstrations of the advantages" of Hansen's

 method is not easy to fulfill. Hansen himself seems to have "lacked the teaching

 faculty": his weakness as an expositor has been frequently complained of.24

 In the present essay, I seek to shed light on the original conception of Hansen's

 method. My central concern is with the train of Hansen's mathematical thought and

 the interconnection of his main ideas, rather than with the full technicality of his

 method. In order to provide the appropriate context, I begin with a sketch of Laplace's

 method for planetary perturbations as described in the Mé canique céleste, undertaking
 to show why it took the form it did, and why it had "inconveniences" (Hansen's term).

 2 The Laplacian background

 2.1 Laplace's method for perturbations and its application to die mutual

 perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn

 In Book Π, Chapter VI of the Mécanique cé leste, Laplace sets forth the method he uses

 for determining the planetary perturbations of the zeroth and first order with respect

 to the orbital eccentricities—the inequalities he determines first. Earlier, in Section

 20 of Chapter III, he has derived the following standard expressions for the elliptical

 motion of a planet subject solely to the gravitational force of the Sun:

 vector in the orbital plane, a the semi-transverse axis, ae the orbital eccentricity, m

 the longitude of the perihelion, and ν the true anomaly. Equation (2.1a) ("Kepler's

 equation") is transcendental, that is, not soluble in closed algebraic form. Laplace
 obtains for Ε the infinite series

 5!24 1.2

 With Ε calculated to the order of some chosen power of the eccentricity, ν can be
 found from substitution of Ε into (2.1b), and r/a can be found from substitution of υ

 into (2.1c). For the analytic development of his method, however, Laplace uses the

 following series for r!a and v:25

 r e2 \ 3e3l / s fe2 e4l
 a = ~2 8~ j C0S '(ηί ε — Γσ) — ^ 3~J

 • cos -2 (nt + ε - m) - &c·;

 ν = nt + ε + ^2e - j · sin · (nt + ε - m) +

 • sin -2 (nt + ε - m) + &c. (2.4)

 Here ε is the mean longitude at epoch, and m the longitude of the perihelion, so

 that nt + ε is the mean longitude, and nt + ε - τπ the mean anomaly. The orbital

 eccentricities of the planets being relatively small, Laplace assures his readers that

 the first few terms from these series are generally sufficient to match the precision
 attainable in observations. Equations (2.3) and (2.4) are presupposed in Laplace's

 calculation of planetary perturbations in Chapter VI.

 In order to obtain the simplest expression of the planetary perturbations, Laplace

 employs the "perturbing function" introduced by Lagrange: a potential function

 whence the perturbative forces in the direction of any coordinate can be derived by

 differentiation with respect to that coordinate. He calls it R, and for a single perturbing

 planet defines it by

 R _ m'■ (xx'+ yy'+ zz') ^

 (.χ'2 + y'2 + z/2)3/2 [(λ' - χ)2 + (y' - y)2 + (ζ' - ζ)2]1/2

 where m' is the mass of the perturbing planet (to be evaluated eventually as a fraction

 of the Sun's mass M taken as the unit); x, y, ζ are the rectangular coordinates of the

 perturbed planet, and (x\ y', z') those of the perturbing planet.26 The function R proves

 to be independent of the position of the xy plane. Shifting to polar coordinates, with r,

 r' as the radii vectores, and the orbital plane of m assumed to lie in the xy plane at epoch,

 so that ζ remains small and of the order of the perturbing force, Laplace expands R as

 an infinite series. The expansion is "very converging," because the orbits are nearly

 circles and the orbital planes little inclined to one another. A typical term is of the form

 m'k · cos · (i'n't - int + iV - is - g\m - gim' - gtf - gtf'),

 where θ, Θ', are the longitudes of the ascending nodes of the two orbits in the xy plane;

 k is a constant depending on the eccentricities, inclinations, nodes, perihelia, trans

 verse axes, etc., and i, i', g, g2, gsg4 are integers. The differential equations giving the

 perturbed values of the radius vector r, the longitude v, and the tangent of the latitude

 s are then expressed in terms of derivatives of R.

 In Chapter VI, Laplace limits his solution of these differential equations to the

 order of the first power of the perturbing forces. That is, both m and m' are initially
 conceived as moving in ellipses in accordance with Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) above, and

 only the effects on m produced by m' are determined. Let (r), (v), and (s) represent

 the elliptical values of the radius vector, longitude, and tangent of the latitude of the

 perturbed planet. In a calculation to the first power of the perturbing forces, we obtain

 the perturbed coordinates of m in the form r = (r) + Sr, ν = (υ) + Sv, s = (s) + Ss,

 where Sr, Sv, Ss are the changes produced by perturbation due to m' (which is still

 conceived as moving in an unperturbed elliptical orbit).

 Were the calculation to be carried to the second power of the perturbing forces, it

 would be necessary to determine additional effects: m, moving in accordance with its

 first-order perturbations, is perturbed differently than it would be if its motion were

 purely elliptical, and m', having been perturbed by m, perturbs m differently than it

 would if its motion were purely elliptical. According to Laplace, "in the theory of

 the planets and comets, we may neglect these squares and products [of the perturbing

 forces] except in a few terms of that order, which are rendered sensible by particular

 circumstances..."27 The chief "particular circumstance" Laplace had in mind here, as

 we shall see, was a near-commensurability between the motions of the perturbed and

 the perturbing planets.

 neglected in relation to M. The boldface d in dR signifies differentiation solely with

 respect to the coordinates of the perturbed planet. (In practice, when the coordinates

 have been expressed as series in sines or cosines of the mean longitude, this means

 differentiation with respect to t in the product ni.) From (2.6), Laplace derives for Sr

 Hansen's method 419

 According to Laplace, "the system of equations (Χ1), (Y), (Z') will give in a very simple

 manner the motion of m, taking notice only of the first power of the disturbing force.

 The consideration of the terms of this order, is very nearly sufficient in the theory of

 the planets.. ."31 To terms independent of the eccentricities or proportional to their first

 powers, Laplace undertakes to apply equations (Χ')» (Τ). (Z') systematically, down to

 terms in the longitude with coefficients of 0.081 of a sexagesimal arcsecond (=0.25
 centesimal second).

 For terms of the second and higher orders with respect to the eccentricities and with

 respect to γ (the tangent of the mutual inclination of the orbits of the perturbing and

 perturbed planets), a similar procedure, Laplace urges, would be wasteful of time and

 labor. As he explains,

 The great number of inequalities depending on the squares of the eccentricities,

 and of the inclinations, makes it troublesome to compute all of them...32

 The difficulty here is to select, prior to detailed computation, the terms likely to

 prove observationally detectable. Small divisors resulting from the integration of the

 equations influence the size of the coefficients of these terms in a nonlinear way.

 To illustrate: Many of the terms in R leading to terms depending on the squares and

 products of the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits are of the form:33

 R = M ■ cos · {i · (n't — nt + ε' - e) + 2nt + X}.

 Here Af is a multinomial constant, the individual terms of which are proportional to

 e2, ee\ e'2, y2; Κ is a constant depending on ε, ax, m', and Π (the longitude of the

 ascending node of the orbit of m' on the orbit of m), and i takes on all integral values,

 positive, zero, and negative. On substituting this term in Eq. (2.6), and integrating,
 Laplace obtains34

 (2.8)

 In (2.7) and (2.8), denominators containing the integer i influence the size of the

 coefficients in which they occur. If the perturbed planet is Jupiter and the perturbing

 planet Saturn, then n':n & 2:5. If in the expression [i · n! + (3 — i) · n] which appears
 in the denominator of (2.7) we substitute i = 5, it becomes 5n! - 2n, which is about

 n/74. In this case, therefore, rSr/a2 becomes especially large. As a result, the first

 term of Sv, whose value depends on rSr/a2, will also be large. For the same planets,

 the term in Sv with the denominator [i - n' + (2 - i) ■ n]2 has its largest value when

 i = 3. Thus, for any given pair of perturbed and perturbing planets, each term must
 be examined to see how different choices of i affect its size.

 For terms proportional to powers or products of higher dimensions of the eccentric

 ities and inclinations, the problem of identifying all terms that will be observationally

 significant presents similar difficulties.

 It was in the mid- 1780s, in a renewed attempt to resolve a major unexplained anom

 aly in planetary motion, that Laplace came to focus on the role of small divisors. Since

 Kepler's time, the mean motion of Jupiter had appeared to be slowly increasing, and that

 of Saturn slowly decreasing. Halley in his planetary tables, published posthumously

 in 1749, had postulated a secular acceleration for Jupiter and a secular deceleration
 for Saturn—a term in each case proportional to the time squared. Early in the 1770s,

 Laplace had shown that, if a term proportional to t2 was assumed to be produced in the

 mean motion of a planet by gravitational interaction with a perturbing planet, its coef

 ficient, calculated to the order of the first power of the perturbing masses and the third

 power of the eccentricities, would be identically zero. He concluded, unwarrantedly as

 later became clear, that the apparent changes in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn

 were not due to their gravitational interaction. Lagrange in a memoir of 1774—not

 directly responding to Laplace's memoir—pointed out that apparent changes in the
 mean motion, inferred from observations covering a limited period, or widely sepa

 rated in time but fortuitously chosen, could appear to be proportional to t2 without

 being strictly so; they could arise from an oscillatory inequality of long period.

 This possibility, as Laplace at length discovered in 1785, proved to be the key to the

 anomalous apparent changes in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn. He announced

 his resolution of the problem to the Paris Academy of Sciences in November of that

 year. The small divisor involved was (5n! — 2n).36 A perturbational term proportional
 to M ■ sin(5n't - 2nt + A), where M and A are constants, goes through its full cycle

 36 For an extended account of the history of this problem, see Wilson (1985).

 of values in 360°/(5n' - In) & 900 years. For either planet, seventeenth-century and

 early eighteenth-century observational values could appear to fit a monotonie secular

 change proportional to t2.

 The coefficient Mean be shown to consist ofterms proportional to e3, eV, ee'2, e'3,

 ey2, e'y2, where e, e' are the orbital eccentricities of the two planets, and y
 is the inclination of the two orbital planes to one another. These products are
 small fractions, equal to about 1/8,000 or less. Because of their smallness, and

 the formidable labor of computing the parts of the coefficient M, a term of the
 form Msin(5n'f - 2nt + A) had never been computed before Laplace did so
 in 1785. He saw that, because of the double-integration involved in solving the

 differential equations, the coefficient of such a term would have for divisor the
 small factor (5n' - 2n)2; hence, M might prove large enough to make the term
 observationally detectable. Only an extended calculation could decide the ques
 tion. Carrying it out, Laplace found for Jupiter 20/49".5 sin(5n'i - 2nt + A) and for
 Saturn -48'44"sin(5n't - 2nt + A), the coefficients being for the epoch 1750.37

 (The coefficients are subject to secular change, owing to secular changes in the orbital

 elements.) The above terms represent the largest perturbational inequalities in the solar

 system and are referred to as "the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn."

 Laplace incorporated these inequalities into the mean motions of the two planets.

 He justified this step by showing that, if elliptical values are substituted for r and ν

 in equations (Jf) and (T), and account is taken solely of terms leading to a double

 integration, including those with (5n' - 2n)2 as divisor, then Sr and Sv prove to be

 given by the equations:38

 \ndt / M + mJ J

 sv= init Ur.

 \ndt) M + mJ J

 (2.9)

 Now (~jy) is the elliptical value of the rate of change of the radius vector r per unit

 of change in the mean motion, and (fy) is the elliptical value of the rate of change
 of the true longitude ν per unit change of the mean motion. In both cases, a rate is

 multiplied by the factor [3a/{M 4- m)] f ndt f dR, evaluated for the particular term
 of R yielding the denominator (5n' - In)2. The product must give the change in r or

 ν due to the particular term of R considered.

 The incorporation of -jj— · / ndt f dR for R = M [(5n' -2n)t + A] into the
 mean motion produces increments in (r) and (v) equal to those obtained by computing

 Sr and Sv from (2.9). But the procedure has a further effect. The mean motion becomes

 a variable quantity, varying with only some of the inequalities, those of very long

 period. Laplace continues to calculate the other inequalities, those of shorter period,

 in his usual way, adding them to (r) and (v). These inequalities are, at the end of the

 calculation, stated in terms of the mean motion, which is no longer simply proportional

 to the time, but incorporates a sinusoidal variation.

 The first to question this procedure on logical grounds appears to have been G.W.

 Hill, in the 1890s. Was Laplace's procedure for long-period inequalities consistent

 with his procedure for computing ordinary, short-period inequalities?

 In the Mécanique céleste Laplace had determined all long-period inequalities

 as if they were to be applied to the mean longitude, and had so directed they

 should, while the short-period ones were derived as if they were to be added to

 the true longitude. There is, therefore, a want of congruity, and even of rigor, in

 this way of proceeding. For Laplace has nowhere shown how these two modes

 of application can be employed in unison. It is plain there would be as many

 methods of perturbations as there were opinions as to the dividing line separating

 long from short-period inequalities.39

 It was Hill's belief that Hansen, too, had been struck by the incongruity of Laplace's

 treating long-period inequalities in one way, and short-period inequalities in another,
 and had been thus led to the invention of his new method in celestial mechanics;

 but evidence on this point is lacking. The objection to Laplace's procedure on log

 ical grounds was repeated by Brouwer and Clemence in their Methods of Celestial
 Mechanics.40

 No such objection, certainly, occurred to Laplace in 1785. He was excited by the

 prospect of a stunning success. If he could identify and calculate all the divisors small

 enough to produce observationally detectable terms, he would resolve a long-standing

 anomaly, demonstrate at last that universal gravity was sufficient to account for the

 motions of the celestial bodies, and achieve the most accurate theory of Jupiter and

 Saturn ever constructed. Laplace, I suspect, was intensely focussed on the achievement

 of a coup.

 With insight and effort, he achieved this coup. In his Théorie de Jupiter et de Saturne,

 published in 1788,41 he reduced the errors in the theories of these two planets to less

 than 2 arcminutes. The extent of his triumph is evident from a table he gives, comparing

 the errors of his theory of Saturn with those of Hailey's tables, for 43 oppositions of

 Saturn observed from 1582 to 1786 42 The maximum deviation of Hailey's tables from

 the observations is —22' 17", while that of Laplace's theory is +1'52". If we compute

 the standard deviations of the errors, we find 545".9 for Hailey's tables and 60".7

 for Laplace's theory, a ninefold improvement. In a comparison of his theory with a

 Babylonian observation of 228 B.C., Laplace found a deviation of only -55".5.

 In presenting a draft of his memoir to the Paris Academy on May 10,1786, Laplace

 noted that the earlier oppositions with which he had compared his theory, and on the
 basis of which he had determined its constants, had not been corrected for the aberration

 of light or nutation, or for mistakes in the star positions from which the planetary

 positions were computed. The astronomer Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre (1749—

 1822) offered to carry out the necessary corrections, and the result was Delambre's

 Tables de Jupiter et de Saturne, published in 1789, a book of 109 pages that includes

 an account of the procedures used; the tables alone were republished in Vol. I of the

 third edition of Lalande's Astronomie in (1792).43 Delambre's values for the aphelia,

 eccentricities, and mean longitudes of the two planets in 1750, as compared with

 modern values for the same date, show moderate to considerable improvements over

 Laplace's values. In the Lalande volume, it is claimed that positions of Jupiter deduced

 from the tables never differ from observation by as much as 30 arcseconds.44

 The improvement effected by Delambre from the side of the observations no doubt

 encouraged Laplace to push further the refinement of the theory. The comparison with

 observations, to be sure, could not guarantee the exactitude of any particular term.

 What was compared with observations was the totality of the theoretical terms. The

 presumption was that still greater closeness of fit could be achieved from either side—

 by selecting or obtaining observations of superior precision, and bringing them to bear

 more incisively on the determination of the constants that have to be established empiri

 cally, and by a more accurate deduction of the consequences of the gravitational theory.

 And thus, when preparing Volume III of the Mécanique céleste—the volume that

 contains the theories of all the planets, numerically calculated—Laplace set out to

 revise and refine his theory of Jupiter and Saturn. Alexis Bouvard (1767-1843) assisted

 him in the new calculations. A number of perturbational terms hitherto omitted were

 now computed. These included terms proportional to products of five dimensions in
 the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits45 and a number of terms of the second

 order with respect to the perturbing forces.46

 Having incorporated the "great inequalities" of Jupiter and Saturn into their respec

 tive mean motions, Laplace represents the new mean motions, thus rendered variable,

 by ζ, ζ'. Each of these comprises a part strictly proportional to the time and a part

 varying sinusoidally in accordance with the "great inequality." Thus, we may write

 ζ = not + δζ and ζ' = n'Qt + δζ', where no, n'0 aie the truly mean rates of mean
 motion, and δζ, δζ' are the sinusoidally varying parts, given by

 S(' (210)

 Between the two quantities δζ, δζ', Laplace obtains a quantitative relation, such that

 when he has computed the value of one of them, the value of the other is derivable in a

 single step. To obtain this relation, he starts from the equation stating the conservation

 of forces vives and neglects all terms except those which are of the order of the squares

 or products of the masses m and m!, and have (i'n' ~ in)2 as divisor. He thus finds that

 Here, as before, dR signifies the derivative of R solely with respect to the coordinates

 of m\ and d'R' signifies the derivative of R' solely with respect to the coordinates of

 m!. Now R, and therefore f dR as well, is computed only to the order of m'; similarly,

 R' and f d'R' are computed only to the order of m. It follows, according to Laplace,

 that in evaluating these integrals, we may suppose the elements of the elliptical motion
 to be constant.47 Hence

 Replacing the integrals in (2.12) by means of (2.10) yields

 It was this relation, Laplace tells us, that first led him to conclude that gravitational

 interaction was the cause of the apparent secular changes in the mean motions of

 Jupiter and Saturn; Halley's values for these changes were very nearly in the ratio

 given by (2.13).48

 The general applicability of (2.13) in the derivation of perturbations of the second

 order with respect to the perturbing forces will become a question in the 1820s, as we

 shall see. Of the terms of the second order that Laplace computes, we focus here on

 those related to the great inequality; it is concerning these that questions will later be
 raised.

 First, he computes a second-order term that the great inequality implies, which

 has the argument 10ζ' - 4ζ, hence half the period of the great inequality. To obtain

 it, he returns to the first equation of (2.10) and considers in R a term of the form
 m'k · cos -(5Ç' — 2ζ + A), where A is a constant, and k is a function of the elements

 of the elliptic motions of m and m'. (Since k is a function of the elliptical elements, it like

 them is subject to a secular change, which we here leave out of account.) The derivative

 d/? will be given by (9/?/3f)(d£/df)di. Evidently, dR/Βζ — 2m!k · sin(5f'-2£+A);
 but what is df/df? Laplace writes ζ = J ndt and d£ = ndi, as if η were a variable

 rate, but then proceeds to treat it as a constant, which, to be sure, it approximately is.
 He therefore finds d R = 2m' -k-ndt ■ sin -(5ζ' -2ζ + A). His task then becomes the

 integration of

 In the second line of (2.14), I have followed Laplace in neglecting m relative to M,

 setting M — 1, and transferring the quantities that are constant in the elliptic motion

 from the integrand into the coefficient.

 The first-order integral of (2.14) is obtained if we substitute for ζ, ζ' their average

 values nt and n't (I here, with Laplace, take n, n! to be the constant parts of the two

 rates of 'mean motion'), then integrate. Thus

 Thus, each term in δ R arises from a product of a partial derivative of R with respect

 to a given variable and a perturbation of this same variable. For instance, R contains a

 term representable by M® · ea · cos(3n't — nt + C), where M(0), C are constants. The

 partial derivative of this term with respect to r, multiplied by <5r, can be represented

 Hansen's method 427

 But Sr contains a term of the form a ■ F -cos (nf — 2 n't + D), where F, D are constants;
 hence (2.18) will contain a product of the two cosines. By the trigonometric identity

 cos A · cos Β = ^ · cos(A + B) + - ■ cos(A - Β),

 the product of the two cosines will give two terms of which one will be proportional

 to cos(5n'i — 2nt + G), that is, a term contributing to the great inequality.

 Laplace computes all the second-order terms deriving from a term in R proportional

 to cos(3n't -nt + const.) and from a perturbation of a coordinate (Sr, Sv, Sr', etc.)

 proportional to (sin/cos)[n? - 2n't + const.], and reciprocally, the terms deriving

 from a term in R proportional to cos (nt — 2n't + const.) and from a perturbation of a

 coordinate proportional to (sin/cos)[3n'f—nt+const.].50 No doubt he chooses factors

 with these particular arguments, because the first-order inequalities involving these

 same arguments are large for both planets. In the case of Saturn, he asserts, the sum of

 all these contributions constitutes "the most sensible term of the great inequality...,

 depending on the square of the disturbing force."51

 Letting T5 = 5n't-2nt+5ε' - 2ε, we can represent his net result for the longitude

 of Saturn in 1750 by52

 Sv' = —3".8165sin-75 + 42".9203 cos-75. (2.19)

 As the corresponding term for Jupiter, he gives53

 Sv = l".64166 · sin T5 - 18".46195 cos T5 (2.20)

 Has Laplace considered all the second-order terms large enough to affect predictions

 significantly? The text of the Mécanique céleste provides no basis for answering this

 question. Laplace asserts that one term or another must be taken into account, or shows

 that such and such another term is negligible, without providing any discussion of still

 other terms neglected. In the 1830s, Pontécoulant defended Laplace's "marvelous tact

 in distinguishing, amidst all these inequalities, the multiplicity of which constitutes the

 principal difficulty of the theory of the planetary motions, those which must acquire

 detectable values and those which will remain forever negligible...;"54 but at the

 same time, he acknowledged that Laplace gave the wrong sign to the major second
 order term, and failed to compute other terms that needed to be taken into account.55

 Bowditch in his commentary could say that "several terms, omitted by the author,.. .are

 quite as important as those which he has retained."56 As we shall see, (2.19) and (2.20)

 are badly in error. Years later G.W. Hill remarked that, "In all previous investigations

 [prior to Hansen's] it is impossible to form a conception of the probable magnitude of

 the terms passed over on account of the habit of the investigator of selecting here and

 there a term to be computed."57

 2.2 Bouvard's tables for Jupiter and Saturn

 In 1808, Bouvard published his Nouvelles Tables de Jupiter et de Saturne·,58 they

 were based essentially on the theory of the Mécanique Céleste. The fate of these

 tables is briefly related in the first paragraph of the Introduction to a revised set of

 tables prepared by Bouvard and published in 1821:

 A short time after the printing of my Tables de Jupiter et de Saturne, M. de

 Laplace, on reviewing the theory of these two planets, found that the great

 inequality depending on the fifth powers of the eccentricities had been taken

 analytically with the wrong sign. This equation has a large influence on the

 value of the elliptic elements, and notably on the mean longitude at epoch and

 on the mean motion. Consequently, my Tables would not long continue to rep

 resent the observations accurately. In such a circumstance, there was only one

 course to follow, and I did not hesitate. I took up my work once again, to bring

 it to the level of the changes that theory had confirmed, and I have profited from

 the occasion by introducing other improvements that experience has indicated
 to me.59

 In his first tables, Bouvard had employed the oppositions of Jupiter and Saturn

 deduced from the observations of La Caille, Bradley, and Maskelyne from 1747 to
 1804, and those of the Observatoire de Paris from 1800 to 1804. For the second tables,

 he made use as well of all the quadratures furnished by the same observers, and in

 addition, all the oppositions and quadratures observed in Paris from 1804 to 1814. And

 for the first time, in the differential correction of the elliptical elements, he applied the

 method of least squares. On pages vii-xii of his Introduction, he supplies lists of the

 two sets of equations of condition, for Jupiter and for Saturn, where an equation of

 condition corresponds to each observation, and the error—the difference between the

 observation and the theoretical position—is given in each case. Of the latter Bouvard

 says:

 The last column presents the errors of the Tables, expressed in centesimal seconds

 [one centesimal second = 0.324 sexagesimal second]. For Jupiter, only one goes

 as high as 45" [«» 16 sexagesimal seconds], 14 are less than 40", and the others,

 much smaller, are alternately positive or negative for several years running. In
 Saturn's case, the errors are smaller; three only are between 30" and 40"; the

 others are very small, and generally behave like those of Jupiter.60

 Hansen's method 429

 Thus, the maximum errors of Bouvard's tables are about half those of Delambre's

 tables, a significant reduction. On the other hand, the fact that the errors go positive

 or negative for several years running—that there are "runs" of some length—is an

 indication that the errors are not purely random, but include systematic error. It follows

 that the theory has not been developed to the point of accounting for all the variations

 detected observationally. Bouvard seems unaware of, or at (east untroubled by, this

 consequence.

 To exhibit the non-random character of the residuals, I conducted a "Runs Test"

 on each of the lists of residuals.61 This test is based on the theory of Bernoulli trials

 and requires as data only the number of positive residuals, the number of negative

 residuals, and the number of runs, that is, sequences of successive residuals that are

 all positive or all negative. The result of the test is given as a "p value," which tells

 in what proportion of cases, assuming randomness, such a result would occur. For

 Jupiter I found:

 For Saturn:

 Number of + residuals 79 ι
 Number of - residuals 67

 Number of run 48 ρ value 0.00002

 Number of + residuals 72

 Number of - residuals 65

 Number of run 48 ρ value 0.00031

 On the assumption of randomness, therefore, the number of runs for Jupiter should

 occur in only two out of 100,000 cases and those for Saturn in only 31 out of 100,000

 cases.

 The Bouvard tables were nevertheless used for the ephemerides of the British
 Nautical Almanac from 1834 to 1877 in the case of Jupiter, and from 1834 to 1

 879 in the case of Saturn. They were then replaced by Leverrier's tables, which were

 in turn replaced by G.W. Hill's Hansenian tables in 1900.62

 2.3 Plana's critique, Laplace's response; clarifications by Poisson and Pontécoulant

 Giovanni Plana (1781-1864), formerly a student at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris,

 from 1811 professor of astronomy at the University of T\irin, and from 1813 director of

 the observatory in Turin, on December 9,1825, presented to the Astronomical Society

 of London a Mémoire sur différens Points relatifs à la Théorie des Perturbations des

 Planètes exposée dans la Mécanique céleste.63 Each of its five chapters critiques a

 494-499. In this matter, I gratefully acknowledge the guidance of Professor Gary Fowler of the Department

 different passage in Laplace's Mécanique céleste, entering in each case into the detail

 of the relevant computations. The fourth chapter treats the second-order contributions

 to the coefficient of the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn.64

 After giving Laplace's numerical results for these contributions [see Eqs. (2.19)

 and (2.20) above],65 Plana remarks on the "distance" between these results and the

 analytic formulas of section 16 (=Celestial Mechanics, III, 129-147) from which they

 have presumably been derived: Laplace has suppressed the intermediary calculations.

 Also, in section 16, Laplace has omitted, without explanation, terms that, analytically

 speaking, are of the same order as those he includes. Finally, he has used the relation

 given by equation (2.13) above to derive (2.20) from (2.19) above, thus avoiding the

 direct calculation of the second-order term for Jupiter. But Plana claims to have found,

 a posteriori, that relation (2.13) does not hold for all perturbations of the second order

 with respect to the perturbing forces. For these several reasons, Plana undertakes a

 direct calculation of the second-order terms for Jupiter that he believes large enough

 to require being taken into account.

 First, he computes the perturbation for which Laplace had obtained (2.20), but

 without using the relation (2.13).66 The Laplacian result for Jupiter as perturbed by
 Saturn, with Saturn's mass corrected (see footnote 64), is

 δζ = l".5703 · sin T5 - 17".6598 · cos T5.

 Plana's direct computation yielded

 8ζ = —1".2462 · sin T5 + 4".8141 · cos T5. (2.21)

 Here the first coefficient differs from Laplace's value by -2".81 65, and the second

 by +22".4739: not a negligible difference!

 Next, Plana considers a second-order term that Laplace had neglected.67 Each

 second-order perturbation, we recall, arises from a sum of products, the factors of

 each product being a partial derivative of R with respect to a given variable, and a

 perturbation of this same variable (see Eq. 2.17 above). The cosines or sines contained

 in the two factors must have arguments such that their sum or difference gives T5 =
 (5n't - 2nt + 5ε' - 2ε), and be of the lowest order possible with respect to the
 eccentricities and inclinations, so that the sum of the exponents of these factors equals

 3. In the second-order perturbation computed by Laplace, the two arguments were
 3n't - nt + const., and nt - 2n't + const. In the second-order perturbation now

 computed by Plana, the two arguments are An't - nt + const., and n't - nt + const.,

 and he obtains as the sum of all the contributions to this perturbation,

 64 Chapter 4 occupies pp. 368-406 of the memoir cited in the preceding note.

 65 After publication of the Mécanique Céleste, Laplace had authorized a reduction in the mass of Saturn from

 1/3359.4 to 1/3512 of the mass of the Sun. Plana, therefore, to correct the coefficients for Jupiter (as given

 in equation 1.20 above), sets out to multiply them by the fraction 3359.4/3512. His result, 1".5703 sin .7s -

 18".0710cos T5, is in error because the second coefficient should be -17.6598.

 66 The computation occupies pp. 371-392 of Plana's memoir.

 67 This computation occupies pp. 392-397 of Plana's memoir.

 Hansen's method 431

 δζ = —0".6738 · sin T5 + 0".7434 · cos ·T5. (2.22)

 Other terms could be obtained, Plana points out, by using other arguments; for instance
 (2n'f+const.) and (3n't - 2nt + const.), or (3n'i+const.) and (2n't - 2nt + const.).

 "But one would have a numerical result much smaller than the preceding; thus we can

 dispense with carrying out this difficult calculation." Adding together his two results,
 he obtains:

 δζ = -1".9200 · sin ·Γ5 + 5"5575 · cos T5. (2.23)

 Such, he concludes, is the effect of the square of the perturbing force on the great
 inequality of Jupiter.68 The first coefficient of (2.23) differs from Laplace's by
 -3".4903, and the second by +23".6285.

 Finally, Plana undertakes to compute the second-order perturbation of Saturn (δζ')

 corresponding to (2.23), without relying on (2.13) as Laplace had done in computing δ ζ

 from δ ζ'.69 Equation (2.13), Plana says, is not uniformly correct, because the statement

 from which it is derived, m f dR + m! f d'R' = 0 (2.11), is not strictly correct: the

 expression on the left, when only terms having (5η' - 2η)1 for denominator are taken

 into account, is not equal to zero, but to a quantity of the third order with respect to m

 and m!. Plana sets about determining the detailed changes in / dR that are necessary

 to turn it into / d'R'. He finds that (2.13) is applicable to the transformation of some
 of the constituent terms, but not to all.

 The outcome of his analysis can be summarized as follows. Laplace has expanded

 R as a sequence of infinite series, the first such series being

 m!

 A(,) · cos -(i · (n't - nt + ε' - ε)),

 where i goes from —oo to + oo, and A(-,) = A(,). Others of the infinite series involve

 derivatives of A(d with respect to the mean solar distances a and a'. Laplace expands
 R' in entirely analogous series, and—with one exception—the A^ are exactly the
 same in the two expansions. Where the A(,) are the same in the two expansions,
 Laplace's (1-13) is applicable. The exception is A(1), which in the case of R, used in

 calculating the perturbations of m due to m!, is given by

 4(0 _ _f_ _ I. a(D
 A — a!1 a'

 Laplace's result had been

 Plana's two coefficients thus differ from Laplace's by +28".92016 and -55".8135.

 Laplace, now in the last year of his life (his death would come on March 5,1827),

 wrote a response intended for inclusion in the Connaissance des Tems pour l'an 1829.

 In a letter to Plana dated June 15,1826, he spoke of the volume of the C.e des Tems in

 which the memoir was to appear as being "now in press," and said that he was having

 the publisher send Plana a copy of the memoir.

 Plana received the copy in the early days of August 1826. The object of the memoir,

 he found, was to establish a modification of (2.13), namely

 3aV /d' · <$/?' = - · 3an / d ■ <5/? + (m' - m) · 3a'n'fd'R', (Z)

 m'an

 where R! is of the first order with respect to the perturbing masses, and δ R and δ R'

 are of the second order. According to Laplace, Plana's results for the second-order

 perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn [given in (2.23) and (2.25) above] fail to accord

 with the general relation (Z), so that some error must be supposed to have entered into
 Plana's calculation.73

 Plana quickly set about formulating a reply, and by early September had completed

 his "Note sur un Mémoire de M. de Laplace, ayant pour titer Sur les deux grandes

 inégalités de Jupiter et Saturne imprimé dans le volume de la C.e des Tems pour l'année

 1829." He sent several copies to Paris, for distribution to members of the Institut de

 France; later the "Note" would be published in the Memorie of the Accademia della

 Scienza of Darin, Vol. 31 (1826-1827), pp. 359-370. The gist of his reply was that

 Laplace's deduction of (Z) was based on a mistaken premise. Plana concluded that the

 relation of the two perturbations δζ and <5f' was "far from being able to be expressed

 by the very simple formula Laplace gives..." He reiterated his conviction that it was

 72 Plana's memoir, p. 405.

 73 The information in this paragraph is from Plana 1827, pp. 401-408.

 best to compute each of these perturbations directly, rather than attempting to deduce

 one from the other. He allowed that, despite all the efforts he had made to avoid error,

 his results might not be completely accurate. "But it appears to me to be demonstrated

 that the objection raised by Laplace against my coefficients does not rest on a solid
 basis..."74

 At last, apparently in late January 1827, Plana received a copy of the Connaissance

 des Terns pour l'année 1829, containing Laplace's memoir on pp. 236-244. But the text

 of the memoir, Plana now discovered, had been revised so as to eliminate the premise

 that he, Plana, had taken exception to; thus his Note, already printed for inclusion in

 the Turin Memorie, was rendered irrelevant. Laplace, following a new route, reached

 essentially the same result as before, but he now wrote it in its integrated form:

 8çl = _mVâ=.Sç + (m,_m).ç>. (Z/}

 Moreover, apparently owing to Plena's critique, he now stipulated that this relation be

 restricted to terms not having the arguments zero or 5n't - 2nt. The relation (Z'), like

 (Z), gave a result greatly differing from Plana's. "It therefore appears to me," Laplace

 concluded, "that the values of [<$£] and [<5ζ '] determined by this learned mathematician
 have need of correction."75

 Plana's response to Laplace's new derivation took the form of an "Addition," which
 he read at the meeting of the Accademia della Scienza on February 4, 1827, and
 which was published on pp. 401-408 of the same volume of the TVirin Memorie as

 that containing his earlier "Note." After remarking on Laplace's introduction of the

 new restriction in the application of (Z')—a restriction not present in the Mécanique
 Céleste—Plana continued:

 All the efforts I have made to convince myself of the justice of the old or the

 new relation-employed by M. Laplace have proved fruitless. The relative size
 of the numerical coefficients...of the neglected terms has no role in the reason
 ings by which such a relation is established, and it is to be feared that these

 factors...introduce sensible [empirically detectable] modifications. In the midst

 of my doubts I prefer the direct method that is expounded in my memoir.... I

 have preferred to carry out calculations fearsome by their length rather than

 trust purely theoretical approximations that seem to me to offer only illusory
 advantages.76

 For the determining of the square and higher powers of the perturbing force, Plana

 concluded that the general theory of perturbations was in a very imperfect state of

 development. He hoped that the difficulty of computing these perturbations might be

 mitigated by future mathematical advances, and expressed regret that, in the meantime,

 this difficulty too often deterred astronomers from a deeper study of the consequences

 hidden in the differential equations implied by universal gravitation.

 That the foregoing remarks by Plana played a role in the Berlin Academy's selec

 tion of its topic for the contest of 1830, is evident from the Academy's statement of the

 prize problem, quoted earlier. As Bouvard and Poisson reported in the Connoissance

 des Terns pour l'année 1832 (Paris 1829), the problem set by the Academy included

 "the comparison of the results of the Mécanique céleste [for the second-order per

 turbations of the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn] with those that M. Plana has

 published."77

 Plana's "Addition" presumably reached Paris only after Laplace's death. In any case,

 a response came, not from Laplace, but from Siméon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840). In a

 Mémoire sur plusieurs points de la Mécanique céleste, published in the Connaissance

 des Terns pour l'année 1831 (Paris, 1828, pp. 23-48), Poisson proposed to clarify, "as

 much as I can, the difficulties and doubts that several results in the Mécanique céleste

 have presented to the estimable mathematician [Plana]."

 The problem of the second-order perturbations contributing to the great inequality

 of Jupiter and Saturn is dealt with on pp. 40-48 of Poisson's memoir. As I explained

 in connection with equation (2.17) above, these terms arise from a product of two

 factors, one a partial derivative of R or R' with respect to a variable and the other a

 perturbation (indicated by the operator <5) of this same variable. Let μί be the argument

 of the sine or cosine contained in one of these factors, and p!t be the argument of the

 sine or cosine contained in the other. If, said Poisson, we suppose that n't is always

 preceded by a -I- sign in both pt and μ'ί, then to obtain a product with the argument

 (5n' - 2n) t, we must have

 μ 4- μ' = 5n' - 2n. (2.26a)

 This statement in fact requires correction, as Poisson later recognized; in "Additions"

 to his memoir, inserted in the Connaissance des Terns pourl'annee 1832 (Paris, 1829,

 pp. 94-98),78 he pointed out that such a product could also be obtained if

 μ - μ' = 5η' — 2η (2.26b)

 Poisson lists the following combinations as being the only ones in agreement with
 (2.26a):

 These six pairings furnish twelve kinds of terms, since in each pairing, the argu

 ments can be exchanged between the factors. Plana had calculated the terms corre

 sponding to pairings (5) and (2). Poisson proposed to show that, among the terms

 neglected by Plana, one at least was of comparable size with the terms Plana had
 considered.

 Hansen's method 435

 For this purpose, he calculated terms of δζ and δζ' belonging to pairing (1). The
 term he calculated in δζ employed the argument μ in dR/dr and the argument μ'

 in <5r; the term he calculated in δζ' employed the argument μ in 3R'/dr' and the

 argument μ' in Sr'. (It should be understood that Poisson was by no means computing

 all the terms belonging to pairing (1): there are eleven more for each of δζ and δζ',

 as the reader will realize on consulting Eq. (2.17) with its six terms in the right-hand

 member, and remembering that μ and μ' can be exchanged between the factors.)
 Poisson found:

 δζ' = 0".0878 · sin(5n't - 2nt + β),
 δζ = 8".3405 · sin(5n'f — 2nt + β');

 quantities, he urged, which cannot be neglected relative to the values of δζ and δ ζ'

 found by Plana. "It is therefore to be desired that M. Plana take up his calculations

 again, and determine the complete values of 3 ζ, and 3 ζ ' corresponding to the argument

 5n't - 2nt, without omitting any part..." To be included among these perturbations

 were the perturbations of the longitude of the epoch, which form part of the mean

 longitude of each planet.

 (The necessity of including the perturbation of the epoch had been mentioned by

 Laplace in his memoir; Plana in his "Addition" had carried out the algebraic part of

 the calculation, promising to publish the numerical results later.)

 Poisson argued at length for the correctness of Laplace's formula (Z')> but suggested

 that it applied only to the sum of the second-order perturbations, not to individual

 terms entering into that sum. Its lack of agreement with Plana's results was likely due

 to Plana's omission of important terms.

 In the "Additions" that Poisson supplied to his memoir in the Connaissance des

 Terns pour i'annee 1832, he mentioned briefly the combinations of (2.26b), giving as

 their general formula

 μ = 5n' - 2n + i(n' - η), μ' =i(n' - n),

 where i can be any positive whole number, so that there is an infinite number of such

 combinations. But this infinity is not troublesome, because

 Among the inequalities that will result, the most sensible, in general, will be

 those that correspond to the least values of i, and that come, for example, from
 6n't - 3/tf and n't - nt, or from In't - 4ni and 2n't - 2nt, etc.79

 As we shall see, however, Poisson's "general formula" fails to include several

 infinities of combinations, some terms of which may need to be computed.

 Plana did not take up the challenge that Poisson had laid down. He was immersed

 in the analytic developments required for his huge three-volume work, Théorie du

 mouvement de la lune (Turin, 1832). However, the extensive calculations that Poisson

 had indicated as necessary were undertaken by a friend and former pupil of Pois
 son at the École Polytechnique, Comte Philippe-Gustave Doulcet de Pontécoulant
 (1795-1874).

 436 C. Wilson

 To resolve the questions at issue, Pontécoulant remarked, the calculation of all the

 coefficients that could contribute to the whole must be re-done from the beginning;

 for there was no a priori way of determining which terms would be sizable, and which

 could be neglected because of their smallness. But in an initial foray, limiting himself

 to the terms that Laplace and Plana had considered, Pontécoulant was able to show that

 the second-order perturbations given by both were in error. Those in the Mécanique

 Céleste were mistaken as to sign; the original numerical computation had been done

 by Bouvard, who was able to review his manuscript calculations and detect the origin

 of the mistake.80 In Plana's case, the detail of the computations had been published;

 Pontécoulant identified the places where Plana had gone astray, and Plana accepted

 his corrections. In a memoir read to the Académie des Sciences on February 16,1829,

 Pontécoulant thus could assert that, for the particular terms considered, his own and

 Plana's computations, as well as those of the Mécanique Céleste, had been brought

 into agreement and that they agreed approximately as well with Laplace's relation

 (Z')> which was thus verified a posteriori.

 These particulars were first published in summary form in the Connaissance des

 Terns pour l'année 1833 (Paris, 1830), Additions, pp. 86-104. Earlier, in May 1829

 and February 1830, Pontécoulant had submitted to the Berlin Academy the two parts

 of an account of what he believed to be all the sizable second-order perturbations

 having the argument 5n't - 2nt, and as previously reported, for this he was awarded a

 prize in the Academy's 1830 contest.81 His final account of this inequality appeared in

 1835 as a 122-page memoir in Volume 6 of the collection called (for brevity) Savans

 étrangers.82

 Here he examined in detail the cases Poisson had listed as falling under equation

 (2.26a) above. Poisson had indicated only one case as falling under equation (2.26b);

 Pontécoulant added three more, yielding four in all:

 (1) μ = 5n' - 2n + i(n' - n) and μ' = i(n' - n),
 (2) μ = 5n' - 3n + i(n' - n) and μ' = i{n' - ή) - η,
 (3) μ = 5η' — 4n + i(n' — n) and μ' = i(n' - n) - 2n,
 (4) μ = 5n' - 5n + i(n' - n) and μ' = i(n' - n) - 3n.

 Of these types Pontécoulant calculated the terms depending on two combinations of

 type (1), namely In't — 4nt with In't — 2nt, and 6n't — 3nt with n't - nt, and one

 combination of type (2), namely In't - 5nt with 2n't - 3nt. In these three cases, he

 obtained the following paired results:

 Of the pair (2.27), Pontécoulant remarked that "they have a sizable value, although no
 mathematician till now has undertaken to determine them, and their existence seems

 to have escaped even Laplace's inquiring mind."83 In (2.27M2.29), Pontécoulant
 used relation (2.13) to deduce δζ from δζ' this relation being valid when A(1) and

 its derivatives are absent from the expansions of R and R'.M Other combinations of

 arguments failing under (2.26b), he opined, would be much smaller; but he allowed

 that some of them might be significant. Adding together all the perturbations of types
 (2.26a) and (2.26b) he had calculated, he obtained

 δζ = +3".76027 · sin T5 + 14".72268 ■ cos T5
 δζ' = +10".72775 · sin T5 - 32".58055 · cos T5

 To these perturbations must be added those of the epochs of the two planets, depending

 on the same argument. Pontécoulant found these to be

 δε' = -9".82477 · sin T5 - 1".02670 · cos T5

 Pontécoulant gives a new proof of Laplace's relation (Z'), at the same time pointing

 out its limitations. It applies to the results given by (2.30), provided that the particular

 values of if and δζ' computed for the combination of the argument 5 n't - 2 nt with the

 argument 0 (yielding a constant term) are first subtracted. The paired values of δζ and

 δζ' in agreement with (2.13) cancel out in (Z'), so that the only way of determining
 whether all the sizable perturbations in agreement with this relation have been com

 puted is by direct calculation, term by term. Both (2.13) and (Z') are useful relations,

 (2.13) obviating the detailed computation of one of the terms of any pair to which it

 applies, and (Z') making possible a check on the calculation of all the terms to which

 (2.13) does not apply, with the exception of the terms deriving from the pairing of the

 argument 5n't - 2nt with the argument 0.

 The entire discussion of second-order perturbations summarized in this section had

 for its starting point the idea that perturbations proportional to a sine or cosine with the

 argument 5n't - 2nt, and having a coefficient with the denominator (5n! - 2n)2, were

 likely to be sizable. Might not some second-order perturbations with other arguments

 be of comparable size? Addressing this question term by term would be an infinite

 This issue assumed increasing importance as the nineteenth century progressed. The

 refinement in the theoretical derivation was driven by improvements in observational

 precision. These resulted from new instruments and techniques: Fraunhofer's achro

 matic objectives, and the large heliometer he produced for the Kônigsberg Observatory;

 more accurately machined telescope mountings; more accurately calibrated circles;

 Bessel's discovery of and accounting for the observer's "personal equation," and later

 the kymograph for registering transits; the method of least squares for summarizing

 observational results, and so on. Observational astronomy was approaching an accu

 racy of thousands of a sexagesimal arcsecond. The mathematical astronomers must

 achieve a like precision in their predictions. How to proceed?

 3 Hansen's Disquisitiones

 3.1 Introductory

 The first two sections of Hansen's treatise review the current state, in 1829, of the

 theory of perturbations. The following excerpt helps us to understand the context and

 motive of Hansen's project:

 The illustrious La Place in his Mécanique Céleste gives finite expressions for the

 perturbations of the first order [with respect to the masses] of the true longitude,

 radius vector, and latitude; of these, the latter two involve the perturbing forces,

 while the first requires the radii vectores to be calculated.... [He] distributed

 [these] perturbations...in certain orders with respect to the eccentricities and

 inclinations, and determined those that are independent of these quantities, and

 those containing the first powers, accurately. The formulas for the second-order

 perturbations with respect to the eccentricities and inclinations presuppose the

 computation of the first order perturbations. He computes only a few terms

 of the third order, and those by peculiar methods. To obtain the perturbations

 of the second order with respect to the masses he makes use of the theory of

 the variation of arbitrary constants, but because of the huge number of terms

 neglected or truncated, it appears that here he succeeded less well....

 What the astronomer requires are true values of the polar coordinates of the

 celestial bodies. The primary business [of the celestial mechanician] is to derive

 the perturbations in such a way that they can be computed with the least labor. For

 this reason the method of variation of arbitrary constants is esteemed less than

 those methods by which the perturbations of the coordinates are immediately

 computed....85

 In brief, Laplace's finite expressions for the coordinates of the celestial bodies

 supply systematic results only for perturbations of the first-order with respect to the

 perturbing forces. Where perturbations of higher order must be taken into account,

 Hansen's method 439

 Laplace invoked the method of variation of arbitrary constants; but this is more labo

 rious and in other ways less convenient. This method was developed to its highest

 point by Lagrange, who gave the time rates of change of the six orbital elements of

 a celestial body as functions of the elements and of the derivatives of the perturbing

 function with respect to the elements. The perturbations of the coordinates could then

 be obtained from the perturbations of the orbital elements with the help of Taylor's

 theorem. But the coordinates being only three, the method at the outset requires the

 computation of double that number of quantities. And a deeper difficulty then emerges;

 for the perturbations of the orbital elements are larger than those of the coordinates, so

 that smaller quantities have to be determined from the differences of larger ones—a

 treacherous undertaking. "[A] perfect calculation of the perturbations of the second

 order and higher orders with respect to the masses requires an industry and patience

 not small, since each term consists of many parts, of which the larger, even when there

 is no suspicion of this, may often be hidden."86

 3.2 Preliminaries

 In seeking to develop a new method, Hansen starts from six Lagrangian—type for
 mulas for the time rates of change of the orbital elements.87 These formulas, when

 integrated, would give the orbital elements of the perturbed orbit in terms of the time

 together with certain constants that represent the orbital elements of an unperturbed

 ellipse. In practice, the constants would be evaluated by means of observations, and

 the Lagrangian formulas, when integrated, would yield the elements with a first-order

 correction for perturbations. Higher-order corrections could then be obtained by suc

 cessive approximations. As Hansen points out, however, the Lagrangian-style formulas

 can be transformed so as to yield, not the orbital elements, but any functions of the

 orbital elements and the time, and among such functions are the coordinates of the

 perturbed body, for instance, the longitude and the radius vector in the orbital plane.
 Hansen appears to be the first to attempt to capitalize on this possibility. The desir

 able thing, he observes, would be formulas similar to those provided by Kepler's laws

 for a single planet orbiting about the Sun, where the longitude and radius vector are
 ultimately dependent only on the mean anomaly (see Eqs. 2.1a, 2.1b, 2.1c above).

 To proceed in this direction, Hansen takes as his starting point the following

 stipulations.

 Let x, y, ζ be orthogonal coordinates of the perturbed body m, having their origin

 in the center of gravity of the primary body, and directed arbitrarily in space. Further,
 let

 a = the semi-major axis of the orbit of m in astronomical units;

 η = the mean motion of m in fractions of a circle per year;

 86 Ibid., col. 421.

 87 The equations Hansen starts from are derived from those given by Lagrange in his "Mémoire sur la
 théorie des variations des éléments des planètes...," read on 22 August 1808 at the Institut de France, and

 first published in Mémoires de la première classe de l'Institut de France, année 1808. See Lagrange ( 1873),
 pp. 713-768, where the formulas cited by Hansen are given on p. 760.

 The disturbing function Ω is a function of the true longitudes of the perturbed and the

 perturbing planets, their radii vectores, the mutual inclination of their orbital planes,

 and the position of the nodal line in which their planes intersect. As Hansen will

 explain later, this function is to be expanded as a series of sinusoidal terms having the

 mean anomalies of m and m! for arguments. The partial derivatives of Ω will also be

 expressible as series in terms of the mean anomalies, and hence of the time.

 With these definitions, the Lagrangian-style equations with which Hansen begins

 Hansen's method 441

 I have separated the six equations into two groups. The equations in (3.1a) give the time

 rates of change of (In a), e, ε, m, the elements most directly involved in determining

 the motion of m in the instantaneous orbital plane. The equations in (3.1b) give the

 time rates of change of θ and i, the elements most directly involved in determining

 the position of the instantaneous plane. The two groups are not strictly separable; for

 instance, both de/dt and dm/dt involve the inclination i. Hansen focuses initially on

 the motion in the instantaneous plane, and in the first approximation ignores the terms

 in de/dt and dm/dt that depend on i.

 3.3 Longitude and radius vector in the instantaneous orbital plane

 Hansen now introduces two functions λ and ρ of the elements a, e, ε, m, and an

 initially indeterminate quantity τ. In λ, the elements a, e, ε, and m are to be conjoined

 with τ in precisely the same way as, in the true longitude ν of a constant elliptical

 orbit, they are conjoined with the time, t. Thus,

 nr + ε - m = Ε - e sin Ε,

 λ -m Ι l + e Ε (3-2)

 = VT^m2·

 where Ε is the eccentric anomaly [compare equations (2.1a), (2.1b)]. The variable λ

 can be expanded in a series as a function of the quantity ητ + ε-m, which becomes

 the mean anomaly when r is changed into t. (For the comparable expansion of v, see

 equation [2.4].) As for p, the elements a, e, ε, and nr are to be conjoined with τ in

 the same way as, in the radius vector r of the fixed elliptical orbit, they are conjoined
 with the time, t. Thus,

 a (l — e2)

 P = l + e cos (λ — m) (3'3)

 where ρ is related to τ through λ, as determined in (3.2), and can be expanded in a

 series analogous to the series for r given in (2.3).

 The relations just mentioned determine how λ and ρ are algebraically related to τ,
 but meanwhile the orbital elements can undergo change in accordance with (3.1a) and

 (3.1b). By the rules of partial differentiation, the variations of λ and ρ caused by the
 variations of the elements are

 Each term on the right-hand side of (3.4 or (3.5) is composed of two factors, the first

 a derivative of λ or In ρ written with curly deltas and the second a time rate of change

 of an orbital element as given by (3.1a). The derivatives written with curly deltas are

 partial derivatives: the differentiation is with respect to a designated variable in λ or

 In p, every other variable being held constant. (Hansen sometimes uses parentheses

 enclosing a derivative to indicate that the differentiation is partial; but he does not

 always give parentheses this signification.) The derivatives άλ/àt and (d In p)/df in

 (3.4) and (3.5) give the variations of λ and (In p) with t only insofar as the elements

 a, e, ε, and m vary with t. In the integration of (3.4) and (3.5) with respect to t,

 arbitrary constants must be added. In the integration of (3.4), Hansen adds as arbitrary

 constant the true longitude in a constant elliptical orbit, with elements determined

 observationally for the epoch. After integration, substituting the variable t for the

 quantity r, we obtain an expression for λ incorporating both sorts of variation with

 time that λ undergoes, the variation caused by the variation of the elements, and the

 variation caused by the motion of m on its varying orbit.

 Hansen has yet to introduce his key idea: the construal of λ as a function of a single

 variable ζ such that, when ζ is substituted for τ in (3.2), we obtain the true perturbed

 value of λ. Evidently ζ must be a function of both t and τ, and be equal to τ when t = 0

 (that is, at the epoch); moreover, its determination must incorporate the integration of

 (3.4) already described. If we view λ as a function of the single variable ζ, its variation

 with t will be given by

 Here dX /dt is to be understood as the variation arising solely from the variation of the

 orbital elements, as given in (3.4); hence, the expressions for άλ/dt in (3.4) and (3.6)

 constant to be added to (3.8) when integrated will also be τ. If after integration we

 Here 3λ/3τ is a partial derivative determined by the relation between λ and τ defined

 by the equation (3.2); but what about dζ/dτΊ As yet, we have no formula for ζ that

 could be differentiated partially with respect to r ; as we shall see, Hansen will develop

 such a formula through successive approximations, giving 3f/3r the value 1 if no

 perturbations have as yet occurred, and allowing it to diverge from 1 as perturbations

 occur. Using the foregoing relation to eliminate dλ/dζ, from (3.7), Hansen obtains

 Hansen's method 443

 change τ into f, we shall have a function, which, substituted for f in the purely elliptical

 expression for v, gives the perturbed value of v. This function—the integral of (3.8)

 with τ changed into f—will be designated by the letter z

 Turning to the integration of (3.5), Hansen proposes to calculate the arbitrary con

 stant, to be added after integration, from the purely elliptical formulas with ζ in place of

 f, or in effect, with the true perturbed longitude. But the value of ζ has been determined

 so as to give, in the primordial ellipse—the ellipse with orbital elements determined at

 epoch—the true perturbed value of λ, not the true perturbed value of (In p). An error
 is thus introduced.

 To correct for it, Hansen subtracts the quantity 3 i," ^ from the right-hand side

 of (3.5), so that the integral of that side is reduced by / 3 ^ p$dt. Now (In p),
 Hansen points out, contains τ in two ways, implicitly through ζ, and also through its
 dependence (3.3) on λ and so on (3.2) (Hansen speaks of the latter dependence as
 explicit.) He lets In (p) designate the part of (In p) that contains r in the latter more

 explicit way, and so finds

 In afurther transformation, Hansen makes a number of substitutions in (3.8) and (3.10),

 using relations among the partial differentials of the longitude and radius vector in an

 elliptical orbit. They are derivable from the series exhibiting ν and r as functions of

 the mean anomaly. Thus, let ν be represented by

 v = nt + ε + f(nt + ε — m). (Compare equation (2.4).)

 Then, supposing this ellipse to become variable, and remembering that η and a, whether
 they vary or not, are always related by the equation aV « 1, so that dn/da =

 -3n/2a, we find the derivatives of ν with respect to t, a, ε, and m to be

 By eliminating f'(nt+ε - m) between the first and the other three of these equations,

 and substituting -(3/2)a~5/2 for dn/da, we obtain formulas for dv/da, dv/dE, and

 dv/dzun in terms of dv/dt, and an entirely analogous set of formulas applies to λ

 In a similar way, we can represent (In r) by

 In r = In α + In [1 + F (nt + ε - m)]. [Compare equation (2.3).]

 Taking the partial derivatives of this expression with respect to t, α, ε, and στ,then

 eliminating F'(nt+ε-τσ)/[ 1 + F(nt +E-m)] between the first and each of the other

 three of the resulting equations, we obtain expressions for (9 In r) /da, (9 in r) /9ε,

 (3.12)

 In the left-hand member of (3.12), I have followed Hansen in changing the "d's"

 in d£/df (as this derivative appears in 2.8) into curly deltas; What does the change

 signify? As yet we have no algebraic formula for ζ, and indeed, we shall find it to

 be determinable only by successive approximations. Presumably Βζ/dt means the

 variation of ζ with t, that is solely due to the variation of the orbital elements, the

 dependence of ζ on t through r having been set aside. In (3.8), df/df means exactly

 the same thing before integration, but in the integration, with the change of r to t, we

 would obtain f's total dependence on t, both through the variation of the elements

 and through r. The use of curly deltas in (3.12) signifies that ζ prior to integration is

 simultaneously a function of t and r.

 Equations (3.12) and (3.13), being functions of t and r, can be differentiated with

 respect to either of these variables, provided that all the quantities varying with each

 are simultaneously treated as variable. In differentiations with respect to t, all the

 orbital elements must be supposed variable. In differentiations with respect to τ, the

 quantities λ and ρ must be supposed variable.

 Hansen proceeds to differentiate (3.12) with respect to τ, obtaining

 (f/l)
 3 din a 5757 37 ~ à? 37 de dm
 dr 2 df [jjij2 df [jttj2 df '

 When (3.14) is integrated with respect to r, the arbitrary constant to be added will be a

 function of τ so determined that, when r is changed into t, the whole integral vanishes.

 This is necessary because, before the orbital elements have undergone change, that is,

 before integration with respect to t, dζ/^τ = 1, but Βζ/dt = 0, so that the bracketed

 expression on the left of (3.14) is equal to zero. After integration with respect to f,

 8ζ/dt is no longer equal to zero; only then, normally, is r changed into t.

 In the further development, it is the integration of (3.14) and (3.13) that Hansen

 will be concerned with. We observe that ζ occurs in (3.13) only in the form of the

 ratio obtained by integrating (3.14) with respect to τ.

 Once (3.14) is integrated with respect to r, the way of obtaining d ζ /3τ by successive

 approximations becomes discernible. In the first approximation, we can put δζ/3r =

 1; we thus obtain an expression for dç/dt that can be integrated with respect to t

 to give an expression—the first approximation—for ζ. Hie latter expression can be

 differentiated partially with respect to r to give an improved value of 9 ζ/d r. This value

 can be used in the second approximation, whence improved values of 3f/dt and so of

 ζ, and dζ/dτ will be obtained, and so on. The successive values of dζ/dτ will have

 the form: 1 + terms multiplied by the mass of the perturbing planet. This is so because

 the added terms are proportional to the time rates of change of orbital elements, and

 these are linearly dependent on partial derivatives of Ω, and Ω is proportional to the

 mass of the perturbing planet.

 In further preparation of (3.14) and (3.13) for integration, Hansen takes the follow

 ing steps. First, in the expressions for the time rates of change of the orbital elements

 (3.1a), the partial derivatives of Ω with respect to a, e, e, and m are replaced by partial

 derivatives of Ω with respect to ν and r, in accordance with the formulas

 Hansen's basic idea is to express Ω as a function of the longitudes, radii vectores, incli

 nations, and nodes; here, however, he neglects the dependence of 3Ω/3ε and 3Ω/3πτ

 on the inclination i—a neglect he proposes to redress in the second approximation.

 Next, he makes substitutions for the derivatives of ν and (In r) with respect to

 t and e, and for the analogous derivatives of λ and (In p) with respect to r and e.

 The equivalences employed are derivable from the elementary formulas for elliptical
 motion (as enumerated, for instance, in Gauss's Theoria Motus88).

 An analogous statement applies to (L')·

 ation of (H ') and (J') with respect to τ, followed by substitution of the value of dp/dr

 In the Disquisitiones, Hansen does not undertake to integrate these equations, but

 indicates how it may be done. The disturbing function Ω must first be developed
 as a series in terms of the sines and cosines of the multiples of the mean anom

 alies nt + ε - m and n't + ε' — m' of the perturbed and perturbing planets. In the

 first approximation, a, n, e, ε, and m, and the corresponding orbital elements of m!

 are given their unperturbed elliptical values. In the integral of (3.16) with respect to

 τ, 8ζ/8τ is set equal to 1, and the resulting equation is integrated with respect to t
 to give an expression for ζ, and therewith, numbers being substituted for the con

 stants, a value for z. Given ζ and hence nz, the corresponding values of λ and (In p)

 can be calculated; the latter, we recall, is the arbitrary constant to be added in the

 integration of (3.17). In this integration, the term ~[3 ^1{3τ]^ can be neglected
 in the first approximation, since it is of the second order; in later approximations,

 it can be calculated from the expressions for ζ and ln(p) obtained in the preceding
 approximation.

 The integration of (3.17) does not require a special calculation, because of a rela

 tion between Eqs. (3.16) and (3.17). This relation, which can be verified by a direct
 comparison of the two equations, is as follows:

 A first approximation to the perturbations of ln(p), Hansen points out, can be obtained

 if (3.18) is integrated with respect to t, with 8ζ/8τ set equal to 1, and the second term

 on the left ignored. The second term on the right of (3.18), when 8ζ/8τ is set equal
 to 1, becomes here 8ζ/8τ is to be obtained by differentiating ζ, as computed
 according to (3.16), and before the change of τ into t, with respect to r; τ is then

 changed to t. The same procedure can be used in the second and higher approximations,
 but with the difference that the second term on the left of (3.18) must be calculated;

 the fact that 9f/9t now differs from 1 must be taken into account both there and in

 the second term on the right.

 The preceding summary gives the main result of the Disquisitiones for the calcu

 lation of the longitude and radius vector in the instantaneous plane. This result, we

 emphasize, is a deductive consequence of the Lagrangian formulas, the only depar

 tures from deductive rigor being such as successive approximations will progressively

 correct for. The procedure for successive approximations is explicitly spelled out,

 leaving no room for intuitive guesses of the Laplacian kind.

 It will be noted that Eqs. (3.16) and (3.18) can be used to check each other. This

 relation and another conditional equation that we shall exhibit later enable Hansen to

 confirm his calculation of the numerical values of the perturbational terms resulting

 from his theory. As Hansen will later urge, this possibility of checking his numerical

 calculations along an independent route is a major advantage of his method as com

 pared with earlier methods. For this possibility, he informs us, he is indebted to the

 introduction of the quantity r.

 3.4 Position of the instantaneous orbital plane

 The treatment of this topic in the Disquisitiones is flawed. Hansen discovered the

 error in the course of working on his Untersuchung iiber die gegenseitigen Storung

 des Jupiters und Sat urns,99 and there introduced an appropriate revision.90 Here we

 review the valid part of the earlier treatment, which Hansen presupposes in the later

 work, and indicate where the original treatment went astray.

 The position of the orbital plane is determined by i, the inclination of that plane to

 the fixed xy plane, and θ, the position of its ascending node on the xy plane. Under

 perturbation, these orbital elements become variable, in accordance with the equa

 tions (3.1b) for di/di and άθ/àt. These time derivatives depend in turn on the partial

 derivatives of the disturbing function Ω with respect to ε and nr. In the Disquisitiones

 , Hansen seeks, in a first approximation, to express the orientation of the orbital plane

 independently of 8Ω/8ε and 9Ω/9πτ.

 He begins by introducing new variables:

 ρ = sin i ■ sin Θ, q = sin i ■ cos θ (3.19)

 (A similar change of variables had first been introduced by Lagrange in 1774;91 but

 Lagrange had used tan i rather than sin i in the expressions for ρ and q. Laplace

 followed Lagrange in this respect.) For the perturbing planet m', the corresponding

 variables p', q' are defined analogously. From equations (3.1b) and the rules of dif
 ferentiation, it follows that

 The position of the xy plane at the epoch is a matter of arbitrary choice. Hansen

 proposes to choose it so that it coincides initially with the orbital plane of the perturbed

 planet. Then i = 0, whence ρ = q — 0, and equations (3.20) reduce to

 dp an 3Ω dq an 3Ω
 df Vl - e2 3q ' df Vl - e2 dp

 (3.21)

 Equations of this form, Hansen asserts, can always be applied: since the quantity Ω is

 independent of the position of the plane to which the coordinates are referred, we are

 free to choose this plane at any stage of our computations so as to render evanescent

 the variables p, q of the planet under investigation. The advantage is a reduction in

 computational labor.

 If planet m is perturbed by planet m!, the perturbations of the orbital plane of m

 will be most directly determined by reference to the mutual inclination I (capital I) of

 the orbital planes of m and m', and the ascending node Θ of the orbital plane of m'

 on the orbital plane of m; when by choice of the initial conditions i is made equal to
 zero, i' -> 1 and Θ' -*■ Θ. Let Ρ = sin / sin Θ, Q — sin / cos Θ.

 To determine P, Q in a general way in terms of p, q and p', q', we revert to an

 arbitrary orientation of the xy plane. Consider the spherical triangle formed on the unit

 sphere by the xy plane and the orbital planes of m and m'. The side of this triangle

 measured in the xy plane will be θ' - Θ, and the opposite angle will be I; the side
 measured in the orbital plane of m will be Θ - θ, and the opposite angle will be
 180° — the third angle will be i. Then, by spherical trigonometry, we shall have

 sin I sin(© - Θ) — sin i' sin(0' - θ);

 sin I cos(0 - Θ) = sin i' cos i cos(0' - Θ) - cos i' sin i.

 Substituting from the definitions of P, Q, p, q, p', q' into (3.22), we obtain the two

 equations

 Pq — Qp — pq ~q p<

 I „ „ I (3.23)

 Pp+Qq = (p'p + q'q)yj ι - p2 - q2- (p2+q 1 - Pa - q'2,

 and from (3.23), we can deduce that

 Next, Hansen sets about finding values for 3Ω/3ρ and 3Ω/3q in (3.21) in terms of

 3Ω/3Ρ and 3Ω/3 Q, taking the orbital plane of the perturbed planet to be identical
 with the xy plane at the epoch, so that at that time ρ = q = 0. It is here in the

 Disquisitiones that his error occurs. When ρ and q change, so that i and θ change, the

 change in the longitude of the ascending node causes a change in v, the true longitude,

 and 3Ω/3ρ and 3Ω/3# therefore prove to be functions not only of i and Θ, but of ν as

 well. Hansen in the Disquisitiones, assuming that dp/dt and dq/dt are independent

 of v, obtains

 dp an 3Ω
 -d/ = ~sn^c0s SQ'
 dq an 3Ω l''
 ¥ = -vr^C0S/^

 but these results are incomplete, as we shall later see.

 Since equations (3.24) express only the spherical trigonometry embodied in equa

 tions (3.22), they can be used to find the P, Q pair expressing the inclination and

 node relating any two intersecting planes, if the pairs p, q and ρ', q' for these planes,

 relating them to some third plane, are known. Suppose, for instance, that the p, q pah

 relates the orbital plane of the perturbed planet to the plane of the ecliptic, considered as

 fixed at a chosen epoch of time. Suppose further that the pair \p\, [q\ relates the orbital

 plane of the Earth (the mobile ecliptic, which moves because the Earth's motions are

 subject to perturbation) to the same fixed ecliptic. Then in (3.24), substituting [p] for

 p' and [q] for q', we shall obtain in the pair P, Q the relation of the orbital plane of the

 perturbed planet to the mobile ecliptic—the plane to which astronomers customarily

 refer the motions of the planets.

 The preceding Sects. 3.3 and 3.4 have introduced the main formulas of Hansen's

 method as developed in the Disquisitiones. In this work, Hansen also describes how,

 by means of numerical integration, Ω can be expanded as a series in terms of the

 mean anomalies g and g', and he deduces special conditional equations that enable
 him to check the correctness of the massive calculations that his method entails. I shall

 describe these features of Hansen's method in the course of explaining how they are

 applied in the Untersuchung, to which I now turn.

 4 Hansen's Untersuchung: first-order perturbations

 The Untersuchung is a treatise of 318 pages, pp. 193-315 being occupied by some

 47 tables, which are altogether unintelligible without the preceding mathematical
 derivations and explanatory digressions. Hansen's mathematical explanations can

 seem obscure. My account of the Untersuchung will seek to elucidate the logical

 structure of the central argument.

 Hansen's method 451

 4.1 Vorwort

 In a foreword, Hansen acknowledges that his solution of the problem posed by the

 Berlin Academy is not yet complete. The greater and more arduous part of the work,

 he states, has been accomplished: the calculation of the first-, second-, and third-order

 perturbations of Saturn due to Jupiter, except for a few small terms of the third order,

 and the calculation of the first-order perturbations of Jupiter due to Saturn. Unwilling to

 forego entering the contest as the deadline arrives, Hansen submits his nearly finished

 essay, promising to carry out the remaining calculations forthwith.

 In a Nachschrift at the end of the Untersuchung, Hansen tells us that the Berlin

 Academy, at his request, has granted him additional time to prepare his prize essay

 for publication. In the interval, he has completed the calculation of the second-order

 perturbations of Jupiter, and with their help has carried out a check on the accuracy

 of the second-order perturbations of Saturn. The printed work, however, does not

 contain the perturbations of Jupiter beyond those of the first order. Rather, it gives tables

 for the perturbations of Saturn in longitude, radius vector, and latitude, including all

 of the third-order terms except certain ones which Hansen characterizes as "few" and

 "small," and which would require the prior computation of the third-order perturbations

 of Jupiter.

 Hill later raised the question why Hansen failed to continue his work on Jupiter

 and Saturn to the point of preparing new tables for Jupiter and Saturn. Was Hansen,

 as Hill suggested, "carried away with the ambition of applying his peculiar method of

 treatment to the lunar theory"?92 Hill's remark seems to imply that Hansen's decision

 not to develop the theory of Jupiter and Saturn to the point of providing new tables

 was unprofessional. Let us recall, however, that already in 1828, Hansen had arrived
 at the hypothesis that Uranus was perturbed by some as yet undiscovered planet(s)

 farther from the Sun and that a complete theory of Jupiter and Saturn would have
 required an account of their perturbations due to Uranus. In the letters of Hansen to
 Encke93—Encke was in charge of the Berliner Jahrbuch, in which the annual lunar

 and planetary ephemerides of the Berlin Academy were published—I have found

 no indication that the Berlin Academy encouraged Hansen to prepare new tables

 of Jupiter and Saturn. The Untersuchung was primarily regarded, it appears, as a
 demonstration of a new and controversial method, which Hansen was called on to

 defend. Accurate tables of Jupiter and Saturn had less urgency than an accurate lunar

 theory.

 To return to Hansen's Vorwort: the chief innovation of his new method, Hansen

 explains, is to compute the perturbations of the mean longitude rather than those of

 the true longitude. The advantage is in efficiency and accuracy. Thus, to obtain a

 92 Hill (1890,1906), p. 13.

 93 The Berlin-Brandenburgische Académie der Wissenschaften possesses in its archive a collection of some

 76 letters from Hansen to Encke. The corresponding letters of Encke to Hansen do not appear to be extant.

 precision of 0". 1 in the first-order perturbations, Hansen has found that, by the old

 procedure, he must compute 49 terms in the case of Saturn, and 54 in the case of

 Jupiter; the corresponding numbers in the new procedure are 38 and 43. The reason

 is the more rapid convergence of the infinite series giving perturbations of the mean

 longitude, as compared with the series giving perturbations of the true longitude.

 The terms neglected below a given lower bound form a smaller sum; "hence the

 totality of the perturbations...is obtained more exactly by my method than by the old
 method."94

 452 C. Wilson

 The only existing alternative to Hansen's new method for the systematic devel

 opment of higher-order perturbations was to employ the Lagrangian formulas for the

 perturbations of the orbital elements. But, Hansen argues, this alternative leads to much

 less convergent series. When used for obtaining the perturbations of the longitude and

 radius vector, the Lagrangian formulas regularly require determination of higher-order

 terms from differences of lower-order terms, with consequent uncertainty in the results.

 Moreover, the labor involved is far greater. Hansen finds that for the second-order per

 turbations, the Lagrangian method requires the computation of 78 products, while his

 new method requires the computation of only 25. Finally, the Lagrangian method pro

 vides no controls for checking the correctness of the calculations; Hansen's method

 explicitly provides such controls.

 The Berlin Academy of Sciences, in setting the prize problem, had required an

 explanation of the difference between Laplace's and Plana's results for the higher

 order perturbations having the argument (5g' - 2g). As we have seen, Poisson and

 Pontécoulant listed 12 different relations whence sizable terms of this kind might arise,

 but dismissed some of these and an infinity of other relations as leading to negligible

 contributions. According to Hansen, however, the number of such relations can be

 properly limited only by setting a lower bound to the absolute numerical magnitude

 of the terms considered. He has carried the calculation further than anyone earlier and
 shown that the sources of sizable contributions cannot be reduced to the 12 relations

 designated by Poisson and Pontécoulant. On the other hand, Plana and Pontécoulant

 have adequately explained the cause of the differences between Laplace's and Plana's

 results, and Hansen therefore passes this question over.

 4.2 First-order perturbations of the longitude: "Bessel functions" introduced

 into the Untersuchung

 Equation (3.16) of Sect. 3.3, we recall, is Hansen's basic equation for perturbations

 of the longitude; it is applicable to perturbations of all orders with respect to the

 perturbing force. Its integral yields a value of f; in turn, ξ, becomes ζ when r, in all

 its occurrences in the integral, is changed into t. (As this is done, λ -*■ υ and ρ -*■ r.)

 The true perturbed value of the longitude is then obtained by substituting ζ in place of

 t in the Keplerian formula for the purely elliptical longitude.

 In the first nine sections of the Untersuchung (pp. 3-37), Hansen develops a mod

 ified form of (3.16), applicable only to first-order perturbations. He was led to this

 modification by Bessel's "Untersuchung des Theils der planetarischen Storungen,

 welcher aus der Bewegung der Sonne entsteht," published in 1826.95 In this memoir,

 Bessel employed series for derivatives of (r2/a2) in the expansion of the part of the
 disturbing function that Hansen labels Ω2 (see Sect. 4.5); Bessel was here introduc

 ing "Bessel functions"—misleadingly so called, since Bessel was not the first to use

 them. The advantage for Hansen was the obtaining of more rapidly converging series.

 Hansen applies these series to the elaboration of the coefficients which, in Hansen's

 differential equations, multiply the partial derivatives of Ω.

 Hansen's method 453

 In a further transformation, Hansen introduces the mean anomaly g = nt + ε - π

 into the coefficient of 9Ω/9ε by differentiating this coefficient with respect to g, then

 integrating with respect to g. Equation (4.1a) thus becomes

 Here, the coefficient of 9Ω/9« has been so configured that the constant of integration

 of the integral there occurring is zero. This equation, says Hansen

 has the advantage over all known formulas, that it does not require the coefficients

 in the series expansion of the equation of center, but only the coefficients for the

 expansion of the square of the radius vector, and it leads therefore to much more

 rapidly converging series...96

 will yield [§£/§£·]; or rather, since Hansen in the first approximation sets 9£/9r = 1,
 it will give9f/9f.

 Now τ is not present in Ω or its derivatives; hence, the integration will affect

 only the coefficients of 9Ω/9δ and of γ(9Ω/9γ), and in these coefficients, τ appears
 only in y = ητ + ε — π. For terms in which neither κ nor k is zero, let us set

 The next step is to obtain ζ, by integrating (4.2a). This requires that Ω be expanded

 as a series in terms of the mean anomalies of the perturbed and perturbing planets.

 The last four terms on the right arise from the last two terms of (4.2b) through integra

 tion by parts. The rule for this operation is / PdQ = PQ-J Qdp, where Ρ and Q are
 two functions. Thus, in the first of the two terms of (4.2b) containing the coefficient
 Co,o,we may set Ρ = (nr - nt), so that dΡ = -n\dQ is then cos(ig + i'g'), so that

 Q will be ) (since g = nt + ε - π ,and g' = n't + ε' - π'). On calculating

 PQ- J Qdp, we obtain the third and the second of the four resulting terms of (4.3).

 In an entirely similar way, the fourth and first of the last four terms in (4.3) arise from

 the last term of (4.2b).

 How to understand the first term on the right of (4.3), namely n(l - c)r? As Hansen
 explains, the integration leading to (4.3) ceases to be correct when i = i' = 0. To

 obtain the terms arising in that case, we must return to (4.2b), set i = i' = 0, and

 integrate; the result is

 This multitude of terms must therefore be added to (4.3). Among the terms to be added

 are those in which, not only i = i' = 0, but also κ = 0:

 — {(-*) (-k, 0; c) Co,k + [-k, 0; c] Dok} nt.
 μ r

 C = X {(-k) (-*, 0; c) Co,k + [-*, 0; c] D0,k}. (4.5)

 458 C. Wilson

 This term unites with the mean motion of the planet; or rather, it causes the mean

 motion as determined by astronomical observations to differ from the mean motion

 that would obtain in the absence of perturbation. Hansen gives to the coefficient of

 this term the symbol c:

 CL171 % t r λ

 ^ k

 Adding cnt to (4.3), he thus obtains

 ηζ = ητ - c (ητ — nt) + periodic perturbations,

 and when τ -* t, it follows that

 nz — nt+ periodic perturbations,

 where η is to be understood as the mean motion obtained from observations.98

 Hansen's theory for the longitude implies an infinity of perturbational terms. How

 does he choose for calculation the terms that will be sizable enough to matter?

 He is aiming to achieve an accuracy of 0".03 or 0".04;" but he sets the precision in

 individual calculations at 0" .001. Assume the expansion of Ω to have been carried out

 far enough so as to include all terms with coefficients greater than or equal to 0".001.

 For illustration, Hansen explains the steps involved in computing the coefficient of

 the term in nz that is multiplied by sin(3g + 2g'). In (4.3), where r has not yet been

 changed to t, the contributions to this coefficient come from the second line, where

 the part we have to be concerned about is

 {(i - k)(i - hi'; c)CK}k + U ~ k, i'\ c]DKik} sin (κγ + ig + i'g').

 Here i' = 2 throughout our computation, but the integer multiplying g when τ —► t

 and consequently γ -+ g results from the sum κ+i. Thus, all the following arguments

 of the sine function in (4.3) lead to the same final argument 3g + 2g':

 0y + 3g + 2g', -y + 4g + 2g, -2γ + 5g + 2g , etc.

 y +2g + 2g', 2y + g + 2g', etc.

 98 The question as to how the mean motion is influenced by perturbation had been raised by Plana. See
 Plana 1826.

 99 As he states at Untersuchung, p. 69.

 Hansen's method 459

 In each of these cases, where a particular value of κ is under consideration, the various

 possible values of k must also be considered. Thus, the coefficient of the term multiplied

 by sin(-y + 4g + 2g') arises from the sum

 {4 (4,2; c) C_i,o + [4,2; c]£>_i,o}

 + {5 (5,2; c) C-ι,-ι + [5,2; c]D_i,_2}

 + {6 (6,2; c) C_i,_2 + [6,2; c] £>-1,-2}

 + etc.

 + {3(3,2; c) C_/,i + [3,2; c] D_u}

 + {2(2,2; c)C-1,2,+ [2,2; c] £>-1,2}

 The indices κ and k are thus to be varied in the positive and in the negative directions

 "until we arrive at terms that can be neglected."100

 It is evident that, in the reckoning of coefficients belonging to the argument

 (ig + pg'), the coefficients of terms in the expansion of Ω that play a role are those
 for which i' = p, and only those. The major divisions in Hansen's calculation are

 therefore determined by the choice of p. For a given choice of p, he obtains a sequence

 of arguments for the sinusoidal function that extends indefinitely in two directions,

 involving multiples of g decreasing toward -00g and increasing toward +00g:

 (-2 g + pg'),

 {-g + pg')>
 ( Pg')
 (g + Pg')>

 (2 g + pg'),

 etc.

 According to Hansen, the terms corresponding to these arguments, continued forward

 and backward from a point where the terms have maximal values, become negligi

 ble.101 This, he acknowledges, is an empirical finding, not a result provable a priori. He

 recommends determining the region of larger terms by trial and error, then continuing

 the calculation of terms in both directions. This way of judging the completeness of
 the calculation is new with Hansen.

 A very considerable alleviation of the calculational labor is brought about by the

 following analytic result, which Hansen proves.102 Let the main terms of (4.3) be

 expressed by a sum of terms of the form

 4.3 The first-order perturbations of the radius vector

 Hansen determines the first-order perturbations of the logarithm of the radius vector

 by means of the relation I have numbered (3.18). For first-order perturbations, (3.18)

 can be simplified by setting

 The equation then takes the form

 Integrating with respect to t yields

 21n(p) = 5-^. (4.8)

 dr

 Hansen here writes (ζ) in place of ζ, to indicate that the constant of integration τ,

 normally added when ζ, is integrated with respect to r, is to be omitted. The only

 constant of integration required for (4.8) is the value of (In p) computed from the

 purely elliptical formula, with ζ in place of r, as explained in Sect. 3.3.

 Next, Hansen differentiates (4.8) with respect to r, so that S, which does not contain

 r, disappears: 2^^ = -0.

 Hansen's way of indicating that he has changed τ into t in a quantity is to draw a

 bar over the quantity, for instance dljT^ = dlj^. The preceding equation, with r
 changed into t, is

 dln(r) Id5?

 dr ~ 2 dr2'

 whence in(r) = — - / j-j + Const. (4.9)

 What is the added constant in (4.9)? It is not the constant just mentioned as the only

 constant to be added to the integral (4.8). Any constant present in (4.8), we observe,

 would have been eliminated by the differentiation with respect to τ. The constant in

 (4.9), if it differs from zero, must be identical with whatever constant is present in
 the value of ln(r) derivable from (4.8). Now the value of ln(r) derivable from (4.8) is

 obtained by changing τ into f; it is

 inw=ls-ï^· (4io)

 Comparing this value of ln(r) with that given by (4.9), we find

 Neither the first term on the left nor the first term on the right can contain the constant

 in question; hence Const. = -5%^·

 But what is d(z)/dr? To understand this, we must go back to (4.2b) and integrate

 it so as to obtain η(ζ) rather than ηζ; in other words, without adding the integrative

 constant which, as we see from (4.3), turns out to be n(l - c)τ. Taking account of

 462 C. Wilson

 (4.5), we find that η(ζ) = cnt + periodic terms. Consequently, the constant part of

 ά(ζ)/άΐ = c. But (constant part of ά(ζ)/Αί) = (constant part of d(z)/df), since the

 change of r into t affects only the periodic terms on the right-hand side of (4.3). Thus
 Const. = (l/2)d(z)/di = -c/2

 Hansen introduces one further refinement. The final constant to be added to obtain

 the true value of ln(r) is the value of ln(/>) from the elliptical formula, with ηζ replacing

 the mean motion. Into that elliptical formula there enters a value of the mean solar
 distance a, or, in Hansen's formulation, (In a). The value of a to be used here is ao,

 determined from the mean motion which would obtain if perturbations were absent; as

 we have seen, this mean motion is no = «(1 - c). The two theoretical numbers, no and

 ao, are related to the observational values, η and a, by the Keplerian equation afinl =

 a3n2 = α3η$(1 - c)2. It follows that ao = a (1 - c)2^3. Since Hansen proposes to use
 (In a) in place of (In ao), he must introduce the correction (In ao) — (In a). But by the

 result just given, this is (2/3) ln(l - c). If c « 1, it may be approximated as (2/3)c.
 Therefore, with this correction, we shall have

 „ t 1 d(z) 2 1
 Const. = —h -c = -c.
 2 At 3 6

 From (4.9), it then follows that

 In(r) = ^ I ^dt + y. (4.11)

 \s

 To determine η (f) and its first and second derivatives with respect to r, we may return

 to (4.3), deleting the added constant n(l - c)r, adding the terms required by (4.4),

 and then differentiating. We observe that, with the exception of the last two terms of

 (4.3), r occurs on the right-hand sides of (4.3) and (4.4) only in γ — ητ + e — π. The
 result of the differentiations takes the form

 4.4 Two conditional equations for checking the numerical calculations of ν and ln(r)

 The determination of ln(r) by (4.11) and (4.12) is entirely independent of 3Ω/3υ.

 However, Hansen recommends checking the calculation by computing ln(r) by the
 entirely separate route of (4.10), which entails the somewhat laborious determination
 of

 Hansen's method 463

 an 3Ω

 Vl - e2 dv

 The agreement of the two calculations shows the correctness of both the expansion of

 Ω and the summations involved in the perturbation coefficients. This is one of two con

 ditional equations on which Hansen puts great store, for they permit a rigorous check

 on the correctness of the numerical calculation of ν and ln(r). In earlier perturbational

 methods, no such rigorous control was available.

 The second conditional equation, like the first, depends ultimately on Hansen's
 introduction of the quantity r.103 Since the first derivatives of the coordinates with

 respect to the time have the same form whether they are perturbed or unperturbed,

 the orbital elements where they enter into this differentiation can be supposed either

 variable or invariable. If we differentiate the perturbed coordinate ν with respect to t

 directly, we are manifestly supposing the orbital elements to be variable and hence to

 be functions of t. But if we differentiate ζ, with respect to τ, and afterward write t for

 r, the coordinate ν is differentiated as if the orbital elements were invariable, since τ

 is not present in the perturbed values of the elements. Differentiating in the first way
 yields

 while differentiating in the second way yields

 where the quantity τ that is present in the derivatives on the right is to be changed into

 t. The two foregoing equations must agree, whence

 But it is evident that, after τ is changed into f,

 103 Hansen describes this conditional equation in his Disquisitiones, Section 17, cols. 446-448. It seemed

 best to postpone our account of it till after we had arrived at Hansen's expression for a typical term of ζ, as
 in (4.3).

 where, again, following on the indicated differentiation on the left, r is to be changed

 where in the left-hand member we are to understand that, after the differentiation, r

 To illustrate the use of such equations, I shall show how (4.14) is applied. A typical

 term in ζ, when there is only one perturbing planet, is of the form (compare equation
 (4.3) above)

 a sin (ig+i'g')+fi sin [y+(t - 1) g+i'g'] + S sin [2y 4- (i - 2) g + i'g']+etc.

 4.5 The first-order perturbations of the latitude

 As stated earlier, in the Untersuchung, Hansen has come to recognize that his account

 of the latitudes in the Disquisitiones was flawed: the position of the instantaneous

 orbital plane cannot be treated independently of the longitude. In his revised treatment

 in the Untersuchung, he introduces an explicit dependence of dΩ/dp and dΩ/dq on

 Here, as in Sect. 3.4, Ρ = sin / sin Θ, Q = sin I cos Θ, where I is the mutual inclina

 tion of the orbital planes of the perturbing and perturbed planets, and Θ the ascending

 node in which the orbital plane of the perturbing planet cuts the orbital plane of the

 perturbed planet. Meanwhile, we still have that ρ — sin i sin θ, q — sin i cos θ, where

 i is the inclination of the orbital plane of the perturbed planet to a fixed xy plane and

 θ is the ascending node in which the orbital plane of the perturbed planet cuts the xy

 plane. In Eq. (3.21), we recall, the fixed xy plane was identified with the orbital plane

 of the perturbed planet at epoch, so that, at epoch, ρ = q = 0. Substitution of (4.14)

 in (3.21) yields immediately

 Equations (4.19) can be simplified ("without loss of rigor," Hansen assures us) by

 stipulating that all longitudes be measured from the node Θ. With this stipulation, we
 find

 Hansen divides the disturbing function for m perturbed by m' into two parts:

 Ω; = — — (4.22a)

 μ Δ

 where

 Δ = [(χ — χ'Ϋ + (y - y')2 + (ζ - ζ')2] ^,

 _ m' χχ' + yy' -Τ ζζ' ,. ...,
 and Ω2 = (4.22b)

 μ r'

 The numerical value of the disturbing function is independent of the coordinate

 system in which it is expressed. Hansen chooses a coordinate system with origin at

 Jupiter.

 The corresponding formulas for m' perturbed by m are written Ω', and Ω2, and are

 the same except that m/μ' replaces m'/μ in both parts, and r3 replaces (r')3 in Ω2.

 These two parts of Q, and such of their derivatives as are needed, are to be expanded

 as series in cosines and sines of the argument (ig + i'g'), where g, g' are the mean

 anomalies of m and m' and i,i' are integers. Thus, putting y for the quantity to be

 expanded, we are to seek an expression of the form

 y = Σ ('> c) cos('£ + i'g') + Σ (ï> i'<s) sin('5 + i'g')' (4.24)

 where the summations are to be extended to enough successive values of i and i' to

 give an adequate approximation to values of y. By what we now call

 Fourier analysis (Hansen had no name for it), the coefficients are given by double

 integrals:

 (ί'l '= (Ιπ)2 / Jo y Sin(l^ + ilgh)dg 'dg'

 Hansen proposes to evaluate these integrals by numerical integration—"mechanical

 quadratures" as they were called in his day. It was his view that, whenever integrals

 are expressible by infinite series, but these prove complicated, the integrations by

 mechanical quadratures are to be preferred.104

 In the eighteenth century, the one notable astronomical application of mechanical

 quadratures had been Clairaut's, in determining the perturbations influencing the date

 of the 1759 return of Halley's Comet.105 The orbital eccentricity of Halley's Comet

 is close to 1, and consequently, trigonometric series with successive terms varying as

 successive powers of the eccentricity converge too slowly to be useful; mechanical

 quadratures are indispensable. In the late 1820s, a number of astronomers undertook

 the numerical integrations required to predict the 1835 return of Halley's Comet.

 With respect to the calculation of planetary perturbations, Euler had advocated the

 use of mechanical quadratures in the 1770s, in particular for the Venusian perturbations

 of the Earth. A comparison of the calculation by mechanical quadratures with that

 by the analytically derived trigonometric series, however, showed the latter to be as

 reliable as the former and less laborious to apply.106 Hansen appears to have been

 the first since Euler to apply mechanical quadratures to the calculation of planetary

 468 C. Wilson

 perturbations.

 Bessel in several memoirs had advocated mechanical quadratures for the investi

 gation of periodic phenomena; Hansen cites two of these memoirs.107 For Hansen,

 the resort to mechanical quadratures, to replace the analytic development of planetary

 perturbations endorsed by Lagrange and Laplace, had the special advantage of admit

 ting of multiple cross-checks, whereby to insure the correctness of the calculation.

 Fifty years later, G.W. Hill would follow Hansen's lead in this matter.

 To commence his calculation, Hansen adopts the orbital elements that Bouvard had

 assigned to Jupiter and Saturn for the end of 1799.108 As Hansen observes, orbital
 elements calculated directly from observations require correction because the obser

 vations involve the perturbations. Thus, if we were starting "from scratch," it would

 be necessary first to compute orbital elements from observations uncorrected for per

 turbation, to compute perturbations using these approximate elements, and thirdly,

 having subtracted the perturbations out of the observations, and then to re-compute

 the orbital elements. This approximative process might have to be repeated several
 times. Hansen assumes, however, that Bouvard's orbital elements have already been

 corrected in this manner, and differ negligibly from those that would obtain if pertur
 bations were absent.

 With these elements, and the standard elliptic formulas as in (2.1a, b, c), (2.3), (2.4)

 above, Hansen can compute the solar distance of Jupiter or Saturn for a given angle of

 either true or mean anomaly, and thence determine the distance (Δ) between the two

 planets by the cosine law of trigonometry. From Δ, he can compute the corresponding

 numerical values of Ωι and Ω\. Likewise, after determining χ, y, ζ and χ', y', ζ1 from

 the values of r, r', u, u', and I, he can compute Ω2 and Ω2. In this case, however,
 Hansen first computes the quantity

 ψ = —rr' jcos2 cos(u - u') + sin2 cos(u + «')

 (4.26)

 Ω2 and Ω2 are then given, respectively, by ηχ'ψ/μr'3 and m'ψ/μ'τ3.

 106 See Wilson (1980), 193-196.

 107 Namely, Bessel's (1828) and his 1826. Bessel had written earlier on this same topic; Whittaker and
 Robinson (1967) [a republication of the fourth edition (1944)], in their discussion of "Practical Fourier

 Analysis" (p. 264), specifically cite Bessel's account in the Konigsberger Beobachtungen, I Abt. p. fii

 Hansen's method 469

 Hansen now divides each of the two orbits into 32 parts, with each part consisting of

 360°/32 = 11° 15' of mean anomaly, and the division beginning at perihelion in each

 orbit. He draws up a table giving the numerical values of log r, r2, u, log r\ r'2, m'.109

 (The quantities u, we recall, are ν - Θ, ν' - Θ', where υ, ν' are the true longitudes,

 and Θ, Θ', 180° apart, are the ascending nodes of the one orbit on the other.) He is thus

 in a position to compute the numerical values of any periodical quantity, such as Ωι.

 or ψ, corresponding to any pair of mean anomalies, g, g' among the selected dividing

 points. Early in his calculation, Hansen concluded that the division of Saturn's orbit

 could be reduced to 16 points without prejudice to the precision he was aiming at. The

 total number of pairs of points was thus 32 χ 16 = 512.

 For mechanical quadratures, the numerical values of the periodic quantity y must

 be computed for all 512 of these pairs of points. Next, the two integrations indicated

 in the double-integrals (4.25) must be carried out in sequence. One of the planets is

 assigned a fixed position, while the position of the other is allowed to vary. Consider,

 for instance, the case in which Saturn is assigned its perihelion position, for which

 i' = 0, while i, the index for Jupiter, goes from 0 to 31. Let the values of y for these
 32 pairs of values be designated fyo. I'l.O. *2,0 Î3i,o· Then by the precepts for

 Hansen computes these coefficients for integral values of r — 1 to r — 16. (A graph

 of y against g shows y varying smoothly between its maximum and its minimum,

 without apparent minor wobbles; the first terms of (4.23) are thus much the largest,

 and later coefficients in the series diminish rapidly to negligible size.) For r = 2,3,

 etc., a set of algorithms, based on the periodic recurrence of values in the sequence of

 cosines and sines of successive multiples of the angle 2π/32, reduces the labor of the

 computation.

 The same task is to be repeated for the cases in which Saturn is held fixed in its

 other 15 pre-assigned positions, from i' = 1 to i' = 15. These computations yield the

 following 16 χ 16 array of coefficients:

 (0; c)ο, (1; c)0, (2; c)0,... to (16; c)0

 (0; c)j, (1; c)!, (2; ,... to (16; c)t

 ... to

 (0; c)15 , (1; c) j5, (2; c)15 ,... to (16; c)15

 A similar array is formed by the coefficients (i; s)i>, except that the coefficients (16; sh
 are all zero.

 Turning now to the second integration, Hansen forms the following coefficients,

 where i in each formula is a fixed integer, but there are as many formulas of the form

 (i, r; c, c') or (i, r; c, s') as values of i, namely 32:

 (i, 0; c, c') = — Σ (*'< c)i'>

 In an entirely similar manner are formed the coefficients (i, i' : s, c') and (i, s, s'),

 starting from the coefficients (ï; s),·'. The numerical integration has thus yielded the

 coefficients that would be expressed analytically by

 (i, i'· c, c') = J J y cos ig ■ cos i'g ■ dg · dg',

 4.7 Bouvard's and Hansen's first-order perturbations of the longitude compared

 After Hansen has described in detail his procedures for computing the first-order

 perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn, he presents, on pp. 73-79 of the Untersuchung,

 his calculated results for these perturbations. Are they accurate? How do they compare

 with Bouvard's results, published just 10 years earlier?

 The following comparison is restricted to terms in the longitude. Bouvard supplies,

 in addition to the great inequality, 23 perturbational terms for Jupiter due to Saturn and

 17 for Saturn due to Jupiter; each term is expressed as a sine term with an amplitude

 and a phase constant (in a few cases, the latter is equal to zero). Hansen at this point,

 however, presents each perturbational term as a sine-cosine pair of terms, without

 phase constants; of these pairs, we find 54 for Jupiter and 52 for Saturn. The net that

 Hansen is here casting thus has finer mesh.

 To assess the accuracy of these results, a convenient and accurate standard is avail

 able in the perturbational formulas given by G.W, Hill in his A New Theory of Jupiter

 and Saturn, published 59 years after Hansen's Untersuchung.m Hill's theory was

 adapted to a large number of observations and became the basis of the tables of Jupiter

 111 Hill (1890,1906).

 and Saturn in the American Nautical Almanac from 1900 to 1959. In developing his

 theory, Hill follows Hansen's method. As we might have anticipated, however, in one

 respect, Hill's results are not fully comparable with Bouvard's and Hansen's: Bouvard

 and Hansen started their respective calculations with the same values (Bouvard's)

 for the planetary masses and for the orbital elements at the epoch of January 0,1800,

 whereas Hill's calculation was based on later, improved values of these constants, with

 the epoch taken as January 0,1850. As to the differences in orbital elements, no simple

 or convenient way exists for determining their effect on perturbational coefficients.

 Since the differences are small, we are probably safe in supposing the effects small.

 In another respect, the difference in computational basis can be compensated for.

 As compared with Bouvard's values, Hill has increased Jupiter's relative mass in the
 ratio 1070.5/1047.9 = 1.02159 and Saturn's relative mass in the ratio 3512/3501.6 =

 1.00297. The masses are linear factors in the perturbations that each planet causes in

 the other; hence, by multiplying Bouvard's and Hansen's perturbational coefficients

 for Saturn by 1.02159 and their perturbational coefficients for Jupiter by 1.00297, we

 shall obtain coefficients more nearly comparable to Hill's.

 In the comparison, the perturbational terms of the three authors must be expressed

 in the same units, and as functions of the same variables.

 Bouvard expresses perturbations in centesimal units, that is, in centesimal degrees

 of which there are 100 per quadrant, centesimal minutes of which there are 100 per

 centesimal degree, and centesimal seconds of which there are 100 per centesimal
 minute. Hansen and Hill use the traditional sexagesimal system, with 90 degrees

 per quadrant, 60min/degree, and 60s/min. (The French astronomers had adopted the

 centesimal system shortly after the founding of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1795, but

 officially abandoned it in the late 1820s; G.B. Airy called this the most retrograde step

 that had ever been taken in astronomy.) To turn centesimal degrees into sexagesimal

 degrees, the multiplying factor is 0.9; to turn centesimal arcseconds into sexagesimal

 arcseconds, the multiplying factor is 0.324.

 In Bouvard's representation of perturbations, the variables are the mean longitudes

 of the planets, and for Jupiter and Saturn, these mean longitudes incorporate the "great

 inequality," and in Saturn's case a long-term perturbation due to Uranus. Thus, Bouvard

 gives the mean longitudes of Jupiter and Saturn as

 <p = e + nt + A, φ' — ε' + n't + A',

 where ε, ε' are the mean longitudes of the two planets at epoch; n, n' are their rates

 of mean motion, and A, A' are the long-term inequalities which Bouvard, following

 Laplace, includes in the mean motions. Hansen and Hill represent the perturbations in

 terms of the mean anomalies, which are given for each planet by the mean longitude

 minus the longitude of the perihelion. Hansen's mean anomalies for Jupiter and Saturn

 are consequently

 g = ε + nt - m, g' = ε' + n't - m',

 where ε, ε', η, η' have the same meanings as for Bouvard, andnr, m' are the longitudes

 of the two perihelia at epoch. It follows that

 Hansen's method 473

 φ = g + m + A, <p' = g' + m' + A'.

 Using Bouvard's values for w, tu' and A, A' at epoch, that is at the beginning of 1800,
 and expressing these values in sexagesimal units, we find

 ψ = g + 11 ·°4558, φ' =g' + 88.°3490.

 These equations enable us to put Bouvard's perturbations in Hansen's form.

 Bouvard gives no indication as to which of the terms in his tables incorporate

 second-order perturbations. In the Mécanique Céleste, Vol. Ill, Laplace names,

 besides the great inequality, two inequalities in the theory of Jupiter and two inequal

 ities in the theory of Saturn, as containing second-order perturbations;112 we shall

 exclude those terms from our comparison.

 Following Hansen, we give the coefficients in sexagesimal arcseconds to three

 decimal places (Hill gives four decimal places). The Bouvardian and Hansenian per
 turbations for Jupiter, with their errors, are as follows:

 The root-mean-square errors, given in the final row of each table, show the greater

 accuracy of Hansen's perturbational coefficients. Besides the terms in these tables and
 the three Bouvardian terms excluded from each table, Hansen has calculated additional

 first-order terms, 30 in the case of Jupiter and 33 in the case of Saturn. The coefficients

 of these additional terms are close in value to Hill's coefficients: in the case of Jupiter,

 the root-mean-square average of the differences (Hansen-Hill) for the sine terms is

 0".Q05 and for the cosine terms, 0".009. The corresponding numbers for Saturn are
 0//.009 and 0".019. Grouping these additional sine-cosine pairs according to the size

 of the largest coefficient in each, we find the following:

 pairs each for Jupiter and Saturn, a large majority of them with coefficients less than
 0".01.

 Hansen's method 475

 omitted 10 terms in the theory of Jupiter and 6 terms in the theory of Saturn, with

 coefficients exceeding this lower bound. All these terms are included by Hansen, along
 with others still smaller.

 The chief advantage of Hansen's method, according to Hansen, was in introducing

 systematic procedures for the calculation of second- and higher-order perturbations.

 However, his calculation of first-order perturbations was also superior to the Laplace

 Bouvard calculation, here too because of its systematic character.

 5 Hansen's Untersuchung: second-order perturbations

 5.1 Second-order perturbations of the longitude

 For the calculation of the second-order perturbations, Hansen returns to equation

 (3.16), here repeated as (5.1):

 - . cos(u - λ) - 1 + — «—[cos(t> - λ) - 1]

 dr I r a( 1 - e2)

 VT - e2 dv

 an 9Ω

 +— sin (υ - λ) r —-, (5.1)

 2p . / ,N an 3Ω
 r VI - e2 dr

 The expression on the left-hand side of this equation has previously been symbolized

 as Γ. Hansen now divides Τ into two parts:

 Τ = Τι + Γ2,

 where Γι represents quantities of the first order—already determined in the earlier
 calculation—and Γ2, quantities of the second order, now to be determined.

 As (5.1) shows, T, and hence Γ2, is a function of λ, υ, ρ, r, and the expressions
 involving a and (1 - e2); moreover, through the partial derivatives of Q, it is also a
 function of υ', r' and of the two variables Ρ and Q, which determine the intersection

 and inclination of the orbital planes of the perturbed planet m and the perturbing planet

 m' (For the sake of simplicity, we consider in this account only one perturbing planet,

 whereas Hansen's account allows for a plurality of perturbing planets.)

 The variable λ, as determined in the first-order calculation, is a function of ηζ, which

 has undergone the increment η(ζ) = ηζ —ητ due to perturbation. In a parallel way,
 the variable ν is a function of nz, which as determined in the first-order calculation has

 undergone the increment n(z) = nz-nt. Similarly, the variable v' is a function of n'z',

 which through first-order perturbation has undergone the incrementn'(z') = n'z'-n't,

 and this increment will have an effect on the second-order perturbations of m. The

 variables In p, In r, In r', owing to perturbation, have undergone the increments ln(p),

 ln(r), and ln(r'), respectively. Taking account of all the increments due to the first

 order perturbations, and remembering that γ = ητ + ε - ώ, so that d · nr = dy,
 and that g = nt + ε - ώ, so that d · nt = dg, Hansen infers by Taylor's theorem
 that

 Finally, we must identify δ Ρ and SQ in (5.2). The variables Ρ and Q are defined in

 terms of the mutual inclination I of the orbital planes of the perturbing and perturbed

 planets, and the ascending node Θ of the orbital plane of the perturbing planet (m')
 on the orbital plane of the perturbed planet (m): Ρ = sin I sin Θ, Q = sin I cos Θ.

 Equation (3.24) of Sect. 3.4 gives Ρ and Q in terms of p, q and p', q' the variables that

 relate the orbital planes of m and m! to a fixed xy plane. The larger (first-order) terms
 of (3.24) are

 p = p' - p, Q = q' -q\ (<*)

 the smaller terms, which are of the third order, can according to Hansen be neglected,

 because the angle of inclination of the orbital planes of Jupiter and Saturn is so small.

 As the choice of the xy plane is arbitrary, this plane can be identified with the orbital

 plane of m at the epoch. With this identification, p, q come to express the change in

 orientation of this plane since the epoch, because at the epoch ρ = q = 0. In order

 to express the latitude of the second planet m' in a similar way, Hansen would like

 to express by the symbols p', q' the change in orientation of the orbital plane of m!

 since the epoch. But ρ', q' as used in (3.24) and (a) above relate the orbital plane of

 m' to a fixed xy plane, just now identified with the orbital plane of m at the epoch. A

 change of symbols is therefore required. In a first step, Hansen replaces the ρ', q' of
 (3.24) and (a) by new symbols, x' and y'. Equations (a) become

 P = x'-p, Q = y'-q. (β)

 Next, he reintroduces the symbols p' and q', so defined that, at the epoch, p' — q' = 0.

 To relate χ', y' to the new ρ', q', we must take account of the angle (I) between the two

 orbital planes at the epoch, and the orientation at the epoch of the nodal line in which

 they intersect; as the measure of the latter, we choose the longitude of the ascending

 node of the orbit of m on the orbit of m', symbolized by (Θ')· Let the variables

 determining these relations be (P) and (Q), defined by (P) = sin(/) sin(©')and(Q) =
 sin(/)cos(0')· Then the new p',q' will be given to first order, in accordance with

 (3.24), by

 p'=x'-(P), q' = y'-(Q). (γ)

 Using (y) to replace x', y' in (β), we obtain

 P = (P) + p'-p, Q = (Q) + q'-q. (8)

 Since (P) and (Q) are constants, and p', q' like p, q now measure changes since the

 epoch, we can express the changes in Ρ and Q since epoch by

 8P = p' - p, SQ = q'-q. (ε)

 But Hansen would like the longitudes of both m and m! to be measured from the same

 starting point, and this can be accomplished by shifting the node used in x', y', and

 hence in p', q', 180° from the ascending node Θ' of the orbit of m on the orbit of m!

 to the ascending node θ of the orbit of m! on the orbit of m. This shift changes p' and

 q' into —p' and -q'. Hansen's final form for (ε) is thus:115

 Hansen's method 479

 SP = -(P' + P), SQ = -(q'+q). (5.7)

 In (5.9), the first term on the right, f 7)dr, gives all and only the first-order per
 turbations in the longitude; this term can therefore be ignored in the second-order
 calculation. But to obtain all the second-order terms, a further differentiation with

 respect to χ is necessary ; the result is

 The second and third terms on the right-hand side are second-order terms emerging
 from the second differentiation. (Note that, because d(0/dr = 1 +d£/dr, the second

 derivatives of ζ and (0 with respect to χ are identical.) The last two terms on the

 right-hand side of (5.10) are of the third order, hence to be neglected in the present
 calculation.

 Every term on the right-hand side of (5.11) is a product of two factors. To pre
 pare (5.11) for numerical calculation, Hansen reduces each factor to the form

 Σ [Ps sin (κ: y + ig + i'g') + pc cos(*:y + ig + i'g')], where the coefficients ps and
 pc are generally constants but may involve t or t2. The factors T\, n(z), ln(r) have

 already been reduced to the required form in the first-order calculation. Moreover,

 from the series expansion for 7\, the derivatives dTi/dy, dT\/dg, dT\/dg' can be

 immediately derived. The required formulas for (ζ) and its first and second partial

 derivatives are obtainable from equations (4.3) and (4.4) in Sect. 4.2. The first-order
 perturbations of the perturbing planet m' as expressed in n'(z'), In(r'), p', q' are
 presupposed in (5.11), and so must be calculated. Starting from the definition of
 S in (4.8), namely S = 21n(p) + ά(ζ)/άτ, Hansen develops the series expression
 S = cos(ig + i'g') + Ns sin (ig + i'g')], from which dS/dt can be immediately
 derived. For the reduction in certain further quantities—of V, V' as given in (5.3), of

 U as given in (5.4), and of dT\/dP, dT\/dQ as given in (5.6)—to the proper form,
 Hansen has recourse to the Besselian expansions introduced in Sect. 4.2 above. We
 omit the details.

 Once the factors are in the required form, they must be multiplied to form the

 products indicated in (5.11). Each factor being in the form of a potentially infinite but

 apparently converging series, the product will consist of a potential infinity of product

 terms. Suppose a term in one factor of one of these products is (pc cos α + qs sin a),

 and a term in the other factor is (qs sin b + qc cos b), their product will be

 (^PcQs + \ps<1c} sin(fl + b)+ (r^PcIc + \ps1s^ cos (a + b)

 +

 - \prt?j sin (-a + b) -F Qpcqc + \prts} cos(-a + b).

 (5.12)

 On forming this product, Hansen adds together the logarithms of the numbers entering

 into the products contained in the coefficients; and in the sum, he includes the logarithm

 of 206,265, the number of arcseconds per radian, so that the coefficient will be given

 in arcseconds. The numerical result in each case shows whether the particular product

 leads to a significant result, larger than the number that Hansen has set as a lower

 bound. The first product calculated will be that of the initial and hence largest terms

 in the series expression of either factor; the products later calculated will be of the

 successively smaller terms in either factor. As Hansen remarks, "...here there is no

 Hansen's method 481

 seeking out of terms that can give a significant result, but those that cannot be neglected

 emerge as though of themselves."116 It is the converging in the component series, and

 the continuity of Hansen's process in forming the term-by-term sub-products, that

 underlie his confidence in not missing any significant term.

 As already mentioned, some of the coefficients ps, pc, qs, qc will contain t or t2

 as a factor; the result will be a term in the product whose coefficient is subject to

 secular variation. Another circumstance in which t2 can emerge outside the arguments

 of sine or cosine is when the two terms multiplied to form a product both contain

 the same sinusoidal factor, call it cos a or sin a. The product will contain cos2 a =

 (1 + cos 2a)/2 or sin2 a — (1 - cos 2a)/2; in either case a constant, say a, appears

 in (5.11). The double-integration that (5.11) requires then leads to a term at2 in ζ. As

 Hansen points out, when all such terms are added up, the net result should be zero. For,

 a term of the form at2 in ζ would imply a term proportional to the time in the semi

 major axis; but such a consequence is impossible. Poisson first, and later Lagrange and

 Laplace, proved that, to the order of the squares and products of the perturbing forces,

 no such term can arise. Hansen proposes that all such terms produced in the calculation

 be collected and added together, as a check on the accuracy of the calculation. The

 sum cannot be expected to be exactly zero, but it should approach zero to within the

 limits of accuracy set for the calculation.

 In this calculation, Hansen stresses the importance of systematic procedures guided

 by clear schemata and multiple cross-checks on the correctness of the calculation.117

 Mitigating the labor is the fact that the second-order contributions to perturbational

 terms are smaller than the first-order contributions, so that fewer significant figures

 need be retained. That the second-order contributions should be smaller is not a pri

 ori necessary, but the calculator finds it so in the perturbations encountered in the
 solar system. Where he not to find it so, Hansen observes, the method of successive

 approximations would not be applicable.118

 Equation (5.11), after the reductions described, has the general form119

 Just as in the first-order integration leading from άζ/dt to ζ [see Eq. (4.3] of Sect. 4.2),

 so here, when not only i and i ' are zero, but κ is also zero, there emerge terms in (5.16a)

 of the form (coefficient) nt ■ cos 0 = c'nt, where c' is a constant. The effect is to cause
 the observational value of the mean motion to differ from the mean motion that would

 obtain in the absence of perturbation. To (4.3), Hansen added the integrative constant

 n(l — c)τ, in order that η could be assigned its observational value. With the same end

 in view here, he treats c' as a correction to c, and in (5.16) makes the additive constant

 5.2 Second-order perturbations of the radius vector

 We have seen how, in determining the first-order perturbations of the logarithm of
 the radius vector (in Sect. 4.3), Hansen made use of Eq. (3.18) from Sect. 3.3 above,

 first deleting the second term on the left and setting 3£/3τ = 1. For the second-order

 perturbations, he again turns to Eq. (3.18); but now he deletes nothing, and allows for

 the increment 3(f )/3r in the value of 3ζ/3τ. The equation can be written

 Equation (5.18) is integrable, yielding

 31n(p) dS (517)

 3r 3t  m

 where the last two terms on the right are the result of carrying out the differentiation

 with respect to r indicated in (3.18) by

 Multiplying through by 3£/3r, and rearranging terms, we can put (5.17) in the

 form

 ^d.ln(p) d5 , gtfc

 This equation—since S is free of τ—can be rewritten as

 d. |21n(p) — S + In.|^| qç d. |21n(p) - S + ln.^-J

 di 3τ dx dt

 (5.18)

 21n(p) — S + ln.^· = φ(ζ). (5.19)

 With a view to determining the nature of φ (ζ), Hansen considers that, in the absence
 of perturbing forces, 5 = 0, and 3ζ/3τ = 1, so that ln(3f/3r) = 0 and ζ = τ.
 Consequently, φ(ζ) = φ (τ) and 21η(ρ) = φ (τ). According to Hansen,

 Here In (ρ) = 0, or rather is equal to a constant, because we have stipulated that in

 the calculation of ln(p), the value of (In a) to be applied is not the purely elliptical

 value, but rather the value that is given by the observationally determined value
 of n.120

 Let us first observe that, besides (In a), ln(p) contains two other terms:

 In (p) = In a + In ^1 - e2^j - In (1 + e cos [λ - m]).

 Hansen passes over the second and third terms on the right without mention. The
 second differs little from zero; the third is confined to values between ln(l + e) and

 ln(l - e), never far from zero. According to the passage just quoted, the first term, In

 a, differs from zero because a, derived from the observationally determined value of n,

 differs from ao the value of the semi-transverse axis that would obtain if perturbation

 were absent (Hansen has evidently normalized ao to 1.) The first term outweighs the

 others, and its constancy is the ground Hansen gives for asserting that, in the absence

 of perturbation, ln(p) is a constant.

 From the constancy of ln(p), Hansen infers that φ (τ) is a constant and concludes

 that φ (ζ) must also be a constant.121 Hence,

 ln(p) = ^5 - ^ In .j- + Const. (5.20)

 higher-order terms—for the logarithm on the right- hand side of (5.20), and further

 asks us to suppose that the constant has been incorporated in 5:

 The constant incorporated in S, we recall, is (In a), which cannot be the constant of

 integration in (5.23). Therefore, comparing (5.23) with (5.24), Hansen concludes that
 the constant in (5.23) is

 To determine d(z)/di, we return to the equation for ηζ. The perturbations have been

 shown to produce an addition to the mean motion equal to n(c + c')t. Therefore, the

 constant added when ηζ is obtained by integration is n(l - c - c')τ; this choice being

 such that, when τ -*■ t,nz is given by nt + periodic perturbational terms. To find η(ζ),

 we must delete the added constant from ηζ. Then, the part of η(ζ) and hence of n(z)

 that is directly proportional to t will be n(c + c')t, and hence

 d(z)

 where k is the constant emerging from the periodic perturbational terms when d(z)/dt

 is squared. We therefore have

 1 1/1 2 1,
 Const. = —-c - -c + -c + -k.

 As in Sect. 4.3, Hansen adjusts the constant to take account of the difference between

 (In ao) and (In a), namely to quantities of the second order,

 Adding these terms to the above expression for the constant, we shall have

 But the first term in the constant was already produced in the first-order calculation of

 ln(r); Hansen therefore deletes it in writing the second-order contribution to ln(r):

 In calculating ln(r), then, we are directed to return to Eqs. (5.16) and (5.16a) for ηζ,

 and to differentiate ζ, twice with respect to r as required for the right-hand side of

 5.3 Second-order perturbations of the latitude

 Differential equations embodying the first-order perturbations of the latitude were

 given in equations (4.19) for dp/dt and dq/dt (Sect. 4.5). By taking Θ as the origin
 of longitudes, equations (4.19) were simplified to yield equations (4.20), and the
 latter equations were integrated to yield equations (4.21) and (4.21a), giving ρ and q

 varying in time as the first-order perturbations require. In all these formulas, Hansen

 took account only of perturbations due to a single perturbing planet. In deriving the

 second-order perturbations (Untersuchung, pp. 123-131), however, he includes in his

 formulas terms representing the perturbations due to additional perturbing planets.

 These complications will here be omitted: we shall confine our endeavor to sketching

 the main steps of Hansen's procedure for the second-order perturbations produced by

 a single perturbing planet.

 Hansen begins, as in deriving the second-order perturbations of ζ, by applying Tay

 lor's theorem. Let dp/dt and dq/dt remain the symbols for the time rates of change

 of ρ and q due to first-order perturbations, as given in (4.15), and let us introduce

 special symbols (Hansen supplies none) for the time rates of change of ρ and q due

 to second-order perturbations, namely (3^)2. (3^)2- To obtain formulas for the lat
 ter, we must take account of increments to dp/dt and dq/dt due to the first-order
 increments

 Hansen's method 487

 The expressions for dp/dt and dq/dt in (4.15) contain and since

 Hansen has already computed the value of S as affected by first-order perturbations

 (as a way of checking his calculation of ln(r): see Eq. (4.13)), and dS/dt is immediately

 obtainable from S by differentiation, it is convenient to separate the parts of equations

 (4.15) that do not contain dS/dt from those that do. Hansen introduces special symbols

 for the parts not containing dS/df; we shall use dp/dt and dq/dt for this purpose:

 dp _ dp Ρ dS dp dq Q dS
 df dt 1 + cos I di dr dt 1 + cos I dt '

 Finally, he designates the second-order perturbations in S by 52. He then obtains the

 following formulas for the second-order perturbations:

 di dgdt dg'dt K ' 9rdt dr'dt v '

 Just as in (5.2), so in (5.28), the terms on the right-hand side can be characterized as

 consisting of two factors, the first being a derivative of some part of dp/dt or dq/dt

 with respect to a variable and the second being an increment in the said variable. The

 first term on the right-hand side, in each case, may appear to be an exception but is

 As in the case of equations (4.19), the equations (5.28) are simplified somewhat

 by stipulating that all longitudes be measured from Θ = 0. By a lengthy sequence of

 reductions, Hansen puts the right-hand members of equations (5.28) in the form

 nHc cos X + nHs sinX + nH'cnt cos X + nH'snt sin X,

 where, as earlier, X = ig + i'g'. The integral, except when X = 0, is of the form

 [fHc + f2H's) sin* - [fHs - f2H'c) cos*

 +fH'snt sin X - fH'snt cos X,

 where, as before, / = n/(in + i'n'). When X = 0, the integral is of the form

 5.4 Hansen's perturbations in the longitude of Saturn compared to Hill's

 Hansen in the Untersuchung lists his results for second-order perturbations only in

 the case of Saturn (Untersuchung, pp. 166-170). The means we have used previously

 for assessing the accuracy of Hansen's results—namely comparison with the corre

 sponding results provided by Hill—are not available here, for the terms Hill gives

 as "second-order perturbations of Saturn" are not solely of the second order. As Hill
 explains:122

 Being now in possession of the several factors of the terms of ST and ST', we

 could proceed immediately to the calculation of the terms, strictly of the second

 order, which arise from these quantities. But the more important parts of these

 functions are the terms coming from the secular variations of the elements.

 This prominence is kept up in the terms of the third, and apparently of all higher

 orders. And it is, perhaps, the most surprising instance in the planetary theories

 of a lack of convergence that the secular variations of the eccentricities and

 places of the perihelia of Jupiter and Saturn are augmented about a fourth part

 by the terms of the second order with respect to disturbing forces. Since the mass

 of Jupiter is less than 1/1000 of that of the Sun it would naturally be supposed
 that tihe ratio of the second to the first-order terms would be somewhere in the

 neighborhood of this fraction. It is, however, 250 times larger.

 By far the larger portions of these second-order terms arise from the terms of

 ST and ST', having severally the arguments γ and γ'. By computing these por

 tions at the outset, and annexing them to the first-order terms corresponding to

 the same arguments before proceeding to the general calculation of ST and ST',
 we shall include in the determination of the second-order terms the more notable

 122 A New Theory of Jupiter and Saturn as cited in note 38, p. 249.

 portion of the third-order terms. In like manner, on arriving at the general compu

 tation of the latter, we shall first compute the terms having the arguments γ and

 γ', and annexing them to the second-order terms, shall then be able to include

 the more remarkable portion of the fourth-order terms in that of the third....

 In sum, Hill's processes after calculation of the first-order perturbations cease to be

 strictly comparable with Hansen's.

 To give an idea of the accuracy Hansen achieves, I shall compare his final results for

 the non-secular perturbations in the longitude of Saturn (that is, the terms not factored

 by n't or its powers) and compare them with the corresponding terms in Hill's theory.

 Hansen's values are given in the Untersuchung on pp. 189-190; Hill's values are given

 in A New Theory of Jupiter and Saturn on pp. 560-563.

 To make Hansen's coefficients comparable with Hill's, I multiply, as earlier, the first

 order coefficients by 1070.5/1047.9 = 1.02159, the factor by which Hill's value for the

 mass of Jupiter is greater than Hansen's. The second-order terms fall into two groups,

 according as they are factored by the square of the mass of Jupiter or by the product

 of the mass of Jupiter by the mass of Saturn. Hansen, recognizing that the values of

 the masses will need to be corrected, gives the terms of the two groups in two separate

 lists. The coefficients of the first group must be multiplied by (1.02159)2 = 1.043646,

 and those of the second group by 1.02159 χ 1.00297 = 1.024624, where 1.00297 is

 the factor by which Hill's value for the mass of Saturn is greater than Hansen's. The

 third-order perturbations are of three kinds, according as they are factored by m3 (the

 cube of Jupiter's mass), m2m', or mm'2; Hansen has calculated only perturbations of

 the first two varieties, and unfortunately does not list them separately. Terms in the

 two groups need to be increased by the factors 1.06618 and 1.04675, respectively;

 I have used instead the average of these two factors. Only six of Hansen's terms in

 the following table include contributions from third-order perturbations, namely those
 with the arguments 4g'-2g, 5g'-2g, 6g'-2g, 8g'-4g,9g'-4g,and 10g'-4g.The
 perturbations are given in the form ko sin(x + Kq), where χ is the argument ig' - ig.

 Among the 47 terms here compared, the differences between Hansen's and Hill's

 coefficients exceed or equal 1 arcsecond in four cases:

 Hansen's method 491

 The coefficients of the first three of these terms are very large; the coefficient of

 the fourth is also sizable. Hansen's failure to carry out a complete calculation of the

 third-order perturbations may play a role in these discrepancies—the sources of which,
 however, will here have to remain unidentified.

 Of the remaining 43 terms, two have coefficients with errors between 1".0 and 0".5,
 and four have coefficients with errors between 0".5 and 0".l. For the 35 terms with

 errors less than 0".l, the root-mean-square error is 0".023.

 Hansen's and Hill's phase constants (Ko) are in roughly satisfactory agreement

 except in two cases, the terms with arguments 6g' - 2g and 9g' - 6g. For the remaining

 45 terms, the root-mean-square difference between Hansen's and Hill's phase constants
 is 4°.37.

 Hill's perturbations for the longitude include 53 terms omitted by Hansen. The

 coefficients of the five largest of these, with their arguments, are

 The last four of these are in a sequence such as Hansen regularly employed in order
 to catch all terms with coefficients above 0".03; his mistaken value for the term with

 argument 8g' - 5g may, by its smallness, have led him to suppose that the succeeding
 terms in the sequence would be negligible. As for the remaining 48 terms omitted

 by Hansen, the root-mean-square average of their coefficients is 0".017, well below

 Hansen's stipulated numerical lower bound.

 The foregoing comparison suggests that Hansen's theory, despite a few errors that it

 contained, would have proved superior to Bouvard's tables as a basis for ephemerides.

 6 Conclusion: what Hansen's method achieves

 On May 8,1830, a few days before at last sending on the text of the Untersuchung to

 the Berlin Akademie's prize committee, Hansen wrote to his friend Bessel, seeking

 to provide a clear if preliminary notion of what "Hansen's Method" achieves,123.

 This letter was a response to a letter from Bessel dated 22 January, in which Bessel

 admitted to not having grasped the force of Hansen's introduction of the time r in the

 new signification that Hansen assigned to it.124 The following two paragraphs give

 what we may take to be the key points of Hansen's response:

 Remarkable in my method are two things which belong exclusively to me,

 namely the choice of two of the coordinates, and the introduction of the unde

 termined quantity τ. Laplace in his theory of the Moon, following the pattern

 of the earlier astronomers, used the time and 1/r as coordinates, both expressed

 in terms of the true longitude; by no means did he use the two coordinates that

 I have used, the mean longitude and the logarithm of the radius vector. And by

 no means is the quantity τ [the same as] the time, for in the integration with

 respect to time, r is treated as a constant; it becomes the time only when the

 undetermined quantities ηζ, and ln(p) go over into those coordinates [that is,

 into the mean longitude and the logarithm of the radius vector just referred to].

 The first thing I brought about was to obtain rigorous differential equations (of

 the first order with respect to time) for the perturbations of the coordinates,

 and indeed such equations as, without transformation, can be developed and

 integrated; this had not been done previously.... Since I have rigorous differential

 equations, I can calculate the perturbations of any order with respect to the masses

 by one and the same rule. In this way I have brought unity into the method of

 calculation—a quality in scientific work on which you [Bessel] justly place great
 store....125

 123 The eleven-page letter is found in Archiv der Berlin-Brandenburgischen Akademie der Wissenschaften.
 Quotations from the original in footnotes 124-127 are given with express permission of the Berlin
 Brandenburgische Akademie, pp. 35r-40r.

 124 Hansen reports this in his letter of May 8,1830. BesseTs letters to Hansen appear not to be extant, so

 that we must rely on Hansen's letters for information about their content. Hansen's letter of January 12,1830

 (misdated 1813!) shows the two friends in a contretemps, stemming from misapprehensions on both sides;

 we need not enter into the particulars. Bessel's letter of 22 January was evidently conciliatory, but Hansen did

 not reply till 8 May; presumably he was preoccupied during the interval with completing the Untersuchung.

 125 The German of the quoted passage, appearing on pp. 36v-37r of the original letter, is as follows:

 "Es sind vorziiglich in meiner Méthode zwei Dinge[,] welche mir eigenthilmlich sind, nâmlich die Wahl

 zweier der Coordinaten und die Einflihnmg der unbestimmten Grftsse τ. Zwei Coordinaten sind von den

 bisher gebrauchten wesentlich verschieden, denn damit[,] dass Laplace nach dem Vorbild der âlteren
 Astronomen in seiner Théorie des Mondes die Zeit und 1/r durch die wahre Lange ausdriickt, hat er

 keinesweges, wie ich es gethan habe, die mittlere Lânge und den Logarithmus des Radius Vectors fiir zwei

 der Coordinaten angenommen. Die Grôsse r ist keinesweges die Zeit, denn sie muss bei den Integrationen

 in Beziehung auf die Zeit constant gesetzt werden, diese Grdsse geht alsdann erst in die Zeit iiber, wenn

 die unbestimmten Grôssen ηζ und l(n) in jene Coordinaten iibergehen sollen."

 "Das erste was[,] ich nun bewirkt habe ist[J dass ich strenge differentiale Gleichungen (von der ersten

 Ordnung in Beziehung auf die Zeit) fiir die Stôrungen der Coordinaten bekommen habe, und zwar solche

 Gleichungen[,] die sich ohne Umwandelung sogleich entwickeln und integriren lassen; dies ist friiher nicht

 "Da ich strenge Differentialgleichungen habe[,] so kann ich die Berechnung der Stôrungen[J die in
 Beziehung auf die Massen von einerlei Ordnung sind, nach einer und derselben Regel berechnen, und
 habe also dadurch in die Berechnungsmethode die Einheit gebracht, auf welche Sie bei wissenschaftlichen

 Arbeiten, mit vollen Recht[,] einen grossen Werthe legen...."

 geleistet...."

 reformulate his differential equation for άζ/àt in a way applicable only in the first

 order approximation—his aim being to take advantage of the superior convergence of
 the series for i?t? It is indeed so.

 In the reformulation, Hansen reintroduces 9Ω/3ε, but the orbital element ε is soon

 replaced by the mean anomaly g which is a linear function of ε. Basically, it is one

 and the same differential equation for άζ/dt that is being solved, and it is the same

 differential equation that is then solved at each of the successive approximations that

 Hansen carries through. The second- and higher-order approximations are obtained by

 means of Taylor's theorem, this route having proved the most efficient. In principle,

 however, all the approximations could have been obtained using the same procedure.

 Let us compare the map of the Hansenian solution with that of the Laplacian

 solution. Laplace's equations (X'), (Y), and (Ζ') (Sect. 2.1) specifically presuppose

 the limitation to perturbations of the first order with respect to the perturbing forces,

 since they incorporate truncated series representing the unperturbed Keplerian motion

 of the perturbed planet (elliptical and in accordance with Kepler's area rule). If the

 approximating series are eliminated, the equations cease to be; the equations cannot

 be reconfigured so as to be made applicable to higher-order approximations. Thus,

 equations (X')> (Ό. and (Z') are in their essence approximative, and essentially limited

 to perturbations of the first order. Hansen's equations, by contrast, are rigorously true of

 the variables they contain, and these variables retain applicability to successive orders

 of approximation. To be sure, their application can be pursued only by approximations

 of successive orders with respect to the perturbing forces. Laplace, by contrast, when

 he turns to perturbations of higher order than the first, uses special computational

 procedures that are incapable of being made systematic.

 Prior to Hansen's development of his new method, the only systematic method

 available for higher-order perturbations was that provided by the Lagrangian equa
 tions for the time rates of change of the orbital elements, combined with successive

 applications of Taylor's theorem. (For the Lagrangian equations, see Eqs. (3.1a) and
 (3.1b) of Sect. 3.2.) But, as Hansen observed at the start of the Disquisitiones, the

 application of these equations entails serious drawbacks. The orbital elements being

 six in number and the coordinates three in number, the perturbations of six quantities

 have to be computed in order to obtain the perturbations of the three coordinates. More

 over, the perturbations of the orbital elements are found to be considerably larger than

 the perturbations of the coordinates they entail, so that the latter have to be computed

 from differences of much larger quantities—an unreliable procedure.

 Hansen's motive for seeking a direct way of computing the perturbations of the coor

 dinates is thus understandable: he was attempting to replace roundabout and unreliable

 computational procedures by direct and reliable ones. Starting from the Lagrangian

 formulas, he carried out a transformation that gave the perturbed mean anomaly and

 perturbed logarithm of the radius vector in terms of partial derivatives of the perturb

 ing function with respect to the coordinates, thus eliminating reference to the orbital

 elements a, e, ε, and m as variables. The only old-style orbital elements remaining

 as variables were those determining the position of the instantaneous orbital plane
 (Hansen's ρ and q).

 Of Hansen's initial choice of the mean anomaly as a coordinate, he offers little in

 justification, but that little suggests that he was seeking to return, insofar as possible,

 to the simple and direct manner of formulating the planetary problem available to

 pre-Newtonian astronomers: given the time, to compute the planet's position. His

 choice proved fortuitous: when he had obtained formulas for άζ/dt and [d ln(p)]/dr

 (namely, our equations (3.16) and (3.17)), there emerged a simple relation between

 the two equations, namely equation (3.18). Since the perturbations in the radial and

 trans-radial directions must be intimately related, their relation would be of interest;

 but the admirable simplicity of (3.18) was a discovery worth celebrating. It meant

 that once the perturbations of the mean anomaly (ηζ ) were computed to any order,

 the corresponding perturbations of [ln(p)] could be written out forthwith, without a

 separate calculation. For this shortcut, Hansen tells Bessei, he is indebted partly to

 the quantity τ and partly to the choice of the coordinates. (The choice of [ln(p)] in

 place of p, we note, is labor-saving only because Hansen is carrying out the numerical

 computations logarithmically.)

 In the remainder of Hansen's account, written for Bessei, the stress is upon (1) the

 efficiencies that the method achieves and (2) the controls on the numerical calculation

 that it provides.

 One of the gains in efficiency came, as just mentioned, from the relation (3.18),

 whereby the perturbations of the radius vector or its logarithm could be determined

 directly from those of the mean longitude.

 Another came from the decision, departing from earlier astronomical practice, to

 compute the perturbations of the mean longitude rather than those of the true longitude:

 The series by which I compute the perturbation coefficients converge more
 rapidly than those known previously; this circumstance, which lends greater

 certainty to the outcome and permits a saving of time in the calculation, I owe

 to the choice of coordinates. I find a posteriori that, calculating these series to

 the precision of a fixed numerical bound, the number of terms giving the per

 turbations of the mean longitude is smaller than the number of terms giving the

 perturbations of the true longitude....126

 Still another increment in efficiency came from eliminating the computation of the

 perturbations of the orbital elements e and m, the eccentricity and the longitude of

 the perihelion:

 If in accordance with the theory of the variation of arbitrary constants one under

 takes to compute the perturbations of the second order, there appear in e and m

 perturbations of the order of 1/e and 1/e2, which are very large if e is small.

 These perturbations disappear if one goes over from the perturbations of the

 126 The German of the quoted passage is from NL Bessel, Nr. 246, p. 37r:

 "Die Reihenf,] durch deren Numeration ich die Stôrungscoefficienten finden muss, convergiren weit mehr als

 die friiher bekannten; diesen Umstand, der sowohl grôssere Sicherheit ins Résultat bringt, als auchpagination

 Zeitersparnis bei der Berechnung der Stôrungen veranlasst, habe ich der Wahl der Coordinaten zu verdanken.
 Auch hat sich a posteriori ergebenf,] dass bis zu einer festen numerischen Grenze herab, die Zahl der

 Stôrungscoefficienten der mittleren Lânge kleiner ist als die der wahren Lange."

 elements to the perturbations of the coordinates; their existence is thus a circum

 stance arising from the unsuitability of the mode of calculation. In my method

 this species of perturbation simply does not appear.127

 Yet a further gain in efficiency, Hansen tells Bessel, is the one exhibited in equations

 (3.7a,b) at the end of Sect. 4.2, whereby coefficients of the sine and cosine terms in ηζ

 for any value of κ could be obtained from the coefficients for which κ = —1,0, +1.

 All these increments in efficiency, Hansen points out, stem ultimately from his choice
 of the mean anomaly as a fundamental variable and from his introduction of the

 quantity τ.

 Turning finally to the conditional equations, he establishes for the numerical cal

 culation (see Sect. 4.4), Hansen tells Bessel that they enable him to guard against the
 least mistake.

 I hold this circumstance, that I can subject the entire calculation to a secure

 control, for an essential advantage of my method. Without the introduction of

 the quantity r neither of the two chief controls would be available.128

 From the foregoing summary, it will be evident that Hansen in devising his method

 was guided by a unifying theoretical idea, the aim of reducing the perturbational

 problem posed by the Newtonian law of gravitation to an older paradigm: given the

 value of a variable functioning as the time or mean longitude, to find the planet's

 position. The computational efficiencies and controls that accompany the method are

 spin-offs from the successful achievement of Hansen's unifying theoretical aim.

 In the computational process that Hansen envisages, the final stage is to consist of

 substituting a temporal variable z into purely Keplerian formulas, in which the orbital

 elements have the values determined observationally for the epoch. In Hansen's analy

 sis, as real-time elapses from the epoch, three processes are occurring: the planet's

 instantaneous orbital plane slowly changes in position; the planet's orbit in the instan

 taneous orbital plane undergoes change because the orbital elements α, ε, e, m vary,

 and the planet moves along its instantaneous orbit. In a step that is not free of risk,

 Hansen initially sets the first of these processes aside, proposing to deal with it later,
 and focuses on the second and third.

 To obtain a mathematical description of the motion of the planet along its orbit while

 the orbit itself is varying in time, Hansen must take account of two things at once, and he

 therefore introduces a variable λ which varies in two ways. On the one hand, λ depends

 on the quantity τ in exactly the same way that the longitude ν would depend on the time

 t in strictly Keplerian motion. On the other hand, λ is a function of the orbital elements

 127 The German of the quoted passage is from NL Bessel, Nr. 246, p. 37 ν : "Wenn man nach der Theorie der

 Verànderung der willkilhrlichen Constanten die Stôrungen der zweiten Ordnung rechnen will, so erscheinen

 in e and ώ Stôrungen[,] welche von der Ordnung 1/e und 1/e2 sind, und also sehr gross werden[,] wenn e

 klein ist. Diese Stôrungen heben sich auf[,] wenn man von den Stôrungen derElemente zu den Stôrungen der

 Coordinaten iibergeht; ihr Daseyn ist daher ein Umstand[,] der grosse Unbequemlichkeit bei der Beiechnung
 verursacht; bei meiner Methode erscheint diese Gattung von Stôrungen gar nicht."

 128 NL Bessel, Nr. 246, p. 37v: "Ich halte auch diesen Umstand, dass ich die ganze Rechnung einer sicheren

 Controlle unterwerfen kann[,] fur einen wesentlichen Vorzug meiner Methode; ohne die Einfiihrung der
 Grôsse r wiirden beide genannten Hauptcontrollen nicht statt finden."

 α, ε, e, m which figure in the equations of Keplerian motion, but which change in

 accordance with the Lagrangian equations (3. la), which give the time rates of change

 of these orbital elements under perturbation. To subsume these two variations under a

 single variation, Hansen makes λ a function of a new variable ζ, which is to play the

 role of an enhanced or perturbable mean longitude. Then ζ in turn must be a function

 of both t and t. The variation of ζ, with t takes account of the variation of the orbital

 elements in accordance with the Lagrangian equations (3.1a). Once this latter variation

 has been accounted for (by integration), τ can be changed into t.

 Simultaneously, Hansen stipulates that ζ is to become z, so that z is the perturbed

 mean longitude, substitutable into the Keplerian equations using the values of the

 orbital elements determined observationally for the epoch. Once the perturbed longi

 tude is known, equation (3.18) can supply the perturbed radius vector in the instanta

 neous plane without further calculation.

 Hansen's postponement of the problem of the position of the instantaneous plane,

 as suggested earlier, was potentially risky; and indeed, Hansen initially fell into error

 by assuming the motion of the instantaneous plane to be strictly separable from the

 motion in longitude (see Sect. 3.4). He thus arrived at the erroneous equation (3.25).

 In the Untersuchung, he stepped back from this mistake (see Sect. 4.5) by making

 9Ω/9ρ and δΩ/dq dependent on 9Ω/9υ. He did not, however, supply a geometrical

 derivation or justification for the resulting equation (namely (4.18)). That would first

 be done by Cayley.129 It remains true that Hansen, in marked contrast to Laplace,

 addressed the problem of perturbation in latitude in a way capable of being made

 systematic for successive orders of perturbation.

 In sum, Hansen's method emerged out of a sustained endeavor to introduce logi

 cal rigor and unity into the practical approximative business of celestial mechanics.

 To bring this aspect of Hansen's undertaking into focus has been the purpose of the

 present study.
