 Abstract According to the received view, the first spyglass was assembled with
 out any theory of how the instrument magnifies. Galileo, who was the first to use
 the device as a scientific instrument, improved the power of magnification up to 30
 times. How did he accomplish this feat? Galileo does not tell us what he did. We

 hold that such improvement of magnification is too intricate a problem to be solved
 by trial and error, accidentally stumbling upon a complex procedure. We construct a

 plausibility argument and submit that Galileo had a theory of the telescope. He could
 develop it by analogical reasoning based on the phenomenon of reflection in mirrors—
 as it was put to use in surveying instruments—and applied to refraction in sets of
 lenses. Galileo could appeal to this analogy and assume Delia Porta's theory of refrac
 tion. He could thus turn the spyglass into a revolutionary scientific instrument—the
 telescope.

 1 The problem

 The course of events between July 1609, when Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) first took
 interest in the telescope, and March 1610, when he published his Side reus nuncius, is

 well known.' Yet scholars are still perplexed by the question whether Galileo knew
 how does the telescope function? Given the extant documents and the recent sec
 ondary literature, it appears that this is a moot question.2 To be sure, the instrument

 itself is available and the practice is known, for Galileo tells the reader on different
 occasions what he did with the telescope. The motivating question is, then, how did

 Galileo transform a toy into a scientific instrument? How did he turn the Dutch tubular
 spectacle into an astronomical telescope?

 In the summer of 1609, Galileo made a telescope that magnified 8 times and by
 January 1610 he had instruments that magnified 14, 21, and about 30 times. Optical
 analyses of the telescopes attributed to Galileo show that to get magnification of 14
 times he had to produce lenses of 0.75 diopter for the objective and 10.64 diopter
 for the eyepiece (1330 and 94 mm, respectively). To get magnification of 21 times,

 Galileo had to produce lenses of 1.02 diopter for the objective and 21 diopter for the

 eyepiece (980 and 47.5 mm, respectively). And, for the telescope that magnified about

 30 times, Galileo manufactured an objective lens of 0.585 diopter and an eyepiece of
 about 17.5 diopter (1710 and 57 mm, respectively).3 These types of lenses were not
 available in the spectacle market;4 they had to be ordered to specification.5 How did
 Galileo come up with these specifications?

 It has been argued that the invention of the Dutch telescope became possible only

 because of the aperture stop.6 This claim has to be modified. The aperture stop indeed

 helps remedy the adverse effects of optical aberrations, but only during the final tuning

 phases of the telescope, i.e., when the instrument is already in hand.7 More critical is

 the effect that arises from the intrinsic optical features of the Galilean layout (i.e., con

 vex objective and concave eyepiece). To clarify this point, let us examine the Galilean
 telescope that magnifies 21 times. The telescope's 1,02-diopter plano-convex objective
 has a focal length of 980 mm, a central thickness of 2 mm, and an aperture diameter of

 thank Giuseppe Molesini of the National Institute of Applied Optics, Arcetri, Florence, for providing us
 with his detailed computations and interferometric images of the Galilean telescopes and their lenses.

 6 Willach (2008, pp. 93-97, 103). Note that before 1604, when Kepler explained the formation of the reti
 nal image, the eye lens (crystallina) was assumed to be the organ on which vision occurs. It was common

 knowledge among opticians at the time that the pupil of the eye, functioning as an aperture stop, improved
 the acuity of sight: see Delia Porta (1593, pp. 68-86, 100, 103-105).

 7 Galileo was the first scholar to systematically apply aperture stops. On the calibration method which
 Galileo applied in the final tuning of his telescope, see Zik (1999, pp. 46-47, 52-53; 2001, pp. 266-269).

 16 mm. The 21-diopter bi-concave eyepiece has a focal length of —47.5 mm, and its

 central thickness is 1.8 mm. This means that the diameter of the exit pupil is 0.77 mm,

 while the diameter of the rays crossing the eyepiece is about 4.12 mm. The implication

 is that the bulk of the rays passing through the eyepiece cross section of the Galilean
 layout are less liable to interferences caused by the poor quality of the glass and inad

 equate configuring and polishing techniques of lenses at the time. Aperture stops are
 usually applied to improve resolution in the tuning phases. This is evident by the fact

 that the aperture diameter in Galileo's telescope that magnified 14 times was 26 mm,
 while the telescope that magnified 21 times was stopped at 16 mm.8

 According to the received view, theories available at the time were not conducive to

 determining lens specification for some optical design.9 The implication is that Galileo

 stumbled upon a way to improve the performance of the telescope by appealing to arti

 sanal ingenuity rather than to theoretical know-how. Galileo could not determine the

 magnifying power of the telescope from the focal lengths of his concave and convex

 lenses, so the argument goes, for the simple reason that such concepts and theoretical

 insights were not available at the time. Galileo thus found a reliable method within the
 tradition of sixteenth-century optics and practices of the lens makers, the argument

 continues, that by-passed in some miraculous way the optical theory that we now think
 underwrites his success.10 We question this claim and seek an alternative answer.

 It is inconceivable that one could simply stumble on the (above) "numbers" by
 some procedure of elimination, in a trial-and-error method. For obvious reasons, Gali
 leo was not intent on disclosing his theory of the telescope.11 But, it is clear that
 quantitative ray tracing method, that is, the law of refraction or, in its place, a geo
 metrical scheme, is crucial for the development of an adequate theory of lenses. We
 therefore consider De refractione optices parte (1593) of Giovan Battista Delia Porta

 (1535-1615) a pioneering essay for it offers a quantitative analysis of both reflection
 and refraction.12

 To offer an alternative to the questionable received view, we develop a plausibility

 argument which is based on the following assumptions:

 8 Parameters, such as overall lens length of the telescope, its magnification, proper alignment, and qual
 ity of the lenses, have an effect on the diameter and shape of the aperture stop required for improving the

 resolving power of these relatively crude instruments. In a letter of January 7,1610, [to Antonio de Medici?]
 Galileo wrote (Favaro (1890-1909, 10: 278, letter 259, our translation, italics added): "It would be better
 if the convex lens, which is the furthest from the eye were in part covered, and that the opening which is
 left uncovered be of an oval shape, because in this manner it would be possible to see objects much more
 distinctly." (E bene che il vetro colmo, che e il lontano dall' occhio, sia in parte coperto, et che il pertuso
 che si lascia aperto sia di figura ovale, perche cosi si vedranno li oggetti assai piu distintamente.)

 9 Van Helden makes this remark in a comment on Galileo's claim, namely, how he used the "science of
 refraction" to improve the telescope: see Galileo ([1610] 1989, p. 37, n. 25) and Van Helden (1974, pp.
 40-49). See also footnote 42, below.

 1. Euclid's ray optics establishes geometrical relation between linear magnitudes

 and apparent angles. This scheme is not physical so the relation can be maintained
 independently of causal considerations.

 2. Optical magnification which applies to a range of optical systems, including sur

 veying instruments and telescopes, is defined by the ratio between the apparent
 angle of an object seen through the system and its apparent angle seen by the
 naked eye. This definition is geometrical; it has nothing to do with image forma

 tion, image resolution, or visual perception.

 3. The improved performance of any optical system which includes a set of lenses

 is critically dependent on the phenomenon of refraction.

 We claim:

 4. The theory of the telescope could have been developed in two steps:

 4.1 Reason analogically from magnification in surveying instruments (based on
 reflection in mirrors) to magnification in telescopes (based on refraction
 through lenses); and,

 4.2 Assume Delia Porta's discussion which offers a quantitative analysis of both

 reflection and refraction by which the burning point of spherical mirrors as

 well as lenses can be computed and apply to refraction in sets of lenses.

 We begin (Sect. 2) with a brief account of the method used for measuring magnitudes

 of remote objects, and the theory of the military compass published by Galileo in 1606
 (this discussion corresponds to step 4.1, above). We continue (Sect. 3) with a study
 of Delia Porta's De refractione optices parte of 1593 (this discussion corresponds to
 step 4.2, above). We then propose (Sect. 4) a solution to the question, How Galileo
 could theorize about the telescope?

 2 Theory and application of surveying instruments

 The application of Euclid's optics to surveying instruments is well known.13 The
 governing rules of these instruments are based upon two elements:

 1. The line of sight of the visual ray marks a reference point on the remote objects;
 2. Geometrical elements, such as lines, arcs, and triangles, mediate between the

 object and the observer.

 To get a sense of the application and computation carried out with these instruments,

 let us examine the following example (Fig. 1): while a remote object AB subtends
 angle a at point E, an object, KO, of the same height, placed nearer at distance OE,
 subtends a greater angle b at E. Object KO is seen by the eye placed at E, and is larger

 '•* For the history of Greek and Roman surveying instruments, see Lewis (2004). Methods for measur
 ing heights using a mirror are described in many manuscripts on perspective, cosmography, and practical
 geometry, published throughout the Middle Ages and early Renaissance: see Smith, A. Mark (2001a, 2:
 448^57, 475-493; 1996, pp. 15-17, 90-98), Frangenberg (1992), Brownson (1981, pp. 181-188), Kemp
 (1978), Unguru (1977, pp. 22^10), Lindberg (1972, pp. 50-59, 118-135, 207-213), and Burton (1945, pp.
 357-361).

 than object AB. If a flat mirror is placed now at E and the eye is moved further away
 from E to point H, it is straightforward that, as long as angles b and b' remain equal,
 the manipulation of the parameters OE, EM, and HM determines the visual angle
 subtended at the eye. The height of object KO is correlated to the other parameters by

 the proportionality, KO/EO = HM/EM. Thus, the apparent magnitude of object KO is
 changed in relation to the apparent magnitude of object AB.

 It is important to note that plane mirrors, used in these instruments, form virtual

 images. The observer sees the image of an object positioned "behind" the mirror,
 because he or she interpolates the visual rays backward along straight lines to the
 point of origin. The apparent size of an object is measured by the apparent angle it
 subtends at the point of observation.14

 Instruments of greater or lesser sophistication were based on these elements:

 Heron's Dioptra, Ptolemy's Parallactic Quadrant, Levi Ben Gerson's the Jacob Staff,
 Egnatio Danti's Torqvetto Astronomico, Tycho Braha's Quadrant, and Galileo's Mil
 itary Compass.

 2.1 Galileo's Military Compass (1606): optics and instruments

 Galileo built the Geometric and Military Compass to be used as a mechanical com
 puting device, an elevation gauge, and for topographical survey.15 To get a sense of
 Galileo's instrument, we follow an example of its operations as described by Galileo

 himself. Of special importance for our argument is how the change of distances and

 manipulation of angles of vision made an observed object to be perceived in different

 apparent angles, thus affecting its apparent magnitude. One can measure the height of

 an object by raising or lowering the place where the instrument is located (Fig. 2):

 Wishing to measure height AB, hold the Instrument at some place above the
 ground, as at point F, and sight at point A along side EF, noting the graduations
 between G and I as cut by the thread to be, say, 65. Then, going down and being

 vertically under point F, say at point C, we sight the same height along side DC,

 noting the graduations between L and O, which will be more than before, as say
 70. Then, take the difference between those numbers 65 and 70, which is 5, and

 as many times as this is contained in the larger number (that is, in 70, which will

 tradition of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as well as his experimental pursuits, see Pitt (1992,
 pp. 4-8, 110-138), Settle (1996, pp. 27-28; 1968, pp. 121-126), Bedini (1994, Chap. 1, pp. 256-292,

 (2010, pp. xi-xxii, 27-41, 193-207), Lefevre (2001, pp. 11-27),and Drake(1999a, pp. 106-125; 1999b).

 which latter we shall measure, as we can easily do, and thus we shall come to
 know the height of AB.16

 With this set of instructions, Galileo shows how a certain height can be measured from

 a distance by taking two angle readings on a vertical, parallel to the height in question.
 Galileo demonstrated how linear magnitudes (i.e., distances, heights, widths, and

 breadths) of remote objects could be obtained by applying the rules of measurement
 by sighting,17 using an optical device such as the military compass in its capacity as a

 quadrant.18 The compass enables the surveyor to measure the apparent angle created
 between visual rays (lines of sight) reaching the object. The reading of the measured
 angles is obtained by marking points denoted by the plumb-line on the graduation
 scale of the instrument. This measuring tool correlates linear magnitudes with angles;

 thus, by taking two different measurements of the objects, that is, by measuring two

 different apparent angles of the same object, the surveyor can compute a certain linear

 magnitude of the remote object. Clearly, the purpose of the instrument is to overcome

 spatial difficulties, such as the inaccessibility of the object.

 Note that the instrument can be manipulated in reverse, that is, in the opposite direc

 tion of the original design. In this setup, the geometrical correlation between linear
 magnitudes and apparent angles is purely logical and so the relation may be main
 tained irrespective of causal considerations. Now, when one inserts a mirror into the
 instrument,19 by Euclid's Optics, Prop. 19, the correlation between the linear magni

 tude and the apparent angle is mediated with the mirror via the virtual image (reflected
 in the mirror). Because the law of reflection is reflexive, it creates reciprocal relations

 between, on one hand, the distances of the object and the surveyor from the mirror and,

 pass. He was, however, well familiar with the optical features and capacities of various arrangements of
 mirrors, see Valleriani (2010, pp. 60-66) and Dupre (2005).

 on the other, the heights of the observer's eye and that of the object. Thus, angles and
 magnitudes of visible objects could be manipulated via the interface of a flat mirror
 by changing its location.

 3 Delia Porta's De refractione optices parte (1593): quantitative analyses of

 reflection and refraction

 3.1 Theory

 In Book II of De refractione, Delia Porta discusses reflection and refraction of solar
 rays in spherical interfaces.20 He stated in the Preface that "... refraction through a

 sphere is reciprocal to, and in agreement with, reflection from a concave mirror...."21

 Here, we have a powerful claim concerning the relation between refraction and reflec
 tion. The reciprocal relation between refraction and reflection played a fundamen
 tal role in Delia Porta's theory of refraction, and he proceeded—as we will see—to
 illustrate the theorems experimentally. He was not content with a purely theoretical,

 that is, geometrical, analysis of refraction and augmented the analysis with optical
 illustrations.

 In this analysis, Delia Porta builds on Euclid's Elements, Bk. IV, in which the geo
 metrical properties of polygons inscribed in a circle are discussed. Delia Porta begins
 the discussion: Let DABC (Fig. 3a) be a concave spherical mirror to which a ray of
 the Sun AB, parallel to the diameter CED, incident at B, and arc BC equals to one
 sixth of the circle circumference. The connected lines BC, CE, and EB form a triangle
 BCE in which angles CEB, EBC, and BCE are equal and the alternate angles CEB and
 ABE are also equal. Since the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection,
 the incident angle ABE is equal to the angle of reflection CBE, and line BC is the path
 of the reflected ray. Therefore, in a spherical concave mirror, when a ray of the Sun,

 AB strikes along the chord of a hexagon, it is reflected toward the diameter DC at its
 lower terminus to point C.22

 Delia Porta continues: In a spherical concave mirror (Fig. 3b), when a ray of the

 Sun strikes along the chord of an octagon, the angle of incidence ABD is equal to
 the angle of reflection DBE, and the reflected ray BE intersects the diameter of the
 mirror's sphere perpendicularly; in a spherical concave mirror (Fig. 3c), when a ray of
 the Sun strikes along the chord of a dodecagon, the angle of incidence ABD is equal

 to the angle of reflection DBE, and the reflected ray BE intersects the diameter of the

 mirror at point E.23

 On the basis of these relations, Delia Porta inferred the following propositions: the

 angle of reflection, made by a hexagon (Fig. 3a, six-sided polygon) is 60°; the angle

 20 Note that the cone of rays issued from each point source of the Sun (i.e., an infinite object) will become
 parallel at the point of incident. On focal points and planes, and the location, size, and orientation of an
 image produced by a lens, see Hecht (1990, pp. 139-145) and Smith, A. Mark (2010b, 1: xciii-xcvii).

 Fig. 3 Reflection in hexagon, octagon, and dodecagon

 of reflection made by an octagon (Fig. 3b, eight-sided polygon) is 45°; the angle of
 reflection made by a dodecagon (Fig. 3c, 12-sided polygon) is 30°; the angle of reflec
 tion made by hexdecagon (Fig. 4a, 16-sided polygon) is 22.5°; and so the angles of
 reflection are getting more acute as the rays strike the spherical concave mirror nearer

 to the diameter. Hence, the point of reflection for each ray, respectively, is located
 along the diameter CE from the terminus at E (Fig. 4a), up to a point placed at one
 quarter of the mirror's diameter, where the burning point of the mirror is located.24

 Delia Porta noted that by placing the burning point, that is, the focal point of the
 mirror, at one quarter of its diameter, he corrected Euclid's long standing error in
 Catoptrica, where the burning point of a concave spherical mirror was placed at the
 center of the mirror's diameter.25

 Delia Porta now traced the reflection when ray AB strikes above the chord of a
 hexagon (Fig. 4b) at a height equal to a chord of a pentagon; the angle of incidence
 ABD is equal to the angle of reflection DBF. The path of the reflected ray BF falls
 beyond the diameter CDE, further than E, to the point of reflection F outside the
 spherical concave mirror.

 Delia Porta concluded the discussion of reflection with a general proposition for the

 relation between the point of incidence, namely, the point where the ray is reflected,

 and the point of reflection, the point where the reflected ray intersects with the optical
 axis of the system (in this case, a spherical concave mirror). Let EBAC (Fig. 5a) be

 Fig. 6 Refraction in hexagon, octagon, dodecagon, and hexdecagon

 of the incident ray denoted by its chord, (2) the angle of reflection, and (3) the radius

 of the mirror, could be calculated. Accordingly, the focal length of a concave spherical

 mirror could be determined in terms of the radius of the spherical mirror.

 Thus far is Delia Porta's analysis of reflection. Given the fundamental assumption

 of reciprocity, he now conducts the same analysis, applied to refraction. When ray BH

 (Fig. 6a) strikes at a height defined by a chord of a hexdecagon (16-sided polygon)
 the angle of reflection in a spherical concave mirror is 22.5°. The ray ascends toward
 the region of the semi-diameter to point X (Fig. 6b) placed between the terminus and
 a quarter of the radius of the sphere. Given that the path of the refracted ray and the

 distance of its point of refraction from the terminus P is reciprocally equal to the path
 and distance of the reflected ray, the refracted ray proceeds to an opposite direction
 along the optical axis below the sphere. Delia Porta, therefore, marked the point of
 refraction at S, external to the sphere, where XP = PS.

 For another example, ray CI (Fig. 6a) strikes at a height defined by a chord of
 a dodecagon (12-sided polygon) and the angle of reflection in a spherical concave
 mirror is 30°. In reflection, the ray ascends toward the region of the semi-diameter to

 point Z (Fig. 6b). Delia Porta, therefore, marked the point of refraction at R, external
 to the sphere, where ZP = PR.28 The same geometrical construction defines all the

 other points of refraction, Q and P. The path of the refracted rays is inscribed as a line

 connecting the points of incidence at the front surface of the sphere to the points of

 2S Delia Porta (1593, pp. 42^13): "Radium CI, & erit punctus I, latus dodecagoni, scilicet latus GI, dim

 nam quantum in concauo speculo supra diametri calcem [i.e., point P] feriebat in semidiametro, tantum hie
 infra extra diametrum desendet."

 refraction, that is (Fig. 6a), H'S for the ray incident at 22.5°, I'R for the ray incident

 at 30°, L'Q for the ray incident at 45°, and M'P for the ray incident at 60°.

 Delia Porta applies this geometrical construction to tracing the path of the rays of
 the Sun through a sphere (Fig. I).29 The ray AGVPT passes through the center of the

 sphere to infinity without being refracted, and its path marks the optical axis to serve
 as a reference line. Next, he traces the ray passing through E, striking at M. GM is a
 chord of a hexagon (six-sided polygon), thus the ray EM advances toward the terminus
 at P, forming line MP. Then, he traced ray CI, where point I is made by a chord of
 a dodecagon (12-sided polygon), which is refracted outside the diameter to point R.
 Then, he traced ray DL, where point L is made by a chord of an octagon (eight-sided
 polygon), which is refracted outside the diameter to point Q. Ray BH, where point H
 is made by a chord of a hexdecagon (16-sided polygon), is refracted outside of the
 diameter to point S. Ray FN, where point N is made by a chord of a pentagon, thus

 refracted inside the sphere to point O, above the terminus at point P. The geometrical
 construction which defines points of refraction is governed, according to Delia Porta,
 by the following rule:

 [the path of the rays] is inverted to what is said for a spherical concave mirror.
 Where rays [of the Sun] ascend in a spherical concave mirror, here [in a glass
 sphere] they descend and vice versa. Only when the rays strike a point made by

 the terminus, [thus meeting at P].30

 For a given point of incidence, the distance between the terminus and the point where

 the reflected and refracted ray intersects the optical axis is the same, but the ray pro
 ceeds in opposite directions with respect to the optical interface. Once this relation
 between reflection and refraction is established, Delia Porta could calculate the geo

 metrical properties of an optical interface, whether it is a mirror or a sphere. The path

 of the rays is determined in terms of the height of the incident ray denoted by its chord,

 the angle of reflection/refraction, and the radius curvature of the interface. The result

 is the point at which the ray converges or diverges in relation to the optical axis of the
 interface.

 3.2 Experimental illustrations

 To illustrate his theoretical claims, Delia Porta procured a transparent block made
 of well polished glass, a foot length, a foot width, and a finger breadth (Fig. 8). He
 cut out a slice of half a sphere of the surface of the block so it could be used as a
 refractive interface. On the top of the device, Delia Porta placed an opaque plate with
 holes through which rays could pass and penetrate the device. Then, by tracing and

 inscribing on the side of the glass block the perceived path of the rays traversing the
 device he could actually see correlations between his geometrical construction and the

 actual path of the rays.31

 To ease the adverse effects caused by the poor quality of the glass, Delia Porta used

 spheres made of crystal glass (pila crystallina) which was considered much purer than
 the common glass used for lens making at the time. In Bk. II, Props. 22 and 23, he
 presented an analysis of the rays traversing through the spheres and added a figure to

 30 Delia Porta (1593, p. 43): "Sed haec irregularitas hanc habet regulam, vt contraria sint ijs, quae de spe

 clarify the argument (Fig. 9).32 Modern optical simulations of the path of the rays BI

 and FI, incident at 60° into a glass sphere, suggest that the rays could only refract to

 point I, at the terminus of the sphere, that is, if Delia Porta had used crystal glass of
 index of refraction of 1.732.33

 When Delia Porta made his experiments with spherical concave and convex inter
 faces, he also used elements made of common glass (superficiem vitream conuexam).34

 For comparison, the indices of refraction of the glass used by Galileo in his telescopes

 and spectacle lenses at the time varied between 1.512 and 1.546,35 while the range of
 crystal (lead) glass's indices of refraction varied between 1.6 and 1.82.

 To execute his measurements, Delia Porta had to collimate the device. He lifted the

 board so that the ray could traverse the hole at E (Fig. 10). Delia Porta used the same

 device for determining the place to which the rays of the Sun are refracting through

 spherical concave surface. In the same manner, he prepared a small glass board a foot
 length, half a foot width, and a finger breadth. Next, he placed on top of the glass a

 thin opaque board made of copper (or wood), equal in length and width to the original
 device, and in it he bored small, round holes to let the rays of the Sun travel through

 them. Then, he raised the device from the floor so the rays could pass through it, while
 the observer looks at them from the side.36

 Delia Porta used the device for tracing the path of solar rays refracting through

 a spherical concave interface, that is, a plano-concave interface (Fig. II).37 In his
 graphical report, Delia Porta drew the path of the ray DI incident at 22.5°, ray CH
 incident at 30°, ray BG' incident at 45°, and ray AF incident at 60°.38

 Consider the path of ray AF incident at 60°, at the height of six-sided polygon:

 T so angle TFS is equal to angle SFR. Ray BG' is incident at 45°, at the height of
 eight-sided polygon. Passing through the glass, along a straight line, another ray is
 refracted at G' toward point Q so angle QG'P is equal to angle PG'O. Ray CH incident
 at 30°, at the height of 12-sided polygon. Passing through the glass, along a straight
 line, the ray is refracted at H toward point N' so angle N'HM is equal to angle MHL.
 Ray DI is incident at 22.5°, at the height of 16-sided polygon. Passing through the
 glass, along a straight line, the ray is refracted at point I toward point N so the angle
 NIK is equal to angle KIG. Delia Porta noted that rays BG' and AF will not refract
 toward points Q and T. We know that the reason for this is that rays BG' and AF are
 incident at points G' and F in an angle greater than the critical angle of 48.5°.

 Points N and N' (Fig. 11), which Delia Porta marked in his observational report,
 can also be determined according to the geometrical approximation he had developed

 (i.e., the discussion related to Fig. 6). Being incident at 22.5° (Fig. 12a), at the height
 of a chord of 16-sided polygon, ray DI is refracted toward point N. X is the point to
 which ray IK is reflected by a spherical concave mirror QKR, intersecting the optical

 axis LR. Thus, point G is determined by the extension of the distance XR to the other
 side of the interface QKR, that is, XR = RG. Since a ray refracted through a concave

 interface will bend outside of the optical axis, the path of the refracted ray will follow

 line IN, forming equal angles NIK = KIG. The same is with ray CH incident at 30°

 Fig. 11 Refraction through a plano-concave interface

 (Fig. 12b), at the height of a chord of 12-sided polygon. Ray CH is refracted toward
 point N'. Point Z is the point to which ray HM is reflected by a spherical concave
 mirror QMR, intersecting the optical axis L'R. Thus, point L is determined by the
 extension of the distance ZR to the other side of the interface QMR, that is, ZR = RL.

 Since a ray refracted through a concave interface will bend outside of the optical axis,

 the path of the refracted ray will follow line HN', forming equal angles MHL = MHN'.
 Note that the slope angle of the diverging ray IN (Fig. 12a) is the same as slope angle

 IG, but they proceed to different directions. This holds for the slope angles of ray CH
 (Fig. 12b), that is, the diverging slope angle HN' and the converging slope angle HL.
 However, since the distance RG (Fig. 12a), is larger than the distance RL (Fig. 12b),
 the slope angle of ray CH (Fig. 12b) is less acute than the corresponding slope angle
 of ray DI (Fig. 12a).

 Delia Porta then accounted for the path of the solar rays refracting through a spher

 ical convex interface, that is, a plano-convex interface (Fig. 13).39 He drew the path

 of ray DI incident at 22.5°, ray CH incident at 30°, ray BG incident at 45°, and ray AF
 incident at 60° at the height of six-sided polygon. To trace the path of the converging

 rays, Delia Porta applied the slope angles of the corresponding rays refracted by the

 F toward point Q so angle QFM is equal to angle MFR. In this case, the refracted ray
 will not advance toward point R because the angle of incidence is above the critical

 through the glass along a straight line, and is refracted at G toward point S so angle

 point I toward point V, so angle VIP is equal to angle PIZ.

 3.3 Application

 Delia Porta's theory of refraction delineates a quantitative scheme for tracing rays inci

 dent at various angles to optical interfaces. In particular, rays with angles of incidence
 below the chord of 16-sided polygon (22.5°). Excluding considerations of image for
 mation and visual perception, Delia Porta developed a geometrical method by which
 one can define a point (punctus refractionis) where the refracted rays meet the optical

 Ray BG will not advance toward point X since the incident angle at point G is above the critical angle

 of 48.5°. Delia Porta acknowledged this constraint (1593, Bk II, Prop. 4, p. 46).

 axis of the interface. This was the only available quantitative theory of refraction at
 the time. It was a theory which skilled opticians, using a straightedge, compass, and
 table of chords,could easily apply in their practice.41

 Delia Porta's practice was based on a systematic tracing technique for illustrating

 the path of the refracted rays in terms of their directions and the angles by which they

 converge or diverge. Given reciprocity between reflection and refraction, Delia Porta
 extended the focal length of the reflected rays to the other side of the interface, and

 marked the point of refraction (i.e., the burning point). Delia Porta applied the same
 slope angles of the rays to concave and convex interfaces. For example, the diverging
 slope angle of ray DI (Fig. 12a), that is slope angles IN = IG, were applied to the cor
 responding ray DI (Fig. 13) incident at the convex interface and refracted along slope
 angle IZ (Fig. 13). From Delia Porta's geometrical scheme one could infer the dis
 tances LG (Fig. 12a) and LZ (Fig. 13), in terms of the radius curvature of the interface.

 Accordingly, the distance LG (Fig. 12a), from the back surface of the plano-concave
 interface and the distance LZ (Fig. 13), from the back surface of the plano-convex
 interface, for angles incident below the chord of 16-sided polygon, would be about 2.4
 times the radius curvature. This technique of ray tracing suggests an approximation

 by which a ratio of about 2.4 exists between the radius curvature and the distance of
 the burning points of plano-concave and plano-convex interfaces.

 Essentially, Delia Porta's theory of refraction makes the following claims: For a
 given incident ray, (1) the larger the radius of an optical interface was, the further
 away the converging/diverging ray would intersect the optical axis from the optical

 interface; and (2) the larger the radius of an optical interface was, the smaller the angle
 of refraction would be. Accordingly, one could mark a point {punctus refractionis)
 along the optical axis, identified with what we define today as the focal point of an

 optical interface.

 4 A proposed solution

 We conjecture that Galileo ingeniously combined two distinct optical theories which

 together offer insight into the working of the telescope. We claim that Galileo could

 link Delia Porta's quantitative theory of reflection and refraction with the Euclidean
 optical theory of surveying instruments. Galileo could consider magnification in sur

 veying instruments, based on reflection, an analogue for telescopic magnification. He

 could rely on Delia Porta's theory to secure, first, a faithful relation between reflection

 and refraction and, second, an algorithm for determining lens specifications for optical

 properties required for improving magnification. Galileo stated in Sidereus nuncius

 that he improved the telescope on the basis of his knowledge of refraction (doctrinae de
 refractionibus)42 It stands to reason that Galileo was familiar with Delia Porta's opti
 cal works since he had them in his private library.43 Galileo could apply Delia Porta's

 theory of refraction which develops the essential quantitative geometrical relations by
 which the properties of optical elements are determined:

 1. The relation between the radius of curvature and the angle of reflection/refraction

 of the incident ray; and,

 2. The relation between the radius of curvature and the point at which the

 reflected/refracted rays intersect with the optical axis.

 These are elements of a theory by which specifications of lenses can be calculated and

 produced accordingly.44

 Here is the plausibility argument we put forward: Galileo knew about the spyglass;

 an instrument made of a tube and two lenses of which the one facing the object is con

 vex, and the other, closest to the eye, is concave. From his experience with surveying

 instruments (i.e., his military compass), Galileo knew how to manipulate images of
 remote objects with the goal of calculating the heights of the objects. Similarly, the

 42 Galileo ([1610] 1989, p. 37) and Favaro (1890-1909, 3: 60): "Per quae ad consimilis Organi inventio
 nem devenirem, me totum converterem; quam paulo post, doctrinae de refractionibus innixus, assequutus
 sum."

 spyglass is an instrument that manipulates images of remote objects with the goal of
 seeing them closer. Could there be analogical reasoning that would help in clarifying

 the functioning of the spyglass, and turn it into a scientific instrument?

 The rules of measurement by sighting, applied by Galileo for the operation of
 his military compass, correlate linear magnitudes with apparent angles. These rules

 offered Galileo a method for manipulating images of objects, and he could thus draw
 an analogy between the following two procedures. In the case of surveying instru

 ments, one looks at an image formed with a flat mirror by reflection, while in the case

 of the spyglass, one looks through a lens at an image which is formed with another lens

 by refraction. Galileo could regard the procedure by which an observer OL (Fig. 14a),
 looks at the image, I', of object AB reflected by the plane mirror located at E, as

 analogical to the procedure of looking through lens GM at the image, I, of object AB
 (Fig. 14b), formed by lens CD.

 The apparent magnitude of reflected image I' (Fig. 14a) of object AB, is deter
 mined by the visual angle OI'L subtended at the eye of observer OL. Now, shortening
 the distance of the mirror from object AB, that is, EZ, will result in increasing angle

 AI'B. Given that the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are equal, the angle

 OI'L will increase too by the same amount. To maintain the line of sight between the

 observer's eye and the top of the image of object AB, the observer will have to come

 closer to the mirror, thus shortening KE. Greater visual angles, AI'B and OI'L, yield

 greater apparent magnitude of the image of object AB making it to be seen closer and
 larger. The relation between triangles ABI' and I'OL (Fig. 14a) could be suggestive for
 the spyglass. Compare image I' with an image I, formed by a lens CD (Fig. 14b) at a
 distance DE. Assuming Delia Porta's quantitative analysis of refraction, as long as the
 angles of incidence are below 22.5°, one can proceed safely by replacing refraction
 with reflection.

 In the setup of lenses CD and GM (Fig. 14b), the apparent size of image I of object

 AB is determined by the geometrical relations of triangle A'B'I. Image I is now con
 sidered an object at which the observer looks through lens GM, and thus a second
 triangle is formed, namely, IHQ. Note that these triangles are formed by each lens
 independently, according to its respective optical properties (i.e., convex lens con
 verges the rays and form a united cone while concave lens diverges the rays and form
 an inverted cone).45 The parameters of triangles A'B'I and IHQ could be therefore
 manipulated separately. Sharing the same optical axis and a mutual conjugate point
 at E, any change of the triangles' sides B'l and IQ will affect, respectively, the angles
 A'lB' and HIQ. Analogical to the case of surveying instruments where enlarging angle
 OI'L subtends image I' under a greater angle at the eye, in the case of the spyglass

 angle HIQ, enlarged by lens GM in relation to angle A'lB', subtends image I under a

 greater angle at the eye.

 Galileo could thus analyze the working of the spyglass in the following way. The
 observer looks through the spyglass at a distant object AB (Fig. 14b); its image, I,

 is formed by lens CD at distance DE. Looking at image I from a short distance, that

 45 In 1623, in The Assayer, Galileo states for the first time the different functioning of the lenses—the
 convex objective and the concave eyepiece: See Favaro (1890-1909, 6: 255) and Galileo ([1623] 1960, p.
 209).

 is, through a shorter lens GM, placed at distance ME from the image I, yields two
 different angles. Angle, a (A'lB'), produced by the longer lens CD, which is smaller
 than visual angle, b' (HIQ), produced by the shorter lens GM. Presupposing Delia
 Porta's claim regarding the reciprocal relation between the angle of reflection and that

 of refraction, image I of object AB, is presented to the eye at TP, under angle b which
 is equal to angle b' subtended at the eye by lens GM.46 Thus, the apparent size of
 a distant object, seen through a combination of two lenses of different "lengths," is
 enlarged, because angle b', subtended at the eye by the shorter lens, is larger than
 angle a subtended by the object through the longer lens. In this way, the principle of
 magnification comes to fruition.

 This analysis could facilitate the turning of the spyglass into a scientific instru

 ment—the telescope. Galileo could account for the path of refracted rays, passing
 through a system of lenses, and thus comprehend how the telescope enlarges the angle

 by which an object is represented to the eye. What remained for him to do is to realize
 the analysis with lenses cut to specification—a technological accomplishment on its
 own right. The calculation could be carried out by Delia Porta's approximation that a
 ratio of about 2.4 exists between the radius curvature and the distance of the burning

 point for plano-concave/convex interfaces.

 46 The height of TP (Fig. 14b) can be calculated for any given distance from M. This geometrical insight
 underpins the principle of the micrometer, the device later used by Galileo to measure apparent diameters
 and angular distances between the stars: see Drake and Kowal (1980).

 4.1 A calculation

 It is instructive to follow in detail the procedure of design and determination of the
 optical features and properties of a telescope like the one attributed to Galileo that
 magnifies 14 times. It is composed of a nearly plano-convex objective and a plano
 concave eyepiece, and has an entrance pupil diameter of 26 mm. It is evident that the
 smallest radius curvature of the eyepiece of this telescope is about 50 mm. Therefore,

 our design will not include an eyepiece of radius curvature less than 50 mm.

 For a given object at infinity (e.g., the Moon), which subtends an apparent angle of
 30',47 we obtain the chord of this angle related to a radius of 60 units of a reference
 circle:48

 Ch 0.5° = 2R ■ sin 72 = 120 ■ sin°'5/2 = 120 • 0.004363 = 0.523

 To see the Moon enlarged 14 times one has to obtain a visual angle of:

 0.5° • 14 = 7°

 The chord of this angle related to a radius of 60 units is obtained by:

 Ch 7° = 2R ■ sin 72 = 120 • sin7/2 = 120 • 0.061 = 7.32

 Consequently, magnification can be also expressed by the ratio of chords:

 M — ch7/ cho.5 = 7'32/o.523 = 13.996

 Under these terms, the reciprocal sine of a visual angle subtended at the eye by a
 circle/diameter/object is inversely proportional to its distance. Accordingly, one can
 compute the distance (i.e., radius of an arc/circle) according to the sine of the subtended
 angle. Thus we obtain

 Radius curvature of the long lens is, '/sin 0.5:2= 1/0.00436 = 229.36 units, and
 Radius curvature of the short lens is, '/sin7:2 = 1/0.061 = 16.38 units.

 Applying Delia Porta's approximation, the focal point of a plano-convex/concave lens
 is located at a distance equal to 2.4 of its radius curvature. Consequently,

 The focal point of the long lens is 229.36 • 2.4 ^ 550 units, and

 The focal point of the short lens is 16.38 • 2.4 = 39.3 units.

 Accordingly, the magnification of this design is 550:39.3 = 14.

 Recall that we are limited to using an eyepiece of less than 50 units of radius cur
 vature. Assuming radius curvature of 50 mm for the eyepiece, one has to obtain the

 47 For a reference, a tower of 52 m height located at a distance of 6000 m from an observer, subtends an
 angle of ~30'.

 The first column, SURFACE, denotes the surfaces of the optical system. Line
 1 refers to the front surface of the objective, and line 2 refers to its back sur

 face, while lines 3 and 4 refer to the front and back surfaces of the eyepiece,
 respectively. The second column, RADIUS CURVATURE, displays the radius
 of each surface of the lenses. The third column, THICKNESS, lines 1 and 3, dis

 play the central thickness of the lenses, and line 2 displays the distance between

 the lenses after optimization, while line 4 displays the distance of the eye from
 the last surface of the eyepiece. The columns, RADIUS LENS and GLASS,
 display the radius of the lenses and the material through which the rays travel,
 respectively. BK7 is a common material for optical components and windows
 made of borosilicate glass with the following specifications: refractive index,
 n = 1.5168, and dispersion value, V = 64.17

 We obtained a Galilean telescope that magnify 13.76 times and its overall lens length
 is 1232.2 mm. As shown, our design and the ensuing computation rest only on optical
 magnification and the approximation derived from Delia Porta's theory of refraction.
 Considerations related to image formation, visual perception, or derivations of the
 sine law of refraction were not relevant in this design process, nor an aperture stop

 of less than 26 mm is required for improving the resolving power of the telescope.
 All these elements, theoretical and practical, were available to Galileo. He could put

 them together and transform thereby the Dutch spyglass into a scientific instrument.

 He did, but he did not divulge his scheme.

 The available theories of light and vision at the time Galileo obtained the Dutch inven

 tion, failed to provide the knowledge required for improving the performance of the

 telescope.49 A change of theory was needed. We have argued that it came with the

 Magnification: how to turn a spyglass into an astronomical telescope 461

 quantitative calculations of refraction put forward by Delia Porta in his De refracti
 one. We have suggested a plausibility argument; Galileo could appeal to analogical
 reasoning that, formally, the geometry of magnification in surveying instruments is
 the same as that in the telescope. He could then use Delia Porta's theory to render the
 transition from reflection to refraction reliable.

 It takes a towering figure to appreciate what Galileo had accomplished. Kepler too

 was a great theoretician who made his own instruments.50 It is not surprising that he

 was probably the only scientist at that time who, upon receiving a copy of Sidereus
 nuncius in April 1610, could understand precisely what Galileo had achieved:

 I am aware how great a difference there is between theoretical speculations and
 visual experience; between Ptolemy's discussion of the antipodes and Colum
 bus' discovery of the new world, and likewise between the widely distributed
 tubes with two lenses and the apparatus with which you, Galileo, have pierced
 the heavens. But here I am trying to induce the skeptical to have faith in your
 instrument.51

 To be sure, since this revolutionary time at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
 modern science has cultivated a good measure of faith in instruments, but we are still

 not entirely clear how Galileo transformed the spyglass into the astronomical telescope.

 This paper offers a new perspective on Galileo's dramatic accomplishment—turning
 a toy into a scientific instrument.
