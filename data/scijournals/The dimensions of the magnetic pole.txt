 The dimensions of the magnetic pole: a controversy at
 the heart of early dimensional analysis

 Abstract The rise of dimensional analysis in the latter part of the nineteenth century

 occurred largely in the context of electromagnetism. It soon appeared that the subject,

 albeit seemingly straightforward, was in fact wrought with difficulties. These revealed

 deep conceptual issues regarding the character of physical quantities. Usually, whether

 or not these problems actually constituted inconsistencies was itself a matter of debate.

 In one instance, however, regarding the electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic pole,

 all protagonists agreed that the matter required attention. A controversy ensued in 1882.

 Its resolution partly relied on the realization that it arose from differences between the

 scientific cultures prevalent on the Continent versus in Great Britain. These cultural

 differences concerned the possible relevance of the medium in which interactions

 involving magnetic poles take place, as well as the understanding of permeability in

 Ampere's model of magnetism. The controversy around the electrostatic dimensions

 of the magnetic pole entailed crucial issues that were soon to play just as central a

 part in a wider debate about the dimensions of electromagnetic quantities in different

 systems of units. Why the latter topic was never raised during the 1882 controversy

 provides insights into the early understanding of dimensional analysis.

 1 Introduction

 1.1 What is dimensional analysis

 S. G. de Clark

 Dimensional analysis is a method used in physics and engineering to investigate the

 relations between physical quantities. It first ascribes to the latter so-called dimen

 sions. These can then be compared, notably to ensure that physical equations obey the

 expected rule of "dimensional homogeneity." The key concept, i.e., "dimensions," is
 related to the concept of units, and indeed dimensional analysis in its modern sense

 arose out of a concern for conversions between different systems of units.

 Physics requires that units be defined for all physical quantities. However, all these

 units are not chosen independently from one another—hence the phrase "system of

 units." Indeed, some quantities are chosen whose units are deemed "fundamental" or

 "base units." All other physical quantities then see their units defined with reference
 to these fundamental ones, and for this reason, these are referred to as "derived units."

 For instance in the SI system, one of the base units is that of length: the meter.1

 The unit of area is then defined with reference to it as the square meter.

 Base quantities and their units are defined arbitrarily, primarily for reasons of con

 venience and accuracy. In our example, the meter is the distance that light travels in
 vacuum in a time interval of 1/299,792,458 s.2

 Derived units on the other hand are defined from base units by using physical laws

 that relate the corresponding physical quantities, or to be more precise the values that

 measure these physical quantities. To actually fix the definition of a derived unit can be

 more than a matter of formalism: because concerns for precision involve experimental

 considerations, it may require to have an actual setup in mind in which the physical
 law can be embodied.3 However, the relationship between a derived unit and the base

 units can be found simply by formal inspection of the chosen physical law. In our

 example, the area of a surface is given by squaring the length of the side of a square
 surface of the same size, i.e., area = length2, and the same goes for the units of these

 quantities: square meter = (meter)2.

 This is where dimensional analysis comes in. It assigns symbols to the fundamental

 units: notably, L represents the base unit of length, Τ that of time, and Μ that of mass.

 In practice, one would not write "square meter = (meter)2," but instead, using the

 1 SI stands for "Systeme International d'Unites." The others are the units of: time (the second), mass (the

 kilogram), temperature (the kelvin), electric current (the ampere), light intensity (the candela) and amount
 of substance (the mole).

 2 As if to highlight the arbitrary character of its definition, the meter went through several: originally, in
 1793, it was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's equator to its North Pole; then

 in 1889 it became the length of a prototype bar, and in 1960 the 11th "Conference G6n6rale des Poids et

 Mesures" (CGPM) redefined this as 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the emission line of krypton-86.
 The current definition has been in use since 1983, since it was decided at the 17th CGPM.

 3 For example, Wilhelm Weber defined the unit of e.m.f. as follows: "As an absolute unit of measure of

 electromotive force, may be understood that electromotive force which the unit of measure of the earth's

 magnetism exerts upon a closed conductor, if the latter is so turned that the area of its projection on a plane
 normal to the direction of the earth's magnetism increases or decreases during the unit of time by the unit

 of surface" (Weber and Wilhelm Eduard 1861, p. 227).

 language of dimensional analysis: [area] = L2, where the square brackets stand for

 "dimensions of." To take a somewhat less trivial example, the dimensions of force [F]
 would be derived from Newton's second law as follows. Newton's second law states:

 d2x
 F = m χ —T
 di2

 where F stands for the force on the object, m its mass, χ its position and t for time—all

 understood as the physical quantities themselves.4 The quantities on the right-hand
 side—which I conveniently chose to be base ones—have dimensions: [m] = M, [jc] =
 L, [/] = T.

 The dimensions of a derivative are the same as that of a normal ratio,5; therefore,

 the dimensions of force are [F] = MLT~2.

 Once the dimensions of all known quantities have been established in this way,
 dimensional analysis can be used as a check on derivations. Indeed all the terms that

 appear in an equation are required to be "(dimensionally) homogeneous," i.e., to have

 the same dimensions as one another.6 When a result is found by inspection to violate

 this rule, this signals that a mistake must have been made in the course of the derivation.

 This is systematically used as a first check on results, and it seems fair to say that it

 constitutes the most widespread use of dimensional analysis in physics today.7

 In anticipation of the issues that shall be raised below, it is important to point out

 how the relation between dimensions and systems of units is understood nowadays.

 Some common systems of units differ by their base units, yet share the same base

 quantities. For instance, the CGS system differs from the metric system in so far that

 it uses centimeters instead of meters and grams instead of kilograms as the base units

 of length and mass, respectively, but both systems use L, Τ and Μ as base quantities.

 The same is true for the systems of units between which one would typically have

 to convert in everyday life due to their being used to various degrees in different
 countries: SI (meter, km, kg...), imperial units and US customary units (foot, mile,

 pound..However, different systems of units can also have different base quantities.
 For instance, particle physics uses the so-called natural units, which use three base

 units (unit of length, the speed of light c and Planck's constant A), three fundamental

 definitions that enable us to relate these to units of length, time and mass,8 and only
 one dimension, L, because both c and A are considered dimensionless.9

 4 That is, a numerical value and the unit, such as "4 kg".

 5 That is, taking a single derivative with respect to a quantity yields the same dimensions as dividing by it,

 and taking the double derivative, the same dimensions as dividing by its square.

 6 Note that this is trivially the case in the examples given above: there are only two terms, one on each side
 of the equal sign, and both have the same dimensions.

 7 It is by no means the only one however. Notably, in quantum field theory dimensional analysis is used to
 determine what terms can rightfully appear in a theory. See footnote 8 below for more details.

 8 These relations are:

 - L = ct, where L is the distance traveled by a photon, t its time of travel and c the speed of light in vacuum.
 - Ε = hf, where Ε is the energy of a photon of frequency /, and h is Planck's constant.

 - Ε = mc2, where £ is the energy of a particle of mass m (and c still the speed of light).

 9 Both are also given the numerical value of 1. Since L = et, [Z-] = L implies [/] = L. Since Ε = hf

 S. G. de Clark

 As we shall see below, at the time of the controversy which is the topic of the present

 paper, two systems of units were in use in the field of electromagnetism. These had the

 same base quantities (L, Μ and T) and base units. The difference between them lay in

 how they obtained the units of derived quantities: some of the physical relations used

 for this purpose were not the same in the two systems, and the dimensions obtained

 for the derived quantities were not either.

 1.2 The emergence of dimensional analysis

 Dimensional analysis in its modern sense can be traced back to Jean Baptiste Joseph

 Fourier's Theorie analytique de la chaleur of 1822. Concern over homogeneity, in the

 sense of the conditions required for a relationship between physical quantities to be

 meaningful, had existed since Antiquity. For instance, quantities could only be added

 that were homogeneous, by which was meant, etymologically enough, "of the same

 nature," and Euclid stated something similar for ratios. These quantities were usually

 thought as geometrical—lines or surfaces (Euclid, book 5, lemma 3; see Mueller 1970,

 pp. 1-6). The introduction of derived quantities by Isaac Newton in the seventeenth

 century eventually led to a numerical conception of equations in the eighteenth century

 (see Macagno 1971, p. 392). With all terms and quantities now being pure numbers,

 the issue of homogeneity seemed a moot point.10 In the early nineteenth century,

 however, Fourier recast the issue into a different problematic. If terms represented

 numbers, then what remained of an equation when those numbers were altered by a

 change of units? Under what conditions would an equation remain true independently

 of the system of units considered? Fourier defined these conditions by means of the

 relationship between the conversion factors of the derived quantities and those of a set

 of basic quantities. Terms were homogeneous whose units had the same relationship

 to the base units (Fourier 1822, pp. 154-158).

 Fourier's work did not have an immediate impact, and in the following decades

 before dimensional analysis aroused interest, Wilhelm Eduard Weber introduced three

 systems of units in the context of electromagnetic theory. A same physical quantity

 usually had different dimensions in these different systems of units.

 As well as Carl Friedrich Gauss, Weber wished to define new, stable units for electric

 and magnetic quantities, and developed the notion of absolute measurement.11 The

 and / is as always given by inverse of a time, this in turn implies [E] = L . Ε = mc1 then implies

 [Μ] = [E] = L~1. Because particle physics deals more with energies than lengths, it has become customary

 to use Μ rather than L as the base quantity: [L\ = [t] = M-1.

 An important application of this is the following. The action, which is the time integral of an energy, is

 dimensionless: M~'M = M°. The Lagrangian density £ is related to the action 5 by: S = f d4xC, where

 the integral is over spacetime coordinates. Since both time and space have dimension M_I, each term in

 £ must have dimension M4. Taking a scalar theory as an example, that is, a theory where the field, φ, is a

 scalar quantity, one of these terms is y(d,<p)2, which implies that [ψ] — Μ. Knowing this puts constraints
 on what form the other terms in £ can take, i.e., what functions of the field they can be, since they all are

 required to have dimension M4.

 work of Gauss and Weber was based on the mechanist credo that the units of all

 physical quantities, notably electromagnetic ones, could be expressed in terms of the

 units of mechanical quantities. They regarded a few mechanical units as fundamental,

 i.e., length, time and mass, and from these they derived "absolute units" for electric

 and magnetic quantities.12 More specifically, Gauss was interested in defining an
 absolute unit for magnetic field intensity, and Weber for electrical resistance (Gauss
 1833; Weber 1851). This led Weber to define three different "systems of absolute

 units": the "electrostatic, "electromagnetic" and "electrodynamic" systems. The first

 two especially gained wide acceptance. They were notably described by James Clerk

 Maxwell in his famous Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (Maxwell 1873, Vol. 2,

 chapter 10).

 The defining difference between these two systems was that they were founded on

 different force laws—or equivalently different field laws. The electrostatic system of
 units was based on Coulomb's law for the force between electrostatic charges:

 / = (i)

 where e stands for charge, / for the force and r for the distance between the two

 charges. In terms of dimensions it implies:

 rl

 [el2

 if] = (2)

 where Τ was the electric field (Maxwell 1873, § 625). This would seem to first require

 finding the dimensions for the field in terms of L, Μ, T. Instead he substituted for [.F]

 of weights and measures. To this end, they enlisted the help of scientists, notably Gauss himself who in

 1836 was put in charge of such a program in Hanover. Defining new standards of measurement called

 for precision instruments, and also the respect of well-defined procedures, both when duplicating material

 standards and when actually making measurements. See notably Olesko (1995) and Olesko (1996).

 12 Gauss: original Carl Friedrich Gauss, Goettingue, 1833.
 See Weber (1851).

 13 See notably Everett (1879), chapters X and XI. An analogous description in terms of units rather than

 dimensions ran as follows: "In the electrostatic system the most important unit, which serves as the basis of

 all the others, is the unit of electricity. This is determined by the following definition: The unit of electricity

 is that amount of electricity which exerts the unit of force upon an equal amount of electricity at the unit of

 distance" (Clausius 1882, p. 383).

 and with [/] = LT~2M this yields:

 [es] = l3/2T_1M1/2, (3)

 where the subscript "s" refers to dimensions in the electrostatic system.13

 As will be discussed in greater detail in Sect. 2.1 below, Maxwell actually used the

 field rather than forces. His defining equation for the electrostatic system was:

 ^=4 (4)

 rz

 298

 and [e] relations in terms of T, L, M, e or T, L M, m, which held independently of the

 system concerned—notably in so far that their derivation did not require appealing to
 Coulomb's force laws.14

 In contrast the electromagnetic system was defined on the basis of Coulomb's law

 between magnetic poles:

 Ι = (5)

 rL

 where m stands for the strength of the pole, and again / for the force and r for

 the distance between the two poles. This relation was then in common use, on the

 same footing as its electrostatic counterpart. The concept of pole used at the time

 corresponded to a pole of an idealized magnet, i.e., uniformly magnetized throughout

 its length, and in the limit that this magnet becomes infinitely long and thin (so its

 ends become point-like).15 Equation 5 leads to the dimensional relation:

 [/]-$. (6)

 and with [/] = LT~2M this results in:

 [mm] = L3/2T-jM1/2, (7)

 where the subscript "m" stands for the electromagnetic system. Comparison with Eq. 3

 shows that Coulomb's law for magnetism yields the same dimensions for m in the

 electromagnetic system as its electrostatic counterpart does for e in the electrostatic

 one—as could indeed be expected from the structural similarity between the two
 laws.16

 Again, instead of the force law Maxwell actually used:

 K-£ (8)

 1882, p. 363)

 16 Again, this can be expressed in terms of units in the following way:

 "The unit of magnetism is that amount of magnetism which exerts upon an equal amount of magnetism at

 the unit of distance the unit of force." (Clausius 1882, p. 384)

 Clausius actually favored referring to this system as the "electrodynamic system," because he agreed with

 Ampere that magnetism arose from microscopic electric currents, hence was electrodynamic in nature, and

 consequently uses the subscript "d" instead of "m"; however, he made clear that it was standardly referred

 to as the electromagnetic system. (Clausius 1882, p. 383)

 17 What we would now call the auxiliary magnetic field.

 As for the electrodynamic system, it was based on Ampere's law between current elements (Weber 1851).

 as the basis of the electromagnetic system, where Η was the magnetic field (Maxwell
 1873, § 625; see Sect. 2.1 below).17

 14 He naturally attributed to r2 the dimensions L2.

 15 Maxwell (1873, Vol. 2, chapter 1, § 373). Magnetism was attributed to microscopic electric currents.

 In 1882 (the time when the controversy of interest took place) Lodge believed "universally accepted" that

 "the properties of magnetic substances of all kinds [were] explained by molecular electric currents, and no

 magnets or magnetic substances other than those consisting of current-conveying molecules exist." (Lodge

 299

 Until 1883, no one appears to have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that a

 quantity generally had different dimensions in different systems of units. However, a

 given physical quantity was expected to have a unique set of dimensions in any given

 system. In 1882, this requirement gave rise to a controversy regarding the dimensions

 of a magnetic pole. The debate took place mostly in Great Britain, in the Philosophical

 Magazine, sparked by a German publication by Rudolf Clausius in March 1882 soon

 translated in the British magazine (Clausius 1882).

 2 The electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic pole according to

 Maxwell and Clausius

 2.1 The dimensions of electromagnetic quantities in Maxwell's treatise on

 electricity and magnetism

 In order to appreciate the issues at stake, it is necessary to remember what the British

 viewpoint was at the time, as heralded by James Clerk Maxwell. And indeed it can

 fairly be said that Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (Maxwell 1873)

 had been responsible for sparking interest in dimensional analysis both in and beyond

 Great Britain: the Treatise had been very influential, and Maxwell had devoted an

 entire chapter of it to the topic (Maxwell 1873, Vol. 2, chapter 10). The importance

 he afforded dimensional analysis can be partly attributed to his general interest in the

 classification of physico-mathematical quantities (Darrigol 2000; Harman 1887), but

 it was also related, once again, to the prevalent concern for measurement standards.

 In fact, ten years earlier Maxwell had co-authored a contribution on the topic to the

 Committee on electrical standards that had been appointed by the British Association

 for the Advancement of Science with the view of establishing a standard of electric

 resistance.18 The wish to improve electromagnetic measurement standards was in turn

 strongly driven by the needs of cable telegraphy.19

 In his treatise, Maxwell focused on relations independent of any system of units. He

 gave fifteen dimensional relations deemed fundamental, either products of quantities

 that had the dimensions of energy (Eq. 9 below), energy density (Eq. 10),20 or ratios

 that led to especially simple dimensions in terms of the base units of time and length
 (T, L, L2, Eqs.11-13).21

 18 British Association for the Advancement of Science (1863).

 19 See notably, Hunt (1994, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2005) and Schaffer (1997) as well as Atten (1992) for the
 case of France.

 20 Energy and work have the same dimensions, as required by the work-energy theorem. Since work is

 given by force χ displacement, ithas dimensions: [work] = [force]xL = LT~2MxL = L2T_2M. Energy
 density then has dimensions: [energy density] = [energy] -h [volume] = L2T-2M L3 = L-1T-2M.

 21 Following the standard usage I shall use italics for quantities (for instance "e" for quantity of electricity),

 square brackets to denote the dimensions of a derived quantity (such as [e]) and no brackets, nor italics for

 the fundamental quantities in terms of which the dimensions are expressed (for instance "L" for length).
 (MaxweU 1873, Vol. 2, chapter 10, § 621-622.)

 with e the quantity of electricity; £ the line integral of electromotive intensity; m

 the quantity of magnetism; Ω the magnetic potential; ρ the electrokinetic momentum

 of a circuit; C the electric current; V the electric displacement; Τ the electromotive

 intensity; β the magnetic induction; Ή. the auxiliary magnetic field; C the strength of

 the current at a point; U the vector potential.

 Maxwell did not specify how he reached Eqs. 9 and 10. He appears to have simply

 deemed physically obvious that the products involved had dimensions of energy and

 energy density, respectively. He justified Eq. 11 by the fact that it involved the ratios of

 the time integral of quantities to the quantities themselves. For instance, the quantity

 of electricity e is the time integral of the electric current C. Dimensionally, integrating

 over a quantity entails multiplying by its dimensions, so:

 ΙτΗ  fCdt

 (14)

 Similarly Eqs. 12 and 13 were ratios of, respectively, line and surface integrals to the

 quantities themselves, thereby yielding dimensions of L and L2.

 Maxwell then used these fifteen relations in order to obtain the dimensions of the

 major electric and magnetic quantities. There was a problem however: although these

 relations only involved twelve quantities, they were not all independent, so that in fact

 another one would have been required in order to uniquely determine the dimensions

 of all twelve quantities in terms of L, Μ and Τ alone.

 To deal with this difficulty, Maxwell temporarily added a fourth base unit—or

 rather, a choice of two. He gave a list of dimensions in terms of L, Μ, Τ and the

 unit of static charge e, and another list in terms of L, Μ, Τ and the unit of magnetic

 pole m. Both these sets of dimensions were valid irrespective of the system of units

 considered—electrostatic or electromagnetic system notably.

 Of greatest import in Maxwell's derivation were [e], [m] and the electric field [F]

 for which he found, in terms of e and m, respectively:

 [m] = = m (15)

 (16)

 (17)

 Importantly, Maxwell did not explain how he obtained these dimensions from the

 fifteen dimensional relationships previously established, and this is the step for which

 disagreements were going to occur regarding the interpretation of his work.

 Furthermore, despite what Maxwell seemed to imply, the dimensions in terms of

 L, Τ, M, e and L, T, M, m of the various electromagnetic quantities that he provided

 cannot all be derived from the fifteen dimensional relations that he gives in the text.

 Some can be and even with far less than his fifteen relations. Notably, the first equality

 in Eq. 17 can be easily obtained from [eE] = ίγρ and = L (see Eqs. 9 and

 12, respectively), or alternatively from \DT\ = and [^] = L2 (see Eqs. 10 and

 13). However, in many cases, an additional relation is required. Crucially, this is true

 even for [m] = (Eq. 15) and [e] = Mji (Eq. 16). Either one can been obtained

 directly from the other, simply by solving for either e or m, respectively. However,

 neither can be derived using only the fifteen relations given by Maxwell.22

 For this reason, Clausius later argued that Maxwell used [/?] = [m]. This is con

 ceivable, for it does lead to all the dimensions Maxwell gave, and he indeed wrote

 it explicitly when listing them. However, the way he did so rather suggests that he

 had derived the dimensions of ρ and m independently and happened to find them the

 same.23 In contrast, Maxwell did provide an additional relation in the very section

 where he listed the main fifteen ones, although he only did so in a footnote and offered

 no clue regarding its origin: j = L.24 In combination with the others, this relation
 (as does [p] = [m])25 indeed yields all the dimensions that Maxwell gave, including

 [m\ = and [e] = Mji-. Using the relation j^j = L instead of [p] = [m]

 22 Neither can be the second equality in Eq. 17, [T\ = jj. See footnote 26 below.
 23 Indeed Maxwell wrote:

 Γ - τ

 (3) and (5) [ρ] = [m] = = [m],

 where the "(3)" and "(5)" refer to the numbering of m and p, respectively, when he listed earlier the

 electromagnetic quantities themselves. Furthermore, he never listed separately (i.e., on different lines)

 quantities that have the same dimensions. The situation occurs for only m and p, and C and Ω , and in both

 cases he presented the results the same way, i.e., again with:

 If [C] = [0] were to be also interpreted as a relation additional to the fifteen he gave explicitly, we would

 now have an abundance of riches, for either [p] = [m] or [C] = [0] is necessary to find all the dimensions,

 but not both (they do yield the same results).

 24 Neither Maxwell nor Clausius comments on why [p] should be equal to [m], either.

 25 And as does [C] = [Ω],

 however, even the simplest ways to get them require many more equations :

 In contrast, using [/?] = [m\ they can be obtained from:27

 L2M rni

 [eE] = -ψ-, I^J =T with [p] = [m]. (19)

 This probably explains why Clausius favored [ρ] = [m] as the relation most likely
 used by Maxwell.

 After listing the dimensions in terms of L, Τ, M, e and L, Τ, M, m of all the

 quantities of interest, Maxwell then derived their dimensions in the electrostatic and

 in the electromagnetic systems of units (hence in terms of L, Μ and Τ only) using either

 of these two lists. He obtained the electrostatic system of units by substituting in either

 list the electrostatic dimensions of the electric charge e and of the magnetic pole m—

 and similarly used their electromagnetic dimensions to get the electromagnetic system.

 The electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic pole thereby affected the electrostatic

 dimensions of all magnetic quantities, as the latter involved m.

 In turn, Maxwell defined the electrostatic dimensions of e and m by comparing the
 dimensions of the electric field obtained above to those obtained from Coulomb's law

 between electrostatic charges:28

 _ electrostatic charge _ e
 Τ = £ 7 =» [T] = (20)

 (distance from the charge) L

 Having obtained above [.Fj = ^ and [e] = Mji ,29 this yielded for the electrostatic

 dimensions of the magnetic pole: [m] = LI/'2M,/'2.

 30

 26 Again there are many other possible combinations, including another four that involve the same number

 of equations, with ^ j = L. The reason why using J = L as opposed to \ p\ = [m] demands the use

 of more equations for the derivation of the relation between e and m may be related to the fact that three

 of Maxwell's fifteen dimensional relations involve p, whereas only two contain U (both m and Β appear
 twice).

 The second equality in Eq. 17, [.F] = jj, can be derived equally simply with = L as with [ ρ) = [m]:

 [J-]=L[£] = T· with [p] = [m],

 or: [|] = L2, j = T, with [g] = L.

 27 There are many other possibilities, most more complicated. To give but one by way of example:

 WF1 = [£] = Τ, [E] = L, [|j] = L2 with [p] = [m].
 28 Analogously, the electromagnetic system was based on Coulomb's law for magnetism: Η — , where

 Η was the "magnetic force" on a magnetic pole of unit magnitude.

 Fig. 1 Equivalence of a current loop and a magnet

 2.2 The electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic pole according to Clausius

 Clausius too wished to find the dimensions of all major electric and magnetic quantities

 in both the electrostatic and electromagnetic systems of units. However, his derivation

 differed from Maxwell's and was somewhat more straightforward.

 Clausius first determined the dimensions of the electric charge in the electrostatic

 system and of the magnetic pole in the electromagnetic system, using the relevant
 Coulomb's law in each case, and attributing to force its usual mechanical dimensions,
 ML T"2. As discussed above, this led to the dimensions [es] = L /2T~1Μ1 /2 and
 [mm] = L3/2T_1M1/2, wherein the subscripts "s" and "m" refer to the electrostatic and

 electromagnetic systems, respectively—results that agreed with Maxwell's (Clausius
 1882, pp. 382-383).

 In order to find the dimensions of these quantities in the other system, i.e., [em] and
 [ras], Clausius reasoned that all that was needed was a relationship between e and m
 that held true in both systems of units. He appealed to Ampere's hypothesis that an
 electric current loop is equivalent to a magnet—equivalence that Maxwell endorsed,
 but which he had not used in his dimensional derivations. Clausius posited a plane
 circuit surrounding a surface of unit area, and a second surface of the same shape,

 parallel to the circuit, separated by an infinitesimal distance e. The two surfaces were
 deemed to contain the same amount of magnetism, north on the first and south on the

 second, thereby forming the magnet thought equivalent to the current loop (Clausius
 1882, pp. 382-383) (Fig. 1).

 For the magnetic sheets to produce forces of the same intensity as the current, the

 physical quantities involved had to satisfy the following relation:31

 magnitude of the magnetism on one sheet χ distance between the two sheets
 = magnitude of the current χ surface area enclosed by the current loop.

 Footnote 30 continued

 Similarly, having obtained above in Eq. 17 [T] = and using Τ — yielded for the electrostatic

 dimensions of the electric charge: [e] = L3/2M1/2T_1.

 31 Nowadays this would be expressed as the requirement that the magnet and the circuit must have the
 same magnetic moments.

 Dimensionally, this meant:

 [m\ χ L = [e]T-1 χ L2, (21)

 or W = ^ '' 'n systems of units. Together with [es] = L3^2T_1M1'/2 this result
 implied [ms] = L5/2T_2M1,/2, at odds with Maxwell's result [ms] = L'/2M1/2.

 Clausius explained his disagreement with Maxwell's results in the following way.

 He believed that Maxwell obtained the relation e = Mji (Eq. 16 above) from:

 L2M rei

 [pC] = ~ψ~ 311(1 LcJeT (22)

 and by then identifying [ρ] and [m].32 Substituting m for p, and multiplying both

 equations one gets [em] = ML2T-1 instead of ^ = LT-1. Clausius judged this
 reasoning incorrect because, he argued, it implies taking into account the force between

 a magnetic pole and a current. This force is electrodynamic in nature, so it cannot

 rightfully be used to derive electrostatic dimensions, Clausius concluded.

 3 The controversy: strategies and motivations

 The controversy begun in May 1882 with an article published in the Philosophical

 Magazine by Joseph David Everett, then professor of natural philosophy at Queen's

 College, Belfast (Everett 1882a, pp. 376-377).33 Everett briefly summarized Clau

 sius's reasoning, stating that it was based on the following equation, true in all systems
 of units:

 Pole χ Length = Current χ (Length)2 , (23)

 hence

 Pole = Current χ Length, (24)

 where the quantities were meant to represent their dimensions. He then noted that the
 electrostatic dimensions of current were M^2L3//2T~2, obviously from Coulomb's

 electrostatic law, and noted that these two relations implied the electrostatic dimensions

 of the magnetic pole to be M'/2L5/2T~2.34

 32 As was discussed above in Sect. 2.1 (Maxwell 1873, Vol. 2, chapter 10, § 623).

 33 Joseph David Everett (1831-1904) had been secretary of the Committee for the selection and nomen

 clature of dynamical and electrical units, which had been appointed by the British Association (British

 Association for the Advancement of Science 1875), and had published two treatises entirely devoted to
 units and dimensions (Everett 1875, 1879). He was professor of natural philosophy at Queen's College,
 Belfast for most of his career, from 1867 until 1897.

 34 From Coulomb's law between electrostatic charges, / = Zjp·, we have in terms of dimensions:
 [e2] = lf][r2] = Μ L Γ2 χ L2 = Μ L3T~2,
 i.e.[e] = M1/2L3/2T~1.
 Current has dimensions of charge divided by time, therefore in the electrostatic system of units: [current]
 = m'/2l3/2t—2.

 Using the relation Pole = Current χ Length then implies [pole] — Mi /2L5/2T 2.

 The dimensions of the magnetic pole: a controversy at the.

 305

 Everett deemed Clausius's analysis "unimpeachable" and went on to give another

 argument in its favor. The electromagnetic dimensions of a pole (using the relation
 for the force between two magnetic poles) are M1/2L3/2T~1 and those of a current
 M|/2l'/2T~1.35 This again yields [Pole] = [Current] χ [Length]. Finding the same
 relation in the electromagnetic system as the one reached by Clausius in the electro
 static system seemed to Everett an argument in Clausius's favor—which may seem

 odd considering that this result is the direct consequence of the equivalence between

 a circuit and a magnet, and therefore independent from the system considered (as

 Everett himself states). More importantly perhaps, Everett declared being unsure how

 Maxwell actually derived the result in his treatise and invited his readers to clarify this

 point.

 Everett's request did not go unheard. The following month, the reactions of three

 scientists were published in the Philosophical Magazine—as well as a translation of

 Clausius's paper: Joseph John Thomson and the Irish theorist Joseph Larmor each
 provided an article (Thomson 1882a; Larmor 1882), and in addition George Fran
 cis FitzGerald (then Professor of natural philosophy at Trinity College in Dublin)

 contacted Everett, who discussed Fitzgerald's contribution in his own paper (Everett
 1882b).

 In response to Everett's plea, Larmor and Fitzgerald provided derivations of

 Maxwell's result—according to which the electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic

 pole were M1/2L1/2. After discussing their suggestions, Everett compared them to

 Clausius's work, with a view to resolving the contradiction.

 In his article, Larmor had argued in favor of using the dimensional relation for the

 force between a magnet and a current (Larmor 1882, p. 430):36

 current χ L χ pole χ L~2 = force, (25)

 where "current," "pole" and "force" in fact stood for the dimensions of these physical

 quantities. This was the dimensional version of the following relation:

 force = T. (26)

 length of wire χ current χ pole

 (distance between the wire and the pole)2

 35 These were the electromagnetic dimensions of current given by Maxwell (Maxwell 1873, Vol. 2, chapter

 10, § 626). In order to obtain them he doubtless divided by Τ the electromagnetic dimensions for the

 electrostatic charge, [em] = M^L1/2. In turn, the latter were derived by taking the dimensional form of

 the expression for the magnetic form of Coulomb's law, i.e., Ή = ρ, and substituting in it the dimensional
 expressions for [m] and [H] in terms of e valid in all systems of units:

 [m] = Eq. 15 above); [W] = jjj··

 How Maxwell obtained the latter from his fifteen dimensional relations (Eqs. 9-13) is again unclear.

 [H\ = j then led to ^ χ ρ, and solving this for e indeed results in [em] = M^L1/2.

 36 This force had been discovered by Oersted and studied by Ampere.

 Solving for the pole, and using as the electrostatic dimensions of current the unani
 mously accepted M1/,2L3/2T-2,37 Larmor obtained Maxwell's result:

 306 S. G. de Clark

 MLT-2 χ L2 , n L3 ι n , n

 pole = ... ... , = Μ ^ —tt? = M1/2L1/2. (27)

 L χ M1/2L3/2r2 L5/2

 When discussing Larmor's work, Everett gave the more explicit relation but for one

 important difference: for reasons that will soon become clear, he introduced a constant

 *1 (Everett 1882b, pp. 431-432):

 length of wire χ current χ pole
 force = k\ — : — —7 (28)

 (distance between the wire and the pole)z

 Clausius's criticism that Maxwell used an electrodynamic relation to build the elec

 trostatic system is clearly relevant here. Everett's reaction to this is interesting: this

 may be so, he argued, but so did all other definitions of the unit of magnetic pole in the

 electrostatic system, including the one used by Clausius (Everett 1882b, p. 432). This

 is only partly true: although Clausius did take a current into account in his demonstra

 tion, the resulting equation embodied the equivalence between a circuit and a magnet;

 Larmor, on the other hand, expressed the force between them.

 The second derivation discussed by Everett, which had been sent to him by Fitzger

 ald, another Irish follower of Maxwell's, also yielded M'^L1/2 for the electrostatic

 dimensions of the magnetic pole (Everett 1882b, p. 432). However, it was based on

 yet a different relation: the "magneto-electric law" according to which the e.m.f. due

 to the motion of a conductor in a magnetic field is proportional to the length of the

 conductor, its speed and the field's intensity:

 e.m.f. α L χ ν χ Β. (29)

 If one then appealed to Coulomb's magnetic force law,38 this yielded:

 [e.m.f.] = Lx LT-1 χ [pole] χ L~2, (30)

 (or, according to Everett, [e.m.f.] = [£2] χ L χ LT-1 χ [pole] χ L~2, with ^2 = 1),
 hence:

 r ι ί [e.m.f.] [e.m.f.]
 [pole] = 5 ~ :— = [e.m.f.] χ Τ (31)
 F L χ LT"1 χ L-2 Τ"1

 The e.m.f. being the line integral of the electric field, its dimensions in the electrostatic

 system are M^L^T-1,39 hence, again, Maxwell's result:

 [pole] = M1/2L1/2T_1 χ Τ = M1/2L1/2

 (32)

 37 From Coulomb's electrostatic law the dimensions of charge in the electrostatic system of units are
 [e] = (see footnote 30 above), and those of current are simply these divided by T.

 38 More precisely, the relation that this force law implies for the magnetic intensity, i.e., [B] = [pole] xL~2.

 39 Recall from Eq. 17 that Maxwell had somehow obtained for the electric field Τ the dimensional

 The dimensions of the magnetic pole: a controversy at the.

 307

 Together with Clausius's work, these reactions inspired Everett the following com
 ment:

 the definitions of the unit quantity of electricity, the unit current, the unit electro

 motive force (or difference of potential), and the unit resistance (all of which may

 be called purely electrostatic definitions), are not in question, but are accepted by

 all parties. The divergence begins when we attempt to express magnetic quanti

 ties in an electrostatic system; and different results may be obtained according

 to the particular relation between magnetism and electricity which we select as

 the guiding principle in our definitions. In a strict sense there is no such thing as

 an electrostatic unit of any magnetic quantity; since magnetism and its relations

 to electricity lie outside the domain of electrostatics (Everett 1882b, p. 431).

 Everett compared the derivations offered by Larmor and Fitzgerald to Clausius's

 work, refraining the latter in a way that allowed him to draw his own conclusions

 (Everett 1882b, pp. 432-434). As noted above, in anticipation of his own arguments,

 Everett had introduced multiplicative constants in the equations used by Larmor and

 FitzGerald. He then took the same step with the relation used by Clausius that expressed

 the equivalence between a current loop and a magnet and added to it a constant ky.

 Pole χ Length = ^x Current χ Area (33)

 Everett then attributed the disagreements between on the one hand Larmor and

 Fitzgerald (hence Maxwell), and on the other Clausius, to an incompatibility between

 their implicit choices for the dimensions of these constants:

 [Clausius's result] disagrees with that of the two preceding investigations; and

 hence the two equivalent assumptions k\= 1, ki= 1 are inconsistent with the
 assumption 1 (Everett 1882b, p. 433).

 In order to obtain consistent results, one had to take either [£3] = L~2T2, in which

 case the dimensions of the pole were M^L1/2, or [&i] = [ki\ — L~2T2, and they
 then became M'/2L5/2T-2.40 kj in the former case, and k\ and £2 in the latter were

 attributed the dimensions of where ν is the ratio of the unit of electric charge

 in the electromagnetic system of units to its unit in the electrostatic system and has

 Footnote 39 continued

 relation [Τ] = valid in all systems of units. In the electrostatic system charge has dimensions

 [e] = L3/2M'/2T-1 (see footnote 30 notably), so in that system the electric field has dimensions:

 w=L%V'xrL"'/2M'/2r'
 and therefore the electrostatic dimensions of its line integral are [e.m.f.] = χ L =
 L1/2M1/2T-1

 40 [Pole] χ [Length] = [£3] χ [Current] χ [Area] yields in the electrostatic system of units, with [Current] =

 M'/2L3/2T-2 (see notably footnote 37):

 [Pole] χ L = [*3] χ Μ 1/2l3/2T"2 xL24 [Pole] = [k3] χ M1/,2L5/2T~2,
 so with [^3] = L"2T2 : [Pole] = L"2T2 χ Μ1/2^/2!-2 = Μ'^ί1/2,
 but when [it!] = [k2] = L~2T2, i.e. [fc3] = 1 : [Pole] = M1/2l5/2T~2.

 dimensions of speed LT-1. Everett favored the former, but only for the practical reason
 that it was more convenient in calculations.

 Everett did not stop there however: he also discussed the electromagnetic system of

 units, more convenient for electromagnetic calculations. These considerations led him

 to introduce three equations with three other constants (Everett 1882b, pp. 433-434):

 - for the force between two parallel currents in wires of length /:

 F — kn χ (current 1) χ (current 2) χ 2//distance, (34)

 - for the force between two magnetic poles:

 F = k$ x (pole 1) χ (pole 2)/(distance between the poles) , (35)

 - for the force between two electric charges:

 F = x (charge 1) χ (charge 2)/(distance between the charges)2. (36)

 The dimensions of these constants in each system of unit can be summarized as in
 Table 1).

 Recall that Fourier had introduced dimensional considerations to express the invari

 ance of physical equations. Without actually finding himself at odds with Fourier,

 Everett, by contrast, insisted on the conventional character of dimensional equations:

 although invariant under change of units within a given system, they could differ from

 one system to the next—where "system" here refers to a specific choice of funda
 mental units and the set of relations used in order to obtain the dimensions of derived

 quantities from these fundamental units (for instance, the electrostatic system), and

 not simply in Fourier's sense of a given set of units for the basic quantities (like L, M,

 Τ in the present context).

 The dimensions of the magnetic pole: a controversy at the...

 309

 A comparison of the foregoing six equations shows how cautious we ought
 to be in asserting that a particular dimensional relation "must hold in every

 system of units." The laws of nature which connect dissimilar quantities are

 laws of proportion, and it is only by convention that they can be stated as laws

 of equality.41

 controversy.42

 In other words, physical laws involved proportionality constants which could have

 dimensions. This issue was to become the focus of much attention, beyond the present

 Everett was not alone in inserting potentially dimensioned constants in fundamental

 equations to resolve the question. In the same issue of the Philosophical magazine,

 Joseph John Thomson responded to Everett's first description of Clausius's work by

 appealing to similar considerations (Thomson 1882a).43 Thomson's main point was

 that in the equation:

 Pole χ Length = Current χ (Length)2,

 i.e. magnetic moment = current χ area,

 Clausius should have taken into account the magnetic permeability μ of the material
 (Thomson 1882a, p. 427):

 magnetic moment = μ χ current χ area.

 Recall that in this relation, the left-hand side refers to a magnetic pole and the right

 hand side to a circuit deemed equivalent, in the sense that it produces the same magnetic

 force as the pole (when acting on another pole of the same strength). Thomson argued

 that the magnetic force due to a current does not depend on the surrounding medium,

 whereas the force due to a pole is inversely proportional to its magnetic permeability
 of the medium (Thomson 1882a, pp. 42S-429).44 From this he deduced the relation

 he advocated, Eq. 37.45

 (37)

 (38)

 (39)

 41 Everett (1882b, p. 434). Italics in the original.

 42 See concluding remarks.

 43 This article was published in the same issue as Everett's second paper, i.e., Everett (1882b).

 44 More specifically, Thomson discussed the magnetic force between a current and a pole, and the force

 between two poles. In order to conclude from these considerations their implications regarding Clausius's

 relation, what is at stake is the effect of, respectively, the circuit and of one of the two poles; one could

 describe the other pole involved in these two forces as a "test pole," and what Thomson calls "forces" actually

 corresponds to our field Η—and indeed, the Η generated by a current-carrying wire is independent of the
 permeability μ.

 45 Indeed, although Thomson did not make this explicit, his results implied:

 ^current loop a current χ area Fpoie a i χ magnetic moment

 s0 ^current loop = ^pole requires:

 current χ area a i χ magnetic moment,

 which motivated Thomson's modification of the relation magnetic moment = current χ area used by
 Clausius.

 S. G. de Clark

 Thomson further derived that μ had dimensions L 2T2 (Thomson 1882a, p. 428),

 so that the revised relation he advocated implied:46

 [poles] =

 μ χ current χ area

 length

 L-2T2xM'/2L3/2T-2xL2 = m1/2l1/2j

 (40)

 in agreement with Maxwell's result.47 Thomson therefore recovered what Everett

 deemed necessary to get Maxwell's result with Clausius's approach, namely a constant

 factor of dimensions = L_2T2 (Thomson 1882a, p. 429).

 A few months later, Thomson published a second paper in which he further devel

 oped his argument (Thomson 1882b). He noted that Clausius's assumption implied that

 46 Thomson's demonstration of this point was somewhat circular, in so far that the way he obtained the

 electrostatic dimensions of the permeability μ required using Μ1/2!.1''2 for the electrostatic dimensions of

 the magnetic pole (Thomson 1882a, p. 428). Indeed, μ is given by the ratio of the "magnetic induction"

 (i.e., our modern B) and the "magnetic force" (our field H, which he represented by F); now Thomson took

 the "magnetic induction" to be given by m/r2, which clearly involves the pole m:

 [μ] =

 Thomson had already derived the electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic pole to be MI/2LI/'2, without

 referring to the relation of interest (i.e., magnetic moment = μ χ currentx area): from the expression for

 the force between a current and a pole, he deduced that the product current χ pole must have dimensions

 of energy. Indeed, he took for what we would now call Η:
 Η = 2 current

 distance from wire'

 so that the work required to move a magnetic pole along a circle around the wire must be:

 work = Η χ pole χ distance moved = 2 wjre x pole χ 2π χ distance from wire.
 Hence the dimensions of the product current χ pole must be those of work, i.e., energy: ML2T-2. Since the
 electrostatic dimensions of current (from the relation between current and charge, and Coulomb's force law

 between electrostatic charges) were M1/'2L3/2T-2, it follows that the pole had electrostatic dimensions:
 r ι [energy) ML2T"2 »,1/2, 1/2
 im] - [current] ~ Ml/2L3/2T-2 - M L ■
 This indeed implied that the dimensions of μ were L-2T-2 as noted in the main text:

 M = Ml-2 = Hnt L-2 = Mg^L-2 = l-2t-2

 L distance from wire J £

 It is worth noting, however, that the dimensions of μ can also be obtained in a way that does not rely upon

 the dimensions of m: in the electrostatic system the dimensions of the force between two charges are £ j,

 and the dimensions of the force between two current-carrying wires are [μι/'], hence [μ^-]. Therefore,

 requiring that these forces have the same dimensions implies [μ^τ] = \^jr\^ = L~2T2.

 47 Thomson also obtained Μ1/2!.1/2 for the electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic pole without referring

 to the relation of interest (i.e., magnetic moment = μ χ current χ area): from the expression for the force

 between a current and a pole, he deduced that the product current χ pole must have dimensions of energy.

 Indeed, he had found for what we would now call the magnetic field Η (which he called magnetic force F):
 Η = 2 current

 distance from wire'

 so that the work required to move a magnetic pole a full circle around the wire must be:

 work = Η χ pole χ distance moved = 2 d;stanrc7rom wjre x P°le χ 2π χ distance from wire.

 Hence the dimensions of the product current χ pole must be those of work, i.e., energy: ML2T~2. Since

 the electrostatic dimensions of current (from the relation between current and charge, and Coulomb's force

 law between electrostatic charges) are M1/2L3/'2T~2, it follows that the pole has electrostatic dimensions:
 fm, _ [energy] _ ML2T~2 _ Ml/2, 1/2

 [current] m1/2L3/2T_2

 The dimensions of the magnetic pole: a controversy at the.

 311

 the dimensions of the force between poles were different from those of a mechanical

 force: indeed, inserting Clausius's electrostatic dimensions for the pole in Coulomb's

 law yields:

 r^l (MV'LV'T-f _ ΜΛ- _ ml3t_4>
 L r2 J L1 Lz

 which can only be reconciled with the accepted dimensions of mechanical force

 by inserting a properly dimensioned factor. Thomson commented that Maxwell's

 approach avoided such ad hoc adjustments, since it warranted homogeneity through

 the constants that express the influence of the medium. Indeed, using for the elec

 trostatic force between two charges, where κ is the electric permittivity of the medium,

 and ^ for the force between two poles, where μ is its permeability, resulted in those

 forces having the usual mechanical dimensions, as shown in Table 2.48

 Despite the formal similarity of their analysis, Thomson did not share Everett's

 neutrality toward Clausius's work. In his view, the Maxwellian necessity of the medium
 decided in favor of Maxwell's choice (Thomson 1882b, p. 429).

 The strategies and motivations of the other protagonists were quite different from

 Everett's and Thomson's. Larmor recovered Maxwell's result without introducing

 any additional factor in the equations (Larmor 1882, pp. 429-430). His strategy was

 dictated by the notion that some relationships are in some sense more fundamental

 and more natural than others. In his view, the relation used by Clausius,

 Magnetic moment = current χ area, (42)

 was inferior in these respects to the expression for the force between a current

 and a magnet—and to Coulomb's force law between magnetic poles (Larmor 1882,

 p. 429). Firstly, Larmor argued, one always made use of these expressions, if only
 tacitly. Secondly, Clausius's relation relied more on an analogy than on an actual

 phenomenon:

 The somewhat recondite fact that the magnetic action of a small circuit carrying a

 current may be represented as due to two fictitious magnetic poles, does not seem

 to possess any claims to supplant the natural statement of the only fundamental

 relation which makes natural poles play a part in electric theory at all. That

 relation is, of course, itself in its very nature electromagnetic.

 It might be said that the system objected to built up the theory from electric

 foundations, inasmuch as its fundamental magnet is a small electric current. But,

 in reply, it is the existence of actual magnets which introduces the idea of pole at

 all, other than as in Ampere's purely mathematical directrix of electrodynamic

 action (Larmor 1882, p. 430).

 and again:

 48 "These factors introduce themselves naturally through symbols representing some physical property of
 the body or medium." (Thomson 1882b, p. 226)

 The dimensions of the magnetic pole: a controversy at the.

 313

 The only simple fact of nature which connects pole with current is Oersted's phe

 nomenon (as developed by Ampere) of the existence of a mutual force between

 them [...]. Hence by this relation must we deduce the dimensions of pole already
 found (Larmor 1882, p. 430).

 Thus Larmor loathed Clausius's choice precisely for the reason that made it legitimate

 in Clausius's eyes: it expressed an equivalence between two distinct situations rather

 than an influence between two entities.49

 Larmor's concerns were largely shared by Charles Kasson Wead, physics Professor

 at the University of Michigan. Wead proposed yet a different derivation of Maxwell's
 results, which he attributed to Hermann Herwig (Wead 1882, pp. 530-533).50 This

 demonstration was based on the expression for the torque on a magnet placed in an

 external field, as being proportional to the intensity I of the magnetic field and the

 magnetic moment μ μ (Wead simply represented the latter by μ but it is best to avoid
 his notation since it was used above for permeability):51·52

 torque = / χ μ μ (43)

 and since [μ^] = [m][L], one gets (Wead 1882):

 [„,] = iaül = My2L3/2 χ 1 Ml/2Ll/2 (45)

 L·/ JL

 r„M ι - [torque] _ ML2t~2 _ MV2L3/2 m
 lms]~ [/.] ~ m1/2L1/2T~2 ~ ' ( '

 Like Larmor, Wead favored his demonstration over Clausius's because of the status

 he conferred to the analogy between current and magnet:

 [According to Clausius mL] must represent a magnet; consequently [the current]

 χ L2 is put equal to a magnet. But the passage of the current ordinarily produces

 effects, such as the movement of a galvanometer-needle, which we explain more

 naturally by saying that the circular current produces a magnetic field at its

 center, than by saying that the current is, or makes, or even is equivalent to,

 a magnet. Herwig's derivation, therefore, in which a magnet placed in a field

 experiences a couple, conforms to the ordinary way of thinking better than the

 way of Clausius, and is the way used in the derivation of the electromagnetic
 system... It may be noted that, in all discussions except that of Clausius, the

 magnet pole Ρ is introduced into the field. Clausius produces a field by the pole
 (Wead 1882, p. 531).

 49 It is also interesting to note that Larmor not only viewed some relations as more fundamental than

 others, but he also deemed the electrostatic system of units, and electrostatic phenomena at large, to be

 more fundamental than their electromagnetic counterparts.

 50 Herwig was then Professor of physics at Darmstadt.

 51 The electrostatic dimensions Wead attributed to 1 agreed with those for the field Η in Maxwell's treatise
 (Maxwell 1873, chapter 10).

 52 The dimensions of torque are given by: [torque] = [force] χ [lever arm] = MLT~2 χ L = ML2T-2.

 Wead deemed that "to write " C χ L2 = Ρ χ L in any consistent system" is simply
 begging the whole question." (Wead 1882, p. 532)

 In addition to preferring a relation expressing a force law to one based on an

 analogy, Wead also granted special status to two equations concerning magnetism:

 those relating the moment of a magnet suspended in the Earth's magnetic field and

 the horizontal component of the latter field.53 He noted that these equations led to the
 following dimensional relations:

 ML2 r α μ "iL5 ■,

 [μ*Β] = -r ^j = _=L3 (46)

 So that μ λ/ had dimensions m'/2L5//2T~', and Β had M1'/2L^1//2T~1, in all systems

 of units. Yet Clausius's equations implied that the first was not true, and according to

 Maxwell the second one was not. What motivated Wead to favor the two equations

 on which he based this argument were experimental considerations: "no physical

 formulae are better established" he wrote (Wead 1882, p. 532).

 Wead even presented a third line of reasoning, based on the order in which relations

 were used and the dimensions of quantities were found in the different systems of units.

 In the electromagnetic system the dimensions of the pole m were found first, then from

 them those of the magnetic moment μ μ, then those of the magnetic field Β (using the

 torque), those of the current C, and finally those of the electric charge:

 [m][m] [CIL

 L ij (47)

 [e][e\ [e] [C]L
 ^ = \F], γ = [C], = [Β], [Β] [μΜ] = [torque], [μΜ] = [m]L. (48)

 The two approaches differed by the physical quantity they took as primary, m or e:

 once the dimensions of either m or e had been obtained, those of the other quantities

 were established in a different order, but using the same equations.

 In contrast, as discussed above in Clausius's version of the electrostatic system,

 the dimensions of the magnetic moment, and hence of the pole, were obtained from a

 Κ: moment of inertia t: time γ and γ': lengths

 where μ^: magnetic moment of the magnet H . horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field

 Moment of inertia has dimensions Μ L2. Indeed from the angular version of Newton's second law, torque

 = moment of inertia χ angular acceleration:
 [moment of inertia] = [torque] χ [angular acceleration]-1 = ML2T-2 χ (Τ-2)-1 = ML2
 (see previous footnote for the dimensions of torque).

 Therefore the two equations yield the dimensional relations:

 = [m]L = [ßM] ·, [Β][μΜ] = [torque]; -j-y- = [5]; [e] = [C]T

 In the electrostatic system as advocated by Maxwell, the dimensions of the charge e

 were determined first, then those of the current C, then those of the magnetic field B,

 those of the magnetic moment μ through the torque and finally those of the pole:

 Thus Wead can be said to have favored a solution over the other on the basis of symme

 try between the electrostatic and electromagnetic systems. As he noted, this symmetry

 was reflected in the relations between the dimensions of the primary quantities (Wead

 1882, p. 532):54

 Yet for Wead, regarding some equations as more "natural" or "fundamental" than

 others was largely subjective, so that Clausius's reasoning was not actually incorrect.

 Wead was mostly concerned with practicality and the fact that the electromagnetic

 system is widely used. He argued:

 If Ρ be changed, three other quantities of the twelve that Maxwell discusses
 must have their dimensions changed, and confusion would be introduced into

 his system, that is based on fifteen equations, in each of which the second member

 is some simple mechanical quantity, as work, time, etc. Until it has been clearly

 shown how this system will be affected by the proposed change, and why the

 new expression is to be preferred to the older one, that has been "unimpeached"

 for some twenty years, is it not clearly better to write Pe = M1/2L1,/2 It is not

 a question merely of correctness, but of consistency, simplicity, and usefulness;

 and on all these grounds Maxwell's expression seems to the writer to deserve

 the preference (Wead 1882, p. 533).

 He even went as far as stating:

 In deducing the dimensions of physical quantities, there is much that is as arbi

 trary as the order in which several numbers shall be multiplied together (Wead

 1882, p. 533).

 For Wead, in the end the choice was purely one of convenience.

 54 These two equations can be obtained directly from Maxwell's system-independent relations, which take

 [mm] = m and [es] = e: Eq. 50 is essentially Eq. 16 above, and Eq. 50 corresponds to Eq. 15.

 55 Since [ms ciausiusl = L5/2T"2M1/2 and [es ciausius] = L3/2T_1M1/2 as usual.

 4 The resolution of the controversy

 The controversy ended in November with the intervention of the Maxwellian exper

 imentalist Oliver Joseph Lodge (Lodge 1882). It was probably largely inspired by

 Thomson's September paper, in which the latter insisted that homogeneity was satis
 fied through the constants already present in Maxwell's work (Thomson 1882b).56

 Lodge's approach is most interesting, both because it offers a synthetic view of the

 debate and because Lodge attributed the disagreements to the scientific culture of the

 protagonists, largely related to their nationality:

 The discussion which has been carried on in your pages respecting the dimen

 sions of a magnetic pole serves to illustrate the divergency of thought between

 those in this country who have been brought up, electrically, under Faraday and

 Maxwell, and the continental philosophers so eminently represented by Prof.

 Clausius. From one point of view the discussion may be said to have been roused

 by a simple mare's nest constructed by dropping a factor out of one side of an

 equation..but from another point of view it is the natural and inevitable con

 sequence of the different aspects from which these matters can be regarded: the

 English standpoint, in which the medium is recognized as the active agent, and

 is continually present both in the mind and in the formulae; and the continental

 standpoint, from which the medium is perceived as so much empty space, and

 is taken account as such in the formulae (Lodge 1882, p. 357).

 As Thomson had, Lodge argued for the need to take the electric inductive capacity

 Κ into account in the equation for the force between two charges and explained that
 Coulomb's electrostatic law - developed on the continent—was first meant as a law

 of proportionality. Faraday later established that it held only if the charges remained

 in the same medium and made Coulomb's law an equality by introducing the constant
 Κ to characterize this medium:

 ee'

 r-jH· (53)

 them from those of e and K. He noted from Eq. 53 that γ has the same dimensions

 as Fr2 in all systems of units so:

 2

 [e]=L[ KF}1'2. (54)

 Lodge then offered a dimensional demonstration reminiscent of Thomson's, but

 instead of assuming the dimensions of the various quantities to be known, he derived

 The electrostatic system resulted when Κ was arbitrarily taken to be dimensionless

 (Lodge 1882, p. 358).

 56 Lodge's paper was followed by an article by E.B. Sargant, but the latter mostly expressed his agreement

 with Lodge (Sargant 1882, pp. 395-396). Sargant is probably Edmund Beale Sargant (1855-1938), but this

 is not certain; the latter was educated in Cambridge and later distinguished himself through his contributions

 to education, notably in South Africa.

 Turning his attention to the controversial case, Lodge added the quantity μ to

 express the influence of the medium on the force between two magnetic poles (Lodge
 1882, p. 358):

 so that

 and

 [m] = L [μί-]1/2 , (56)

 ■—z = = L [F]1/2 = L [mLT-2!172 = L3/2T_1M1/2. (57)
 [y/K] [vW L J

 Determining dimensions for the pole then required to arbitrarily set those of μ. This

 choice, however, was a priori independent from that which fixes the dimensions of e.

 Lodge argued that whatever relationship may exist between m and e should become

 the focus of experimental research, notably by considering the equivalence between a

 magnet and a current loop:

 Magnetic moment α current χ area enclosed by the current loop. (58)

 The question was then whether this relationship was an equality or whether the medium
 had to be accounted for.

 By rephrasing the debate in this way, Lodge not only clarified it but also accounted

 for it by a difference in scientific culture. However, Lodge went beyond this in two

 ways: first, he offered an explanation as to why this specific cultural difference caused

 confusion (Lodge 1882, pp. 363-365), and second he argued that the issue could be

 resolved, through experiments.

 Indeed at the end of his paper Lodge gave himself the task to understand why

 Clausius had so easily accepted a result that differed from the standard one. Lodge
 noted:

 according to Weber's extension of Ampere's theory (an extension I [Lodge] sup
 pose universally accepted), the properties of magnetic substances of all kinds are

 explained by molecular electric currents, and no magnets or magnetic substances

 other than those consisting of current-conveying molecules exist. [...]

 The coefficient μ is thus foreign to Ampdre's theory applied universally; and this

 is how it has happened that Prof. Clausius has failed to recognize its existence
 and has been led into error." (Lodge 1882, p. 363)

 Lodge therefore thought that the salient difference between the British and continental

 scientific cultures was related to different understandings of Ampere's theory. He

 defended the British standpoint, but in fact contrary to what the above quotation might

 suggest he did not reckon the concept of permeability to be incompatible with an
 Am peri an model of magnetism. What Lodge deemed nonsensical was a model where

 microscopic currents would be bathed in an external medium itself characterized by

 a permeability μ. Instead, he thought Ampere's model fit to provide a microscopic
 account for permeability, understood as a macroscopic property:

 S. G. de Clark

 The effect of the medium is a physical fact; and no theory can presume really

 to dispense with the constant μ. All that the Amperian theory does is to give a

 physical interpretation to it, and to render one independent of it so soon as one

 takes account of every current-conveying circuit, whether molecular or other,

 existing in the field, and does not arbitrarily elect to deal only with those gross

 solenoids which we can excite and immediately control by batteries. (Lodge

 1882, p. 365)

 Rephrased in modern terms, one could say that Lodge thought permeability to be an

 emergent property of Amperian currents. In this respect he found himself in agreement
 with Maxwell:

 According to Ampere's hypothesis... the properties of what we call magnetized

 matter are due to electric currents, so that it is only when we regard the substance

 in large masses that our theory of magnetization is applicable, (quoted by Lodge

 1882, p. 365, Maxwell 1873, Chapter 9, Art 615)

 So Lodge pointed out that the disagreements could be explained by a difference in

 scientific culture, but having said this he then consciously endeavored to deepen our

 understanding of this difference, and then used the resulting insights to in turn help

 clarify the original issue.

 Ultimately though, Lodge stressed that experiments were needed to settle whether

 the equivalence relationship at stake (Eq. 56) should involve permeability: the mag

 netic effects of a current and a magnet in media of different permeabilities had to be

 compared experimentally, because the results were still open to debate.57 What was

 at stake was to confirm (or invalidate) the predictions of Maxwell's theory regarding

 the comparative behavior of poles and macroscopic currents in media of different

 permeabilities—not to explore issues not already covered in Maxwell's work.

 J.J. Thomson had already made a similar suggestion (Thomson 1882a, p. 429,

 Lodge 1882, p. 359) but unlike Thomson, Lodge drew the distinction between medium
 in the region surrounded by the current and medium in the region surrounding it

 (consequently he wished to use solenoids). The scenarios he proposed to investigate

 and the results he predicted on the basis of Maxwell's work are summarized in Table
 3 (Lodge 1882, pp. 361-362):

 Lodge wished to know whether the fields due to a solenoid and a magnet remained

 the same irrespective of the permeability of the medium. If not, the equivalence relation

 between magnet and current (Eq. 58) should be modified accordingly to include μ.

 Like Thomson, he expected it should be. However, Thomson's treatment implied that

 57 Indeed after referring to Clausius's choice as an "error," Lodge stated in a footnote:

 "In using the term "error" here, I would be understood to mean rather "divergency from opinions commonly

 held in this country" than absolute incorrectness as to matter of fact. For it would not be becoming to apply

 the latter term to views held by Prof. Clausius when the experimental foundation of opposing views is

 confessedly incomplete. The views held by Prof. Clausius are no doubt perfectly consistent and would

 probably be in accord with fact if only the medium produced no effect such as it is here [i.e., in Great
 Britain] commonly supposed to produce; and whether the medium does or does not produce such an effect

 appears to some extent at present a subject of legitimate debate and a matter for experimental investigation."
 (Lodge 1882, p. 364)

 b Lodge stated regarding the third scenario: "This latter seems to be the kind of experiment which Mr. J.J.

 Thomson suggests in his June letter (p. 429), and which, he says, Mr. Sargant then intended (and I hope
 still intends) to carry out" (Lodge 1882, p. 362). And indeed since Thomson did not distinguish between

 regions outside versus inside the current, he would not have taken the extra precautions necessary to prevent

 the interior of the solenoid to fill with the medium surrounding it, which corresponds to case 3

 the relevant permeability was that of the outer region.58 Lodge insisted that the latter

 had no effect (as case 2 was meant to show) and that it was the inner one that mattered.59

 58 The situation discussed by Thomson was equivalent to setting dinner = Pouter in case 3, so Thomson

 stated that the magnetic force due to a circuit was the same as in air, hence independent of the medium. He

 argued that the magnetic force due to a magnet goes as the inverse of the permeability of the medium, but

 having no way of distinguishing:

 Field due to current = dinnerx Field due to magnet
 from:

 Field due to current = //outer x Field due to magnet,

 he argued for the latter.

 59 Lodge quoted Maxwell to justify his predictions:

 S. G. de Clark

 Lodge certainly seems to have convinced his British colleagues, for the controversy

 ended with an article by E.B. Sargant in the same issue of the Philosophical magazine,
 in which the author concurred:60

 His [Lodge's] suggestion seems to me to reconcile the views of Prof. Clausius

 and Mr. J.J. Thomson on this subject. A model of the magnetic system must be

 made in a substance of the same magnetic permeability as the medium that is to

 surround the current-system, and must be substituted in the place of the magnets,

 before any comparison can be effected. The two systems, current- and magnetic,

 will then be always equivalent if once equivalent. (Sargant 1882, p. 395)

 Nevertheless Lodge's suggestions calls for a number of remarks. For the purpose of

 figuring out the electrostatic dimensions of m, the macroscopic experiments proposed

 do seem to fulfill their duty. In so far that a magnetic pole and a current giving rise to

 the same magnetic force justifies viewing them as equivalent, the experiments do tell

 us about what form this equivalence should take.

 However, it is doubtful that Lodge intended his macroscopic solenoids to serve

 as models for the behavior of Amperian currents.61 As Lodge himself insisted, since

 the latter are responsible for the permittivity effect of the medium (i.e., essentially

 constitute the latter), a model where the microscopic currents themselves would be

 bathed in such a medium is nonsensical. The solenoids discussed were merely meant

 to establish the equivalence relationship at the macroscopic level.

 In fact, Lodge did not expect the equivalence relation62 to involve permeability at

 the fundamental, microscopic level of description, precisely because the latter involved

 only currents and no medium:

 We may accept [...] without hesitation Clausius's presentation of Maxwell's

 views, viz. both that a small magnet is an electric current, and that magnetic cur

 rent ALWAYS equals simply integral current χ area—remembering, however,

 that there exist currents in molecules besides the gross and artificial currents in

 our copper wires, that these are directed by our artificial currents and add their

 Footnote 59 continuned

 I venture with diffidence to think that Maxwell would have drawn a distinction between the medium inside

 the region of the solenoid corresponding to the substance of the magnetic shell, and that outside. He over

 and over again lays stress upon the fact that artificial solenoids can only be compared with magnetic shells

 for the space outside the shells... (Lodge 1882, pp. 360-361)

 The purpose of the proposed experiments was to verify this.

 60 Sargant also stated that an experiment that he had performed at the Cavendish Laboratory in June was

 in agreement with Lodge's view (Sargant 1882), but unfortunately he did not give any details. In the same

 issue of November Lodge had also reported that Sargant had expressed the intent to carry out what I called

 case 3 above, thereby implying that he believed Sargant had not yet done so.

 61 Whether Sargant actually had this in mind when he spoke of "model of the magnetic system" is unclear.

 In any case, the fact that Lodge's experiments involved two types of solenoids ("open" ones whose internal

 medium changed with the external one and "closed" solenoids with fixed internal medium) made it tempting
 to assume these could be meant as alternative models for the behavior of Ampferian currents.

 62 At least, when understood as a relationship between physical quantities, as opposed to dimensions.

 effects, and that in all cases they are most distinctly to be taken into account.63

 (Lodge 1882, p. 364)

 Again, this was in agreement with Maxwell's views:

 ... if our mathematical methods are supposed capable of taking account of what

 goes on within the individual molecules they will discover nothing but electric

 circuits, and we shall find the magnetic force and the magnetic induction every

 where identical, (quoted by Lodge 1882, p. 365, Maxwell 1873, Chapter 9, Art
 615)

 That is to say, at the fundamental level Β = μ χ Η becomes Β = Ή.

 It is only at the macroscopic level that Lodge held the equivalence relation took the

 form:

 to:64

 Magnetic moment — μχ current χ area enclosed by the current loop, (59)

 At that level, microscopic currents conspired to form the macroscopic μ according

 B = B macro. +ßmedium = W + 4πΤ = W + 4ττ (κΉ) = (1 + 4πκ) χ Η = μ χ Ή,

 currents

 (60)

 where Τ is the magnetization and the "coefficient of induced magnetization" (Maxwell

 1973, Vol.2, § 426). In contrast, at the fundamental, microscopic level:

 Β = ^currents —Ή. (61)

 However, it is not the fundamental level that Lodge deemed relevant for the electrostatic

 dimensions of the magnetic pole, but the macroscopic one. Why is unclear, but one

 can readily find two possible (and mutually compatible) explanations.

 Perhaps Lodge held that μ could not be neglected for dimensional purposes even

 at the microscopic level. Indeed eliminating μ and from the dimensional counterparts

 of Eqs. (59) and (60) implies that the dimensions of several physical quantities differ
 in the microscopic and the macroscopic realms.65 Perhaps this would have seemed

 perfectly acceptable to Lodge (after all, dimensions differed in different systems of

 units), but then again perhaps not.

 63 The earlier quotation "All that the Ampdrian theory does is to give a physical interpretation to it, and

 to render one independent of it so soon as one takes account of every current-conveying circuit, whether

 molecular or other, existing in the field, and does not arbitrarily elect to deal only with those gross solenoids

 which we can excite and immediately control by batteries" implies something similar.

 64 Lodge stated: "... in media consisting of Ampferian molecules there is an extra magnetic induction [in

 addition to that due to macroscopic currents], due to the pointing of these along the lines of force, which

 is 4tt times the magnetization, and which has to be added to the other, thus making the total magnetic

 induction at any point μ times the magnetic force (i.e., H) there." (Lodge 1882, pp. 364-365)

 65 That is the dimensions of either Β or Ή [see Eq. (60)] and those of the magnetic moment and, of course,
 m [Eq. (59)].

 S. G. de Clark

 In any event, the systems of units had been developed on the basis of macroscopic
 phenomena (notably since the latter were involved in absolute measurements). Hence

 for the issue at hand, the relevant description had to be the macroscopic one.

 5 Concluding remarks

 The controversy regarding the dimensions of the magnetic pole in the electrostatic

 system therefore gave rise to different strategies, which often corresponded to differ

 ent criteria for selecting the defining relation of a quantity. Some argued that a relation

 should be used because it expressed an analogy between two situations rather than a

 force between entities (Clausius). Others used the opposite criterion (Larmor, Wead).

 Some took certain equations, or even phenomena, to be more fundamental than others

 (Larmor, Wead). Some also presented symmetry arguments (Wead). Still others sug

 gested the introduction of dimensioned constants in the equations (Everett, Thomson,

 Lodge). The latter strategy is the one that ultimately resolved the controversy, when

 Lodge argued that the disagreement was related to differences in scientific cultures,

 insofar as the said constants expressed the influence of the medium as imagined by
 British natural philosophers, whereas the medium was traditionally ignored on the
 Continent.

 In contrast to this diversity in their approach, most of the participants certainly seem

 to have expected that there was indeed a fact of the matter regarding the electrostatic

 dimensions of the magnetic pole. Only Wead can be said to have displayed more

 pragmatic motives.

 It is noteworthy that throughout the controversy, none of the protagonists expressed

 dissatisfaction with the fact that electromagnetic quantities had different dimensions in

 the different systems of units. Concerns over the matter only begun to be raised the fol

 lowing year, i.e., in 1883, in France. Although heavily influenced by Maxwell in other

 respects, two telegraph engineers, Ernest Mercadier (1839-1906) and Aime Vaschy

 (1857-1899), strongly condemned this status quo in a series of papers (1883a, 1883b,

 1883c, 1883d). To what extent their protest had been inspired, or merely influenced,

 by the 1882 controversy surrounding the electrostatic dimensions of the magnetic

 pole discussed here is unclear. Mercadier and Vaschy's timing is of course suggestive.

 Furthermore, they defended the view that the resolution of the ambiguity laid in deter

 mining the dimensions of the constants in the force laws and stressed that the issue

 could only be ultimately resolved by experimental investigations. However, they did

 not refer to the British debate, and even more significantly, they took for granted the

 relation expressing the equivalence between magnet and current, without referring to

 the issue of the permeability of the medium.

 That the multiplicity of dimensions in the different systems of units was not brought

 up during the British controversy may seem surprising, notably because the two issues

 had much in common. As briefly mentioned above, they notably raised the question
 of what dimensions should be attributed to the constants in the force laws. Most of the

 British controversy focused on μ, i.e., kß in J.J. Thomson's classification, and the latter

 also called attention on the importance of kg and ki; Mercadier and Vaschy focused

 on kö and IC4. In and of itself, this difference between the two debates certainly does

 not seem very profound.

 In contrast, Mercadier and Vaschy were motivated by very different views. They

 held a conception of homogeneity faithful to the etymological meaning of the term:

 they argued that a given physical quantity should have a unique legitimate set of

 dimensions because the latter were determined by the very nature of this physical

 quantity. This conception is to be contrasted with that championed by Fourier and

 Maxwell whereby dimensions were purely defined in terms of units—and tension

 between the two views underlay much of the debates regarding dimensional analysis

 for the rest of the century. That the British protagonists of the 1882 controversy did not

 question the legitimacy of having different dimensions in different systems of units for

 the same physical quantity certainly goes to show how natural such plurality seemed to

 them after dimensions had been defined in terms of conversion factors. The pluralism

 of units led people to expect an analogous one for dimensions.
