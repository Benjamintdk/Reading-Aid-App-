 Abstract Emmy Noether's many articles around the time that Felix Klein and David

 Hubert were arranging her invitation to Göttingen include a short but brilliant note

 on invariants of finite groups highlighting her creativity and perspicacity in algebra.

 Contrary to the idea that Noether abandoned Paul Gordan's style of mathematics for

 Hubert's, this note shows her combining them in a way she continued throughout her

 mature abstract algebra.

 1 Introduction

 Emmy Noether's first major article in mathematics was a four-page note on invariants

 of finite groups, which she published while Felix Klein and David Hubert were arrang-
 ing her invitation to Göttingen. One page essentially solves the problem merely by

 stating it compactly, the next two pages give two explicit solutions, and the last page

 describes related work. The opening line correctly claims that these explicit solutions

 are shorter and simpler than the already known Hilbert-style proof that these solutions
 exist Noether (1916, p. 89).

 The article grew out of Noether's work on Hubert's algebra but she did not convert
 to that and abandon the old-fashioned symbolic algebra of her dissertation teacher

 Paul Gordan. On the contrary, this article marks her first step in merging Gordan's

 methods with Hubert's, an approach to finite groups that she would continue to develop

 throughout the rest of her career, culminating in her plenary address at the 1932 Inter-
 national Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich (Noether 1916, 1926, 1929, 1932).

 And contrary to what is sometimes lazily supposed, and as Corry (1996, p. 170) justly
 says, Hubert's axiomatic algebra was never abstract because it always had "immedi-

 ate, intuitive significance" but Gordan on the other hand taught that highly practical
 tools can be remote from classical intuition.

 100 C. McLarty

 This article offers three histories of Noether (1916). Each one explains how Noether

 came to the problem, how she solved it, and why she wrote it up as she did. Any one

 of them would be entirely satisfactory by itself if the others did not exist. One shows

 the article creating a symbolic formalism for calculating invariants in Gordan's style,

 another bases the work on Galois theory, and the third makes it Noether's creative
 response to Dedekind and Hubert's algebra of groups and modules. After discussing
 Noether's generally ahistorical outlook the article closes by arguing that her abstract

 algebra unified Gordan's view of mathematics with Hubert's.

 2 Klein's triad

 Among mathematicians in general, three main categories may be distinguished;

 and perhaps the names logicians, formalists, and intuitionists may serve to char-
 acterize them.

 -Klein (1894, p. 2)

 It is very likely that Noether knew these terms, which Klein published in English,
 because Klein was a family friend, Noether was certified to teach English, and all the

 mathematicians Klein gave as examples were household names from her childhood on.

 In any case Klein's typology illuminates the larger significance of her work. His logi-
 cians, formalists, and intuitionists did not urge different foundations for mathematics

 but used different working styles. Let us call thesefirst-phase logicism, formalism and

 intuitionism. We cannot enter here into the lively history of how first L.E.J. Brouwer

 and then Hubert co-opted the first-phase terms into the later foundational controversy

 with the meanings that they have today, but we will say that the way to this co-optation
 was cleared when Noether, among others, unified all three of these working styles so

 smoothly that the first-phase meanings became idle.

 Klein explained his terms this way:

 (1) The word logician is used here, of course, without reference to the mathemat-

 ical logic of Boole, Peirce, etc.; [it indicates an] ability to give strict definitions
 and to derive rigid deductions therefrom. The great and wholesome influence
 exerted in Germany by Weierstrass in this direction is well known. (2) The for-

 malists among the mathematicians excel mainly in the skillful formal treatment

 of a given question, in devising for it an "algorithm." Gordan [...] must be

 ranged in this group. (3) To the intuitionists, finally, belong those who lay partic-

 ular stress on geometric intuition, not in pure geometry only, but in all branches
 of mathematics.

 Emmy Noether's first great mathematics 101

 Clebsch must be said to belong both to the second and third of these categories,

 while I should class myself with the third, and also the first.

 (Klein 1894, p. 2)

 Noether's dissertation was purely formalist in these terms. It relied on long sym-

 bolic calculations devoid of geometry and burdened with famously obscure definitions

 and deductions taken from Gordan. We will see that (Noether 1916) was a great step

 toward making her a logician. Furthermore, at just about the same time, Noether was

 absorbing Sophus Lie's geometrical group theory in order to produce her conservation
 theorems in mechanics. Geometric intuition would underlie much of her work after

 that. Most relevantly for us, her work directly descended from (1916) "introduced
 the idea of representation space" by which Emil Artin says "she enables us to use
 our geometric intuition" in group representation theory (Artin 1950, p. 67). Noether

 was hardly alone in bringing rigor, calculation, and geometry together. Easier com-
 munication and the sheer rising number of mathematicians required and facilitated

 a trend to uniform styles of expression and standards of rigor. Publishers, notably

 Springer- Verlag, disseminated these in ever more easily available books and journals.
 But Noether was a key player and the algebraic style which she made by combining

 these in her particular way would descend through van der Waerden and Bourbaki to

 become the central unifying device of twentieth century mathematics. Once Klein's

 three working styles all succeeded so well as to become largely common property of

 all mathematicians, they were idle as a trichotomy.

 3 The place of the work in Noether's life

 There was nothing rebellious in her nature; she was willing to accept conditions

 as they were.

 - Weyl(1935,p.43O)

 Weyl probably heard this from Noether's younger brother Fritz, who was very close

 to her, and it was probably true throughout her life in pretty, quiet Erlangen until
 1915 when she was 33, the year she sent her (1916) to the Mathematische Annalen.1

 As is well known, her father Max Noether was a noted professor of mathematics at
 Erlangen who encouraged her education and admired her work. The other Erlangen
 mathematics professor was Gordan, who was more famous than her father, and even-

 tually became her doctoral advisor when she turned to mathematics. She studied for

 one semester in Göttingen in 1903, but her dissertation of 1908 with Gordan pursued a

 huge calculation that had stumped Gordan forty years before and which Noether could

 not complete either. So far as I know no one has ever completed it or even checked it

 as far as she went. It was old-fashioned at the time, a witness to the pleasant isolation
 of Erlangen, and made no use of Gordan's own work building on Hubert's ideas.2

 102 C. McLarty

 She now supervised dissertations under her father's name. She was elected to the
 Circolo Matematico di Palermo in Italy in 1908 and the Deutsche Mathematiker-

 Vereinigung in 1909. By age 30 in 1912 she was known to and respected by most of

 the important mathematicians in Germany, and she was well into what anyone would

 have called a successful career as a mathematician, except, of course, that she had nei-

 ther title nor salary. Noether probably saw no reason for any of this to change, and she

 would be known today in the history of women in mathematics if it had not changed -

 but change it did. When Gordan retired in 1910 he was replaced by two students of
 Hubert: Erhard Schmidt (b. 1876) and Ernst Fischer (b. 1875), and Noether worked

 with both. She especially worked with Fischer and they credit each other extensively

 in their articles. In the next few years she became remarkably productive, publishing

 on classical invariant theory, and on transcendental numbers using Zermelo's axiom

 of choice. More importantly, conversations with Fischer especially led her to a series
 of four articles (1913, 1915, 1916, 1918a), of which the third is our chosen focus. The

 first lays out the whole series, so that the last incidentally shows how long Noether

 might hold on to an article between doing most of the work and finishing the publica-

 tion. The second addresses Hubert's 14th problem, is by far the longest, has the most

 technical results, and covers the most topics. The fourth applies her results to Galois

 theory.

 Section 5 of (1915) includes the quantities x¡ ' and the polynomial <P(z, u) we

 focus on and Noether reasonably says the result of our chosen article is "implicit"

 here (1916, p. 92).3 The whole series shows Noether as a powerful creative algebraist

 such as no one could have imagined from her work before - although it pales in com-

 parison to the work to come - and (1916) has the most astonishing proof and is closest

 to Fischer's question that motivated the whole series.4 The histories offered here draw

 on the whole series and apply to the whole, but they lead especially to (1916).

 In 1915 Noether went to Göttingen. Throughout the First World War and then the

 German Revolution Noether lived on the edge of poverty, became a radical socialist, a

 radical algebraist, and the teacher of "without exception all the better young German
 mathematicians" according to the influential Solomon Lefschetz at Princeton, who
 was himself unsympathetic to abstract algebra (Kimberling 1981, quoted p. 35). The

 article on finite groups examined here is the first brilliant show of her strength.

 Noether's proofs were (and remain) startling in their simplicity.

 Emmy Noether's first great mathematics 103

 The article opens with a standard problem in group theory of the time: find all the

 polynomial invariants of a finite group f) of linear transformations.5 Noether wrote

 the i, j-th component of each matrix A* as a' • . By matrix multiplication each matrix
 A k carries each series of quantities {Größenreihe - we would say a vector) x' . . . xn

 to a new series of quantities which Noether calls x[ . . . Xn . The specific equation is

 The familiar matrix calculation shows the result of applying Aj to x¡ is x¡3 the
 same as applying the composite AjAk to x¡.

 An invariant of ft is a polynomial f(x' ...xn) whose value is unchanged by any

 action of ft.6 That is, for each A* in ft

 xi - 2Liaivxv
 v=l

 f(x) = f(XW)

 Here x abbreviates the series x' . . . xn and x^ abbreviates the transformed series

 x['..Xn'A simple example will help. Let S) contain just two matrices:

 *-(i?)*-(~o-°.)

 Because these are 2 x 2 matrices, the group acts on pairs of quantities x' , JC2. Since

 Ai is the identity matrix it acts by

 And A2 multiplies each quantity by -1:

 xx - x' x2 - X2

 Xi _ - - X' ri Xy _ - - X2
 Xi ^.(2) _ - - X' ri Xy r(2) _ -

 So a polynomial f(x' , X2) is invariant if and only if f(x' , X2) = f(-x' , -X2), and
 it is easy to see that / meets this condition if and only if every term of / has even

 degree, so that the minus signs cancel out. The invariants xx and x'X2 and x' give a
 complete basis. Every invariant polynomial f(x' , X2) can be written as a polynomial

 combination of these three in at least one way; for example, the invariant x'x' can be
 written two ways:

 {x'Ýxl or x'(xxX2Ý

 5 As was common, Noether is silent as to the field they are linear over. Noether (1915, p. 163) notes that
 some steps require the field have characteristic 0. Noether (1926) introduces great new ideas to eliminate
 that assumption.

 0 Noether here calls polynomials "integral rational functions," following the general tendency in Dedekind,

 Hubert, and Weber to favor the field of rational functions over the ring of polynomials.

 Noether essentially solved the problem merely by noting that an invariant is any

 polynomial f(x) that is equal to the average of all its transformed values:

 104 C. McLarty

 1 h

 f{x) = -Tf{x^) (1)

 Any Aj acting on the two sides turns the left side to f{x^)' and it leaves the right hand
 sum unchanged as it merely permutes the terms, turning each f(x^) into f(x^k^).
 So each f(x^) equals that one sum. But since each term in the sum contains just one
 of the x^k' every permutation of the series of quantities leaves the sum unchanged,
 which solves the problem! The f) invariant polynomials are precisely those equal to

 some polynomial symmetric in the transformed series of quantities x^k'

 Note carefully what it means to be symmetric in several series of quantities. Noe-

 ther was not now talking about functions that remain unchanged when the quantities

 in any one series

 xW = {x'k)...xW)

 are permuted among one another. She was talking about polynomials in several series

 jc(1) . . . x^ that are unchanged when these series are interchanged entirely with one

 another. The superscripts are permuted while the subscripts are unchanged, so each

 x¡J is changed to some x¡ .

 Noether said it was "well known" that every polynomial symmetric in several

 series is some polynomial combination of the "elementary symmetric functions" of
 these several series.7 To find all the invariants for the group f), one takes the finitely

 many elementary symmetric functions of the several series *(1) . . . *(/l) and replaces

 each quantity x'k) by its equivalent in terms of the original x' . . . xn and the matrix

 coefficients af^ . This gives a finite set of invariant functions of x' . . . xn . Every invari-
 ant function of them is some polynomial combination of these. In short, these form a

 finite complete system of invariants for ft. She gives a second complete system, which

 we shall not consider, using power sums of these same x' '

 Symmetric polynomials were part of classical nineteenth century algebra. The deep

 difficulty in 1916, and still today, is to understand the jc^ , which Noether called quan-
 tities {Größen). They cannot simply be numbers or elements of some field, for, to get

 the basis of invariants we must distinguish x'k) from Xpj) whenever i ' ^ p or k ^ y,
 and make the appropriate substitution in terms of the correct corresponding sum

 n n

 v=l v=l

 ^a^xv or else ^a(pj)vxv

 7 Noether (1916, p. 90) has not one but two footnotes to this well-known fact, neither citing a proof. It is
 not in Weber (1895, 1912). It is stated without proof in Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften
 Bd. 1, Teil IB, 3b. Junker (1893) proves it in terminology resembling Noether's. These polynomials were
 Gordan's bread-and-butter means of forming invariants but I do not find this result stated in his work.

 Inspired by Noether, Weyl (1939, p. 37) proves the result as the "First Main Theorem" of invariant theory.

 Each x¡ must register the identity of xi and A¿. But how? Before giving the histories
 of Noether's article we look at the basic options at the time.

 5 Algorithmic versus the new algebra

 The difference between Gordan-style algorithmic and Dedekind-Hilbert-style axio-
 matics comes down to the difference between variables as calculating symbols and

 variables as objects varying over the elements of some algebraic structure. That dis-
 tinction was hard to make in 1916. Weber (1912), a textbook that Noether cites and

 very likely owned, favors the traditional identification of "algebra" with algorithmic

 and explains it this way:

 In analysis one is accustomed to understand a "variable" as a sign which takes
 successively different values. Algebra uses the word variable as well but in a
 different sense. Here it is a mere calculating symbol (Rechnungssymbole) with
 which one operates by the rules of calculating with letters (Buchstabenrech-
 nung). (1912, p. 47)

 This may seem clear. In analysis the variables vary over the real or complex num-

 bers (or some related set) while algebra often calculates with letters by formal rules.
 Weber's larger textbook says letter calculation is the chief tool of algebra. But his
 fuller explanation shows the distinction is unstable:

 The use of this tool is so general that one often uses the word Buchstabenr-

 echnung as a synonym for algebra.... Equations between letter expressions are
 so-called identities [when] two expressions set as equal can be deformed by
 applying the calculating rules so that the two come to agree exactly. Then one

 gets correct numerical equations from the letter equations when the letters are

 replaced by any kind of number whether real or complex, so long as one has not

 tried to divide by zero. The letters in such equations may also be called variables

 because one may think, without falling into contradiction, that successively one

 after another numerical value is set for the letters. (Weber 1895, p. 20)

 In analysis variables take successively different values, while in Buchstabenrech-

 nung we may, if we wish, think that they do! This is not a clear distinction. Weber was

 deeply concerned with principles and did not merely intend a pragmatic orientation
 for beginners. That was just the best he could do.8

 Furthermore, Weber underrated how far symbolic calculation might differ from

 numerical. In the symbolic method that Gordan taught to Noether, an equation P = Q
 need not even imply P2 = Q2. Indeed, if the first equation holds with P a numerical

 expression and Q a symbolic one, then the second is not even well-formed and using
 it would lead to contradiction. Given the general binary quadratic form

 8 Gottlob Frege argued decisively that mathematics cannot all be formal but took no position on the legiti-
 mate role of formalism. In personal communication Jamie Tappenden says Frege knew the symbolic method
 for invariants but recorded no position on it, and Frege's sense of the formal shifted over time.

 Ax2 + IBxy + Cy2

 the method creates symbols a' , ai with

 a2 = A and «1^2 = B and a' = C

 so that

 (flijc + a2 j)2 = Ajc2 + 2£x;y + Cy2

 The symbols ai, «2 occur to total degree 2 in these equations. A numerical term can

 be equated to a symbolic expression only when each symbol pair such as a' , #2 occurs
 in the expression to total degree 2 (Gordan 1887, Vol. II, p. 2). For example, setting
 the values A = C = 1 and B = 0 gives theorems on the particular quadratic form

 X2 + Y2. But this substitution into the symbolic equation (a'a2)2 = a'a' would show
 0=1 this way:

 0 = B2 = (a'ai)2 = a'a' = AC = 1

 The symbolic equation is correct and indispensable for Gordan. But it contains a' and

 Ü2 with total degree 4, so numerical substitution is not allowed.

 Today we use sets to model axioms on one hand; and symbolic calculation by string

 matching, usually computerized, on the other. In the first, variables in the axioms range

 over elements of those sets. The second uses finite symbol strings and is often regarded

 as a coding of arithmetic. Noether's algebra would do a great deal in the 1920s and
 1930s to advance the first although she took little interest in logic or foundations. The
 second could not become clear until Kurt Gödel, Emil Post, Alan Turing and others

 produced the modern idea of algorithm in the 1 930s. But the Weber quotes above show

 that nineteenth century mathematicians already made an important while unclear dis-

 tinction between symbolic variables and variables which take successively different
 values.

 6 Noether (1916) as symbolic algebra

 The history of Noether (1916) closest to her own words depicts it as formalist in

 Klein's sense, an example of Gordan's influence: each jc^ is a mere symbol explicitly
 indicating a group element A* and a quantity x¿ . The calculations above constitute the

 proof and need no interpretation. Noether calculates with the central tools of Gordan's

 theory, which she called elementary symmetric polynomials in several series of quan-
 tities and he called the elementary symmetric polynomials polarized in those several
 series.9

 9 For each k < n the coefficient of zn~k in Noether's <P(z, u) is the polarization of the fc-th elementary

 symmetric polynomial £?¿(jq . . . xn) as defined by Gordan (1875, p. 4). Polarization is a device which can
 be defined either by polynomial expansion or by mixed partial derivatives, so that the complete polarization

 Emmy Noether's first great mathematics 107

 On this history, Noether used the kind of tools Gordan taught her and solved the

 kind of problem he solved. In fact Noether gave a slicker solution than Gordan to a

 more far-reaching problem. Gordan had found a complete basis of invariants for the

 (infinite) group of all linear transformations of binary (i.e., two-variable) forms of

 any fixed degree n, Noether found a complete basis of invariants for any finite group

 acting linearly in any finite number of variables. Noether's problem had wider scope,

 she found a more elegant solution than is yet known for Gordan's, and her method led

 to vastly more further research.

 There is, however, a mathematical problem. On this interpretation the proof is
 merely plausible and attractive. Noether never stated a criterion for the correctness

 and completeness of the symbolic rules, still less did she prove that they are complete.

 It is far from clear that these rules yield all the relevant equations on actual polyno-

 mials, and this is a mathematical defect no matter how productive the proof was to
 be in the long term. But this is no objection to the historical account. If anything it

 supports the account, since Gordan's method had the same defect to higher degree. It

 was extremely persuasive at the time, and universally accepted, and his results have
 since been confirmed by other means. But possibly no one ever understood Gordan's

 proofs. As Max Noether said in his eulogy of Gordan

 For each work he compiled volumes of formulas, very well ordered, but provid-

 ing a minimum of text. His mathematical friends undertook to prepare the text

 for press and correct the printer's proofs. They could not always produce a fully
 correct conception and one often misses the deeper ground on which the con-

 siderations are laid. Only a few of his publications, and especially the earliest,

 express Gordan's specific style: bare, brief, direct, uninterrupted theorems one
 after the other. (Noether 1914, p. 5)

 Possibly Gordan did not think of anything we would call proofs. He calculated.

 But he offered difficult theorems to show that in any given case these calculations will

 come to an end with a complete set of invariants. The published proofs are opaque,
 and at least one recent attempted reconstruction failed. Gian Carlo Rota worked sev-

 eral years with Joseph Kung on Gordan's method, and they eventually reported "We
 chose to describe and make rigorous [Gordan's] original notation and follow it as

 closely as possible." They succeeded beautifully at that, only to add that they could
 not find rigorous proofs resembling Gordan's: "A similar salvage operation could not,

 unfortunately, be carried out on the proofs" (Kung and Rota 1984, p. 28).

 Primarily two great general concepts lead to a mastery of modern algebra ... the
 concepts of group and field.

 108 C. McLarty

 A second history makes Noether (1916) a gem crystallized from a mass of more

 technical Galois theory. When Noether took up mathematics the paradigm finite groups
 of linear transformations were Galois groups as seen by Dedekind. The prestigious

 textbooks Weber (1895, 1896, 1912) propagated this theory, and the first also pursues

 the project announced by Hubert ( 1 887) at the start of his career to reform invariant the-

 ory by using the new field theory. Weber's account of invariants of finite groups centers
 on a Galois resolvent <P(t) closely related to Noether's <P(z, w).10 This explains why

 the Galois resolvent solution comes first in Noether ( 1 9 1 6). A shorter more elementary

 solution using power sums comes second.

 Weber showed that every Galois field K over the rational numbers has a primi-

 uve element, that is a single element g e K such that every element a € K can be
 expressed as a rational function q(g) of q:

 f(p)

 a = q(o) = -

 h(Q)

 Lagrange's theorem shows this is the same as saying no non-identity element of the
 Galois group leaves q unaltered. This was central to Dedekind-Weber Galois the-
 ory and is proved for example by Weber (1912, p. 258). Weber called the minimal
 polynomial of any primitive element a Galois resolvent (1912, p. 240).

 For any Galois field K over the rational numbers and subgroup ft of its Galois

 group, the fixed field K*> consists of the invariant elements for ft: those x € K such
 that x = Ak(x) for every A* in £j. Lagrange's theorem gives the key relation to resol-

 vents: When 0 is any Galois resolvent of K over a fixed field K*>, then the elements

 of the fixed field K^ are exactly the quantities expressible as rational functions of the

 coefficients of 0. To see this it is enough to consider K as a Galois extension of the

 extension of the ground field k by the coefficients of the resolvent.

 The basic converse Galois problem is to take a finite group S) and find an extension
 of the rational numbers with Galois group S). It is not yet known which groups S)
 admit solutions. Hubert (1892, p. 123) used indeterminate polynomials to relate this
 to rational function fields. Noether stated Hubert's result concisely:11

 Let this equation

 f(x) = xn + Fi(Xi - "kr)xn"1 + • • • + Fn(Xi . . . A.r) = 0

 have Galois group S) over the field Q(A.i • • -Xr) of rational functions of the

 parameters k' - -Xr with rational number coefficients. Then the parameters can

 be replaced in arbitrarily many ways by rational numbers so that the resulting
 polynomial

 10 Noether cited Weber (1899, §57-58), which corresponds to Weber (1896, §41-42).

 1 1 Hubert and Noether both applied this to any "number field" Í2, by which they mean any subfield of the

 Emmy Noether's first great mathematics 109

 g(x)=xn+aìxn-ì + -..+an=0

 has Galois group ft over the rational numbers. (Noether 1918a, p. 222)

 The theorem does not say which finite groups $) admit such polynomials f(x).

 Noether found a sufficient condition that is still pursued in research today (Swan

 1983). Consider the field Q(Ài . . . kh) of rational functions over Q with one param-
 eter for each element of the group $), and the field of invariants Q(k' . . . kh)^ for

 the action of ft permuting the parameters. Noether's general results show there is a

 finite complete system for these invariants. Her (1918a, p. 226) shows that if there is

 such a basis with all its elements algebraically independent then there is a polynomial
 with Galois group $) over Q(A.i ...kh). By Hubert's theorem, then, this polynomial
 parameterizes many polynomials with that Galois group over the rational numbers.

 The general results center on fields of rational functions invariant under some group

 of permutations of the variables. Noether called these fields "Lagrangesche Gattungsb-

 ereiche" in reference to Lagrange's theorem and Kronecker's Gattungsbereiche}1 But

 permuting variables takes polynomials to polynomials and a rational function

 f(x'...xh)

 g(x'...xh)

 expressed in least terms is invariant if and only if each of f(x' . . . Xh) andg(;q . ..Xh)

 is invariant. So it is enough to study invariant polynomials.

 Noether saw that the key fact on Galois resolvents does not use the special features

 of Galois field extensions. For, let a field be extended by adjoining any finite list of

 quantities x' . . . xn with no equations imposed on the quantities. This yields the ring
 of polynomials over the field in these variables. Let any finite group ft = {A' . . . Ah]

 act linearly on these polynomials in whatever way, not necessarily by permuting the

 variables x' . . . xn. An invariant polynomial is one equal to its own average over the
 group action, and that average is a symmetric function of the transformed quanti-

 (k)

 ties x¡ = Ak(xi). The well-known theorem on symmetric functions shows that these
 invariants are all polynomial functions of the coefficients of any "Galois resolvent."

 According to this history Noether adopts a good bit of apparatus from Weber with-

 out mentioning it. Following Weber (1899, p. 232) a primitive element in this context

 is any quantity f{x' . . . Xh) such that no non-identity element A,- of ft leaves it unal-

 tered; and a Galois resolvent is a minimal polynomial for a primitive element. The

 Hubert irreducibility theorem gives primitive elements by forming an indeterminate
 linear combination of the x¿ :

 -u'x'

 and each parameter u¡ and can be determined in arbitrarily many ways that make the
 result primitive.

 12 Kronecker's term is well explained by Goldstein and Schappacher (2007, p. 82), but Noether's definition
 is not actually a case of it.

 None of this is explicit in Noether (1916). Explicitly she formed the polynomial

 110 C.McLarty

 h

 *(z, ii) = ]' (z + uix[k) + . . . + «„*<*>)

 whose roots are h different conjugates of one indeterminate linear combination:

 She treated the x'k) as distinct variables when expanding the polynomial. Then she
 evaluated them in terms of the original jc¿ and A* to get a polynomial

 h t XT ^ / x a «i an {(<* + al + * * * + an) = h'
 zh h + t XT 2^Gaax...otn{x)zauxx...uan« ^ / x a «i an y a^h j

 where each Gao¿i an (•*) is a polynomial in the original x' ...xn, invariant under the
 action of 9). Conversely, any invariant is a polynomial function of the coefficients
 of the resolvent &(z, u) for some choice of values for u' ... un. So it is certainly a

 polynomial in these Ga ax an (x). The Ga ai an (x) give a finite complete system for ft.

 On this history, Noether first treated the x¡ ' as formal variables for Buchstabenr-
 echnung in order to expand the polynomial &(z, u), and then she evaluated them as

 field elements, but she merged these two steps without comment into one equation. She

 never distinguished them, and she soon abandoned the framework of Lagrangesche

 Gattungsbereiche in favor of rings and modules.

 8 Noether (1916) as moving toward representation modules

 The third history uses ideas that Noether had not clarified for herself in (1916) but

 was already reaching toward, and would soon develop.13 Noether knew the works of
 Dedekind, Frobenius, and Schur cited in Fischer (1915, 1916) and Fischer named her

 as a collaborator on those articles. Though she would first publish the thought years

 later, she already knew that:

 Frobenius developed the theory of hypercomplex systems and their representa-

 tions - especially the representation theory of finite groups - in a unified way.
 It was founded on Dedekind's concept of group determinant.... But Frobenius

 got his conceptually unified and transparent results by toilsome (mühevolle)
 calculations. (Noether 1929, pp. 641-642)

 Her new methods would give proofs as unified and transparent as the results.

 Throughout this section notation not taken from Noether (1916) is based on

 her (1929), especially §15 on representation modules. According to Noether (1929,

 pp. 680, 682) the "usual" (übliche) definition of a representation of a group 9) over a

 13 This reading is particularly inspired by Neusei (2006).

 field K correlates each element i € f) with annxn matrix A¡ over K, so that group

 multiplication in $) corresponds to matrix multiplication of the A,-. Her (1916) used

 a common variant of this where i} was conceived of as a group of matrices A,- in the

 first place.

 briefly below.

 Noether used representation modules to shift attention from matrices to their action
 on the module (today called a vector space) of n-tuples of elements of K. As was to

 be crucial to her mature ideas, she also replaced the group f) by its group ring over K

 (Roquette 2002), but the group ring sheds no light on (1916) and we just mention it

 From this point of view, the quantities x' . . . xn in (1916) are basis elements for a

 module we may call V.14 Noether's key insight in (1916) was to track the action of f)

 on V before performing it, but she failed when she tried to express this by equations.

 She tried to define an «-tuple of transforms x[ , . . . , jc„ for each A* by equations:

 *f°=Za^ forali l</<, (2)

 n

 v=l

 n

 v=l

 which fails. Her argument requires x'k) # x¡j) when k ^ j while it could easily happen
 that the right hand sums are equal when evaluated in V.

 Noether (1916) postpones evaluating the sums in V by taking the x' * collectively

 as basis elements for a new module we name W. Intuitively each x¡® represents a pair
 (A¿, x{) indicating that A* is to act on jc,- but, so to speak, has not acted yet. The group

 $) acts naturally on W with each Aj taking each basis element x¡ to the basis element

 x¡jk' indicating that the product AjAk is to act on jc1' .15

 Noether (1916) could not use distinct modules V and W because at that time she

 had no proper way to relate different modules. She had not adopted the idea of homo-

 morphism which would become central to her heritage.16 Rather than our Eq. 2 above
 which Noether gave unnumbered at the start of ( 1 9 1 6) she should have defined a homo-

 morphism W -> V from W to V making each basis element xf^ of W correspond to
 a sum in V:

 x'k) -► ^a^xv for all 1 < / < n (2r)

 14 Connoisseurs will note the confusion between a basis element jc,- and the */ component of a vector in
 that basis, reproducing the confusion explicit on the Noether (1929, p. 669) for example. Noether and others
 slowly became more precise about this during the 1920s.

 15 Today we would say that W is the tensor product of the group ring of Si (with basis elements A¿) and
 the vector space V (with basis elements jc, ) so W has a basis of formal products A^ ® x, .

 16 Inexplicit ideas of homomorphism occur in Dedekind (McLarty 2006). Frobenius and Schur used the
 term "homomorphism" around 1900 (Curtis 1999, p. 155). It spread when Schur used it in three articles
 in 1924 all reviewed in Zentralblatt by Noether. She used the adjective "homomorph" in (1927a, 1927b).
 Krall, Schreier, and Artin took up the term and van der Waerden (1930) made it standard. As to its history
 in English, it first appears on JSTOR in an 1932 article by Levitzki citing Noether (1929) for the definition.

 The left hand basis element x¡k) of W corresponds to the right hand sum in V. We can
 call this the evaluation homomorphism from W to V.

 Rather than her Eq. 1, Noether should have said a polynomial function f(x' . . . xn)

 on V is invariant if and only if the evaluation homomorphism carries f(x^k)) to the
 original /(jc), for all 1 < k < h, which is equivalent to saying it carries the average
 to f(x).

 112 C.McLarty

 1 h

 Since each term f(x^) in the average depends on just one series of variables x^k'
 every permutation of the series leaves it unchanged. The invariants on V are exactly

 the images of polynomials on W symmetric in the series x^k'

 By the well-known theorem, polynomials symmetric in the variable series jc^ are

 all polynomial functions of the completely polarized elementary symmetric polynomi-
 als in one series. These are finite in number. Applying the evaluation homomorphism

 to these finitely many polynomials on W gives a finite complete invariant base for

 polynomials on V. This argument is rigorous by modern standards and indeed is used
 in Smith (1995) and Neusei (2006).

 9 Noether and history

 Historians have to ask which of these histories recounts Noether's thoughts. Noether

 did not have to ask, and did not have to know. Certainly from 1913 to 1915 she thought

 about symbolic calculation, and about Galois theory, and about modules and repre-
 sentations, and there may be no way to separate the influences. There is no reason to

 suppose she did.17

 Noether was not a historical thinker.18 She assiduously credited earlier work in

 every article she wrote, she was keenly interested in past figures as colleagues, that
 is as sources of currently valuable ideas, and she edited works and correspondence

 by Dedekind (Dedekind 1932; Noether and Cavaillès 1937): but she never regarded
 earlier mathematicians as historical subjects.

 She wrote as a colleague and not as a historian when she said, for example, that her

 conservation theorems "rest on combining formal methods of calculus of variations

 with Lie's group theory" (1918b, p. 235) or that her isomorphism theorem occurs "in
 a somewhat more special form" in Dedekind (Noether 1927a, p. 4 In). She knew these
 remarks wildly understate her advances. Some historians feel she was being modest,

 17 Influenced by Weyl and by the apt semi-historical account in Neusei (2006) the author began by believ-

 ing something like the third history would show Noether converting from Gordan's viewpoint to Hubert's.
 Close reading of Noether (1916) made the first history more plausible, while reading her other articles
 around that time led to the second history.

 18 Her longest historical account is (1929, pp. 641-642) on 30 years of hypercomplex systems, which she
 worked in for 15 of those years. She contrasted different approaches but within each one she described the
 accumulation of theorems and gave almost nothing on developing concepts.

 but we know she was not modest. Her student and later colleague Taussky-Todd ( 1 98 1 ,

 p. 84) says Noether irritated some people by bragging. Rather, she wrote these refer-

 ences to acknowledge colleagues she had learned from, and from whom she would

 learn more - albeit she never met them and they were no longer alive. She was not
 interested in tracking how she changed their ideas.

 The great question about Noether in this period is whether and how she made the

 "transition from Gordan's formal standpoint to the Hubert method of approach", as
 stated by Weyl (1935, p. 206). I have already said she did not. But Noether herself left

 little by way of a comparison of the two men: A footnote in her (1919, p. 140n) cites a

 "direct proof of Hubert's basis theorem by Gordan in 1899. Soon after that, Noether

 and Schmeidler (1920, pp. 3,15) say Gordan's proof generalizes more aptly to their
 problem than Hubert's. Her (1923, p. 178) calls Gordan's calculations "unsurveyably
 vast (unübersehbar)" and notes that they could not prove the finiteness theorem for
 classical invariants in many variables, while Hubert's concise method could. These
 remarks are too thin. A serious account of Gordan's and Hubert' influences on Noether

 will have to be more indirect.

 10 Gordan's student and Hubert's algebraist

 Noether was keenly aware that Gordan produced only a tiny fraction of the mathe-
 matics that Hubert was to produce, and that her dissertation under him led nowhere.

 However, Gordan's lasting influence on her was not in the dissertation or the particu-

 lars of his symbolic method, but in his general approach to concepts and calculations,

 as described below. Later, when talking among friends, she would call her dissertation

 "Mist," "Formelngestrupp," and "Rechnerei": that is crap, a formula-thicket, and mere

 reckoning.19 By then Noether could look back at a string of articles each establish-

 ing a new field of mathematics, and conversations that she never even published but
 which established new methods in topology and algebraic geometry. The dissertation

 was poor indeed in that company. By 1932 it appears that she had completely forgot-
 ten Gordan's symbolic method,20 which makes sense because that method is solely
 adapted to one problem which she had left more than 20 years before.

 The key is to see that, while Noether came to define the Hubert school in algebra,
 hers was not Hubert's own algebra! Hubert's algebra stayed close to classical struc-
 tures like subfields of the complex numbers and polynomials over these fields. He

 used algebraic axioms to isolate the key points for each problem but not to describe
 new more remote structures:

 Hubert's own use of the axiomatic method involved, by definition, an acknowl-
 edgment of the conceptual priority of the concrete entities of classical mathe-

 matics, and a desire to improve our understanding of them, rather than a drive to

 encourage the study of mathematical entities defined by abstract axioms devoid

 of immediate, intuitive significance. (Corry 1996, p. 170)

 19 The first appears in Dick (1981, p. 17), the latter two in Alexandroff (1981, p. 99).

 Gordan on the other hand taught that perfectly concrete calculations, notably

 in invariant theory, can lead far beyond the classical structures and intuitions. He

 made Noether a "formalist," understanding that weird but carefully adapted calculat-
 ing devices can solve problems. So in (1916) she calculated boldly with the poorly

 explained terms x'k' Over the next few years Hubert and Dedekind made her a "logi-
 cian" able to give strict definitions and deductions. That was sadly far from Gordan's

 strength. When she combined those influences, she created representation modules

 and crossed products as calculating tools which graduate students today meet in group

 cohomology.21 They have a reputation for being abstract, and indeed they are abstract

 in the sense of being remote from intuitions about classical structures. Yet they orga-

 nize concrete calculations, most notably in their use in proving Fermaťs Last Theorem

 (Washington 1997; McLarty 2010).

 Gordan and Dedekind both taught that conceptual organization can "predict the
 results of calculations" (Dedekind 1996, p. 102). Contrary to legend Gordan never

 doubted Hubert's finiteness proof for classical invariants, still less did he reject it for

 being merely an existence proof.22 He was probably dismayed at first to have his life's

 work so roundly outdone - but he volubly confessed he had been outdone. He spent

 years using Hubert's ideas to get better calculations and specified in print that he could

 do this only because Hubert had seen "the value for invariant theory of certain ideas
 which Dedekind, Kronecker, and Weber developed for use in other parts of algebra"
 (Gordan 1893, pp. 132-133).

 Gordan would have taught Noether that organization is the art of calculation, when

 calculation means actually getting answers and not merely knowing a way to get them

 in principle. Gordan's Erlanger Programm (1875) stresses the difficulty of improv-
 ing his procedure, which works in principle for binary forms in all degrees, so as
 to make it feasible in practice for degrees greater than 6. The great calculator Gor-

 dan knew perhaps more viscerally than anyone else ever has how every procedure
 for solving a problem necessarily becomes infeasible for large enough cases of that
 problem. Conversely, he knew that organizing ideas without algorithms, as Hubert
 (1889, pp. 450-452) did, may yet radically improve calculations. Gordan's work on
 Hubert's proof produced the basic idea of Groebner bases now central to computa-
 tional algebra.23

 Noether absorbed all this and went beyond. The idea of modules as independent

 structures shows the influence of Hubert and Dedekind, and often came to Noether

 through Weber's textbooks; but abstract algebra in the specific sense of freely forming

 agile new kinds of structures and morphisms unconstrained by classical intuitions yet
 tailored for some specific calculation is not to be found in Hubert's work, and only
 a little in that of Dedekind or Weber. Indeed, it is not really in Noether before her

 (1927a, 1927b)- and it just begins to show in Noether (1916).

 21 See Mac Lane (1988), Basbois (2009).

 22 See fuller arguments on this in McLarty (201 1).

 23 See Eisenbud (1995, p. 367). At the same time Hubert (1893) proved the Nullstellensatz and a crucial
 case of Noether normalization, which with Gordan's work made the classical invariant theorem entirely

 constructive for w-ary forms in all degrees for all n. Even with current computers, though, the problem
 quickly becomes infeasible. See Sturmfels (1993).
