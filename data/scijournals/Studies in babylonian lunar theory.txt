 Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III.
 The introduction of the uniform zodiac

 Abstract This paper is the third of a multi-part examination of the Babylonian math-

 ematical lunar theories known as Systems A and B. Part I (Britton, AHES 61:83-145,
 2007) addressed the development of the empirical elements needed to separate the
 effects of lunar and solar anomaly on the intervals between syzygies, accomplished

 in the construction of the System A lunar theory early in the fourth century B.C. Part

 II (Britton, AHES 63:357-431, 2009) examines the accomplishment of this separa-
 tion by the construction of a successful theory depicting the variations due to lunar
 anomaly in System A and its subsequent adaptation in System B. The present paper
 examines the introduction of the uniform zodiac, necessary for any theory depict-
 ing variations depending on the position of syzygy. It addresses three questions: (1)
 In light of all available evidence, what is the magnitude of the constant term in the
 expression AÀ* = C - 1.3828° Y , describing the difference between the Babylonian
 sidereal longitudes and modern tropical longitudes? (2) What considerations governed
 the placement of the Babylonian sidereal zodiac relative to the fixed stars? (3) When

 Communicated by Alexander Jones.

 John P. Britton - deceased.

 This paper with Parts I, II and their sequels are dedicated to the memory of Asger Aaboe, who securely
 laid the foundations of a deeper understanding of Babylonian lunar theory and introduced me to these
 studies. Much of the relevant research was conducted while I was a Senior Fellow at the Dibner Institute,

 and I am indebted to both the Dibner Institute and Dibner Fund for their generous support. I should also
 like to thank Alexander Jones and John Steele for their careful reading and helpful comments and
 suggestions. Naturally, all remaining errors are my own.

 was the uniform zodiac introduced? To the first question it finds C = 3.20° ±0.1°,

 scarcely different from Huber's (Centaurus 5: 192-208, 1958) estimate of 3.08°, essen-

 tially confirming Huber's result obtained from much less data. For the second it shows

 that accommodating the three asterisms comprising Taurus limited the placement of

 the zodiac to within 3°, while the prominence of half sign multiples among the mea-

 sured intervals between prominent Normal Stars led irresistibly to the choice adopted.

 Finally, it finds that the zodiac was introduced between -408 and -397 and probably
 within a very few years of -400.

 phenomena due to their positions and consequently for the development of mathe-
 matical astronomy. This scale was, of course, the uniform "zodiac" comprised of 12
 LU.MAŠ, abstract "constellations" of conceptually equal length, subdivided into 30

 US and their sexagesimal fractions, and named for the principal constellations through

 which they ran. Centered on the middle of the path in which eclipses occurred, hence

 "ecliptic", the zodiac was modeled on the schematic calendar of 12 ideal 30-"day"
 "months", which dominated astronomical practice from Old Babylonian times to the

 eighth century.

 It also paralleled a time-keeping convention of equal antiquity, in which a day com-

 prised 12 DANNA, a unit of time written as KASKAL.GID2 which literally meant
 "long journey", thence "stage" in a day's march, a large unit of distance, comprised
 of 30 US1 and equal to about 10 km. 1 DANNA - equivalent to 2 of our hours - was

 therefore a unit of time corresponding to2 a distance of 30 US = 1 0 km, whereby a day

 came also to comprise 360 US. The new scale thus had dual antecedents, deeply rooted
 in ancient traditions, which assumed that a circuit - whatever its nature - contained
 360 units.

 The fixed sidereal nature of the Babylonian zodiac was demonstrated half a century
 ago by Peter Huber in an elegant paper entitled "On the zero-point of the Babylo-
 nian Ecliptic" (Huber 1958). In it, Huber deduced the Babylonian longitudes of eight
 Normal Stars (NSs) from sign entries and NS passages reported in pairs of Almanacs
 and NS Almanacs for the same years3 around -100. Three of these overlapped and

 agreed with six longitudes preserved in a fragment of a pre-Seleucid star catalog (BM
 46083) previously published by Sachs (1952), thereby demonstrating that the Bab-
 ylonian zodiac had remained unchanged over the intervening centuries. Combining
 the two sets of data, Huber concluded that for -100, the mean difference between

 Babylonian sidereal and modern tropical longitudes was

 AA£ (-100) = 4;28° ± 0;20°,

 equivalent to

 AA£ (Y) = 3.08° - 1.3828°Y ± 0.33°, (1)

 where Y measures Julian centuries from year 0. For -500 expression (1) results in
 the conveniently nice number,

 which I shall use as Huber's result in the discussion to follow.

 AA£ (-500) = 10.00°,

 Recent papers by Kollerstrom (2001), Jones (2004), and Steele and Gray (2007)
 have confirmed the fixed sidereal nature of the Babylonian zodiac, and Huber's
 estimate of AX* has been widely accepted, although both Kollerstrom (2001) and

 1 The sign should probably to be read GEŠX meaning simply "sixty" since 1 UŠ=60 NINDA = 360 m.

 i.e., the amount of time necessary to cover the distance (at a brisk pace). Interestingly, 5 km/h is described

 in some French military manuals as a standard marching pace.

 Steele and Gray (2007) present evidence of at least modestly different values.4
 Furthermore, Roughton et al. (2004) have recently published BM 36609, containing a

 new pre-Seleucid NS catalogue with additional attested longitudes, accompanied by a
 new edition of BM 46083 which changes two of the longitudes used by Huber. Since

 expression (1), or its equivalent, is needed to compare meaningfully Babylonian longi-

 tudes with modern tropical longitudes, an appraisal of the expanded evidence bearing

 on the likely magnitude of AÀ*'s constant term seems desirable.

 This paper addresses three questions. First, what correction, if any, should be applied

 to Huber's estimate of AX^ in light of all available evidence? Next, what consider-
 ations are likely to have governed how the uniform zodiac was placed relative to the

 stars? Finally, when was the uniform zodiac introduced?

 2 Magnitude of AX*

 Evidence of the magnitude of AX* comes from two types of sources with different

 issues and degrees of reliability:

 A. Normal Star (NS) longitudes attested or inferred from various sources

 B. Planetary sign-entry dates reported in Almanacs and Diaries

 In examining each, I have assumed that the Babylonian zodiac was sidereally fixed,
 as demonstrated initially by Huber and placed beyond doubt by the above-mentioned

 authors. Consequently, AÀ* varies with precession over time, reducing the investi-

 gation to determining the magnitude of the potential correction to the constant term
 (8 AX*) in expression (1). For convenience and to reflect circumstances predating the
 zodiac's introduction I have precessed all computed longitudes to their equivalents at

 -500.0, at which date AX^ = 10.00°.

 2.1 NS longitudes

 The standard list of Normal Stars described in Sachs-Hunger (ADART 1, pp. 17-19)
 numbers 32, in addition to which Jones (2004) discusses another 9 occasional refer-
 ence stars for a total of 41. However, Jones also demonstrates a marked difference

 between the frequencies with which 28 "core" stars appear in reports of planetary pas-

 sages and those of the infrequently referenced 13 "additional stars". The latter group
 includes five dispersed asterisms comprising multiple stars for which longitudes are
 cited in BM 36609, but whose locations are diffuse and identifications uncertain. These

 are excluded from the following analysis, which consequently addresses only the 28

 "core" stars identified by Jones (2004) described in Table 1.

 4 Kollerstrom (2001) finds the equivalent of AX*^ = 3.93° - 1.35°r = AA^(0) + 0.85° from an analy-
 sis of 5 Babylonian and 21 Hellenistic horoscopes ranging in date from -234 to +497. Huber's result is
 included with the Babylonian data, but only as a single data point, equally weighted with others having up
 to 10 times the probable error. There are also unexamined issues with the Hellenistic data, so this result
 must be regarded as tenuous. Steele and Gray (2007) analyze 338 sign entry dates recorded in Almanacs

 and Diaries with results that suggest a composite AA|q = 3.22° - 1.23°K = AA.£(0) + 0.14°. Having
 established that AX* varies approximately with precession, however, they do not reanalyze their data with

 a correct value for precession, and recommend adopting Huber's result for AX*.

 Modern coordinates and magnitudes are from SkyMapPro v.8 except for y -Vir (19),5 which are from
 Moesgaard (1976). X* = Àtrop(-500.0) + 10.00°

 With one exception, each of the core Normal Stars is a distinct star with a more or

 less precisely known modern longitude. The exception is (4), the Stars (Pleiades to

 us), which famously comprise seven sisters plus Atlas and Pleione, spread over nearly
 a degree of longitude. Conventionally, and in Table 1, the asterism is identified with

 77-Tau (Alcyone), the brightest and centermost of its members. However, this identifi-

 cation is quite arbitrary and introduces a longitudinal uncertainty of more than half a
 degree6 into any analysis which includes it.

 Table 2 shows the longitudes for which there is some Babylonian evidence, accom-

 panied by indications of source (7) and individual corrections (8 AX*) to Huber's

 AX^ = 10.00°, both simply as 8 AX* = A*ab - À^od (8) and as adjusted (10) for
 major alignment errors (9) as estimated by Jones (2004, p. 501) at mean latitude of

 5 For reasons which remain obscure SMP coordinates for y -Vir are sensibly different from those from
 other sources.

 6 Arguably as plausible would be associating the Pleiades with its leading member, 17-Tau, 0.58° to the
 west of rç-Tau.

 Each has its own issues and characteristics.

 (a) PJH longitudes. Huber (1958) used 8 longitudes inferred from Almanac and NS

 Almanac data in his determination of AÀ^. Notably, they included all three stars,
 £-Tau (7), jö-Gem (12), and ¿-Cap (28), whose longitudes define sign bound-
 aries. In addition to its positional uncertainty, noted above, the Pleiades (4) appear

 affected by an error resulting from alignment with Ç -Per (À* = 38.4°, ß = 11.0°),
 estimated (Jones 2004, p. 501) to equal -1.53° at the mean latitude of planetary

 passages.

 (b) A/5 longitudes. BM 46083, initially identified and published by Sachs (1952)

 and recently republished with corrections in (Roughton et al. 2004, Appendix A),
 contains longitudes of 6 successive "core" Normal Stars, three of which are also

 among the PHJ stars. Sachs had only a photograph and a partial copy by Stras-
 smaier to work from, and collation resulted in two emended longitudes: 0-Leo
 (17) from "20 A" (=140°) to "22" [no sign] (=142°); and y-Vir (19) from "16"
 to "15" [ABSIN]7. Neither was among the longitudes deduced independently by

 Huber, so his conclusion that longitudes remained unchanged over the intervening

 centuries is unaffected. With these changes Huber's analysis would have yielded

 AA.*(- 500) = 10.07°. The longitude of #-Leo is affected by a large error arising
 from alignments with o-Psc (X* = 136.5, ß = 14.2) estimated (Jones 2004, p.
 501) to equal +3.89° at mean planetary passage latitude.

 7 Both emendations, underlined in the accompanying table, are highly plausible. Mostly (ß-Lib in line 5'

 may be an exception) the text cites the sign only for the first longitude in that sign, making 20 A unlikely for

 0-Leo. Placing y -Vir at the mid-point of its sign seems consistent with an apparent preference for multiples
 of 5°.

 (c) PH+ longitudes. Huber (1958) also computed longitudes for five additional stars

 but omitted them from his determination of AA.J, mostly for reasons of too large
 uncertainties.8 The group reflects a distinctively large negative correction to AX*,
 but otherwise is hard to distinguish from those he accepts. I see no good reason

 to exclude any of its members.

 (d) RSW longitudes. BM 36609, identified by Roughton, and recently published in

 RSW (2004) confirms the longitude of ¿-Cap (28) in "pjh" (a) and adds longitudes
 of 8 asterisms. None of these overlap longitudes preserved in BM 46083 and 5

 describe diffuse asterisms comprised of multiple stars of uncertain identity. Nev-

 ertheless, BM 46083 preserves enough traces of additional star names, to show

 that the two "catalogues" addressed the same set of stars.

 However, differences in the two texts suggest that they were compiled when the

 conventional characterization of the zodiac was still unsettled. Most prominently, BM

 36609 describes the zodiacal signs as month-names prefaced with a sign that RSW
 reads as an otherwise unattested MULU4. However, according to Hunger9 this should
 be read as E2 ~ bitu and translated as "place" or "area" as in BM 53282 (Hunger
 1999), referencing the theoretical location of the Sun in the schematic calendar. BM
 46083, in contrast, uses the familiar standard names of zodiacal signs. Another dif-

 ference is reflected in the precision of the longitudes cited in the two texts. In BM

 46083 all 6 preserved longitudes are whole numbers, whereas in BM 36609, 5 of the

 9 preserved longitudes reflect fractional degrees of which 74, 1/3, and V2 are attested.

 8 Huber's analysis suggested that X* (a-Gem) = 84;53° = 85° = X* (ß-Gem)-5° , which seemed implau-
 sibly inconsistent with the actual longitude difference with /S-Gem of 3.27°. This discrepancy, however,
 appears explicable as a result of some "stretching" the longitude of ß-Gem to place it on the sign boundary
 combined with a relatively large passage point correction (-1.36°) arising from alignment with 5-Gem
 (Jones 2004, p. 507). Ziqpu lists also separate a- and £-Gem by AR.A. = AX = 5° (Roughton et al. 2004,
 540 and John Steele, private communication).

 9 Hermann Hunger, private communication, 2009.

 The consistently large positive corrections resulting from all RSW longitudes, com-

 bined with the differences noted above, raise the question of whether these longitudes

 belong with the others, or whether in the early days following the introduction of the

 zodiac there may have been two distinct versions of Normal Star longitudes. Arguing
 against this is the common longitude for ¿-Cap (28) in addition to the evidence that
 both BM 46083 and BM 36609 cover exactly the same stars. Also, as we shall see in

 the next section, the sign-entry data reflects a roughly sinusoidal variation of 8 AX*,

 which peaks in the vicinity of <5-Cap at roughly the same size. As noted in Roughton

 et al. (2004) (554) a relatively large position error in a star such as ¿-Cap would prob-
 ably have affected the position errors of neighboring stars. On balance I conclude that

 the RSW longitudes are part of a common tradition with the rest, although with less
 confidence than I would prefer.

 Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: Part III 625

 Although BM 36609 preserves nine NS longitudes, only four are for core Nor-
 mal Stars, which exhibit a distinctively large positive correction, 8 AX* = 1.52°.
 The rest refer to groups of 3 or 4 stars, whose components are for the most part
 uncertain. Assuming Jones's (2004, p. 483) identifications,10 the average longitudes
 of the component stars of each member yield a nearly identical average correction,
 8 AX* = 1.55°, although with considerably more variation.

 2.7.2 Results

 The mean corrections and related statistics from the longitudes for which there is some

 Babylonian evidence are shown in Table 3 for: all 19 longitudes; 17 longitudes exclud-

 ing the extreme results for the Pleiades (4) and 0-Leo (17); and 14 longitudes excluding

 the Pleiades and 0-Leo plus the 3 RSW longitudes unattested in other sources. Average
 deviations have been used as a measure of variation in place of standard deviations,
 since they are less affected by large deviations.

 The average deviations and extremes of the unadjusted results are sensibly influ-
 enced by alignment errors, but once the outliers are removed, there is little difference

 between unadjusted and adjusted results. In contrast, omitting the unsupported RSW
 longitudes turns a positive correction into a sensible negative one. However, as noted,

 the systematically high values of 8 AX* obtained from RSW stars seem more likely to

 reflect a general error affecting stars in this region of the zodiac, possibly influenced

 Consequently, I see no compelling reason to exclude them.

 Less certain is whether the effects of any alignment errors should be included in

 the correction to AÀj^ from Normal Star longitudes. My inclination is that they should
 be, but there are arguments on both sides of the question. Consequently, I propose to

 accept the unadjusted results from the 17 longitudes excluding the outliers, bolded in

 2.2 Sign-entry data

 Independent evidence of the magnitude of AX* is provided by the dates on which plan-
 ets entered various signs reported in Almanacs and Diaries. The evidence from each
 source was analyzed separately by Steele and Gray (2007) in two-factor regression
 analyses, which showed fairly similar results from the two sets of data and reflected

 temporal variations roughly equal to the rate of precession. In effect the authors used
 some of the information available in the data to demonstrate an approximate corre-

 lation with precession. The following analysis extends this investigation to obtain a
 more secure estimate of the constant term in expression (1), using the known rate of

 precession to precess the computed longitudes for all reported events to the common
 date of -500.0. The procedure also facilitates comparing the sign-entries reported in
 Almanacs and Diaries, which turn out to have few distinguishing characteristics.

 Babylonian dates of 245 planetary sign-entries reported in Almanacs were kindly
 furnished by Hermann Hunger and converted to Julian dates using P.V. Neugebauer's
 visibility criteria incorporated in Peter Huber's CRESDAT11 program. Planetary

 longitudes were calculated in accordance with Bretagnon's theories for evening
 phenomena at 7 p.m. in Babylon (16 h UT) and for morning phenomena at 5 a.m.
 (2 h UT). These were precessed to -500.0 and compared with the beginning longi-

 tude of the designated sign, or ending longitude if the planet was moving retrograde,

 to find AÀ*(-500)i for that record, from which SAkf = AAf - 10.00°.

 The reported data and computed longitudes for -500.0 are shown in Appendix

 B. Three records [marked "x"] exhibit gross errors and have been excluded from the

 analysis. Ten other day-dates [marked "d"] are questionable readings, the appropriate-

 ness of whose inclusion is debatable. Records marked "r" involve retrograde motion,

 where the planet enters the sign at its upper boundary. Planets are designated by their

 initials, except for Mercury which is designated as "E" to distinguish it from Mars

 ["M"]. Finally, "e" and "m" indicate whether the associated longitude is computed for

 evening or the following morning. The record dates range from -164 to +74, with an
 average date of -55.

 Similar data are presented in Appendix C for 104 sign-entries reported in Diaries,

 collected by Steele and Gray (2007) and kindly furnished by John Steele. Two gross
 errors ["x"] have been excluded from the analysis, and "r", "e", and "m" connote
 retrograde, evening and morning as above. Record dates are somewhat earlier than for

 Almanac records, ranging from -212 to -72 with an average date of -127.

 Table 4 presents the results of the analysis. Records with gross errors have been
 excluded, and Almanac records have been analyzed with and without questionable
 day-dates. Results from Diary records reflect slightly larger average deviations than
 Almanac records but not sensibly greater extreme deviations. On balance, there seems
 no significant difference between the two sets of records and thus no reason not to

 combine them as in the last two columns. I consider the results excluding questionable

 dates more reliable, but recognize the subjective nature of this judgment. On balance
 I find from sign-entry records.

 SAX^ (sign entries) = +0.13° ± 0.07°. (3)

 Table 5 shows that retrograde sign-entries were recorded or estimated slightly earlier
 on average than the far more prevalent direct motion records, but with smaller variabil-

 ity (avedev) and much smaller extreme deviations. On balance, however, retrograde
 sign-entries are largely indistinguishable from the rest.

 The combined records of direct motion sign-entries, excluding questionable day-
 dates, have an median date of -81. The reduction in average deviation from earlier to
 later records suggests slight improvement in consistency of estimation, which, how-
 ever, is not supported by a corresponding decrease in extreme deviations or a sensible

 difference in ÀÀ*. All in all no sensible change in methodology with time is evident
 from these records.

 Table 6 presents the results for individual planets, which though not directly rel-

 evant to the present inquiry are nonetheless of interest. Venus accounts for nearly
 half the records with Mars and Mercury accounting for the lion's share of the rest.

 Especially notable is the apparent correlation of variability, as reflected in average,
 standard, and extreme deviations, with planetary speed. This suggests that errors derive

 3 Placement of the zodiac

 How were the longitudes to the Normal Stars established12, and what considerations

 are likely to have governed this process? A general consideration was obviously that

 the individual signs should bear some proximate relationship to their eponymous con-

 stellations, which vary considerably in length and are unevenly distributed around the

 ecliptic. Another requirement and likely starting point would have been a set of mea-

 sured intervals among Normal Stars, summing to 12 signs or 360°, and thus reducible

 to a set of intervals relative to any Normal Stars whose assigned longitude would then

 determine the rest. Previously13 I suggested with Christopher Walker (Britton and

 Walker, 1996, 49) that the principle governing the placement of the zodiac was simply

 placing jö-Gem at the boundary between Gemini and Cancer, equivalent to 90° by our

 counting, from which the rest would have followed from observed intervals. However,

 while this was clearly a result and may have influenced the process, /?-Gem turns out

 not to have been a key reference star and principal determinant of the placement.

 3.1 Conjectured longitudes

 Before examining the intervals between Normal Stars, it will be helpful/useful to con-

 sider the longitudes of the 9 stars for which there is no direct Babylonian evidence.

 12 This question is sometimes framed as an attempt to explain the "zero-point" of the zodiac, an effort
 frustrated by the absence of a prominent star near the beginning of Aries. In fact the "zero-point" of the

 Babylonian zodiac is a modern artifact, the Babylonian zodiac being simply a serial set of 30° signs, which
 began with Aries (Hun, Lu) because the civil year began after the spring equinox, thought at the time to
 occur when the sun reached Aries 10°.

 13 As noted by Kollerstrom (2001, 145 n2).

 The most likely possibilities are shown in Table 8, based on their respective side-

 real longitudes reflecting ¿AA^ = +0.12° as found above, and rounded to whole
 degrees influenced by one or more considerations listed under "Notes". Two consider-

 ations are simply rounding to either or both of the nearest whole degree or the nearest
 multiple of 5°. The other, described as "some Greek evidence", requires additional
 comment.

 As Kollerstrom (2001, p. 147) notes, Cleomedes remarks (De Motu 1,1 1 plO6:25-
 108:5, HAMA 960) that a-Tau and a-Sco are located at the mid-points of their respec-
 tive signs, an assertion repeated by "Anonymous of the Year 379" (CCAG 5, 1 pl98:4f
 and p203:4,16).14 Neugebauer asserts (HAMA, 960) that these must be tropical lon-
 gitudes, effectively dating Cleomedes to around 370 A.D. Kollerstrom rejects this
 assumption, and his skepticism is almost certainly correct, for everything else known

 of Cleomedes suggests a very elementary knowledge of pre-Ptolemaic astronomy
 and possibly a much earlier date. Instead it seems likely that both statements refer

 to the sidereal zodiac, especially since AA.£ places both stars almost precisely at the
 mid-points of their signs.

 Un-remarked by Kollerstrom or others to my knowledge, is supporting evidence

 from none other than Ptolemy, whose star catalogue in Aim. 7 lists the tropical lon-
 gitudes of both stars as 12;40° of their signs. At 137.5 (CE), the epoch of Ptolemy's
 catalogue, Ptolemy's longitudes reflect a systematic error of -1;7°, due to the error

 in his mean solar longitude, traceable to the dates he assumes for contemporary equi-
 noxes and solstices (or alternatively, his assumed tropical year length). For the same

 14 Kollerstrom ascribes a supporting statement to Rhetorius (ca. 500 A.D.) but then notes correctly that
 Rhetorius actually places the two stars at 16;20° of their respective signs, which are obviously tropical
 longitudes.

 epoch SAX* = 1; 18°, so the difference between Babylonian sidereal and Ptolemy's

 tropical longitudes is15

 A4toi (+137.5) = À*ab - Àptoi = 1;18° + 1;7° = 2; 25° £ 2; 20°.

 Thus, taking account of the error in Ptolemy's solar model, the difference between
 Babylonian sidereal and Ptolemy's tropical longitudes rounded to the nearest 0;10°,
 places a-Tau and a-Sco exactly in the mid-points of their signs as stated by
 Cleomedes.

 This unexpected evidence of a correspondence between two of Ptolemy's longi-
 tudes and those from the sidereal zodiac suggests looking at Ptolemy's longitudes for

 all 28 core Normal Stars. These are shown in Appendix A, where longitudes from Ptol-

 emy's star catalogue have been increased by 2; 20° with the resulting differences from

 computed sidereal longitudes shown in the final column. Clearly Ptolemy's longitudes

 are not simply derived from Babylonian sidereal ones. Of the 19 known or inferred

 Babylonian longitudes discussed above, three are the same as Ptolemy's, while for all

 of the rest except Regulus16 Ptolemy's longitudes are improvements, often substantial,

 over their Babylonian counterparts.

 Furthermore, nearly two-thirds of Ptolemy's sidereal longitudes have fractional

 parts, whereas 16 of the 19 Babylonian longitudes so far known are integers, evidently

 reflecting a largely independent procedure of derivation. Nevertheless, Ptolemy's side-

 real longitudes for a- Ari (3), ß-Tau (6), and Ç -Tau (7) each agree with their Babylonian

 counterparts, suggesting that some of his other integer longitudes may have had sim-
 ilar correspondences. Of Ptolemy's seven other integer longitudes three, rç-Psc (1),
 ß-Gem (12), and a- Vir (20), improve upon their Babylonian counterparts. Of the rest
 the longitudes of a-Tau (5) and a-Sco (24) are affirmed by Cleomedes; ß-Ari (2) at
 10° is a natural multiple of 5°, echoing the placement of the spring equinox in lunar

 System A; and /3-Sco (23) at 218° is just what one should expect from typical interval
 errors and its proximity to a-Sco. On balance, there seems no reason to doubt that
 a-Tau and a-Sco were located at the mid-points of their signs, while the other two of

 Ptolemy's integer longitudes seem entirely plausible.

 The conjectured longitudes in Table 8 have an average 8 AX* of -0.02°, insensibly
 different from the result derived above. Moreover, each of the longitudes for which

 there appears to be Greek evidence is supported by one or both natural rounding con-
 siderations. On balance, it seems all but certain that the Babylonian longitudes of

 «-Tau and a-Sco were at the mid-points of their signs, while the other conjectured

 longitudes seem likely, if less than certain.

 15 An alternative derivation, anticipating the result AÀ*(-500) = 10.12°, implying AA*(-128) = 4;58°,
 is to assume that Hipparchus determined AX* (-128) as = 5°, whence AX*>tol(+138)=5;0° - 2;40° =
 2;20°.

 16 Regulus's Babylonian longitude is decreased by a minimal 0; 10° in Aim. 7, where an increase would

 3.2 Intervals

 Table 9 combines attested and conjectured longitudes, omitting the Pleiades and 0-Leo
 as before, and separates them into multiples of 5° and the rest. The former account

 for half (14) of core NS longitudes and half of these (7) are either mid-points or trail-

 ing boundaries of their respective signs. The last three columns of Table 9 shows the

 intervals and their absolute errors between each star and Ç-Tau, an attested longitude

 on the trailing boundary of Taurus. These reflect the same precision as their associated

 longitudes.

 The unnatural preponderance of 5° multiples prompts a suspicion that this may
 have been an arbitrary preference, in which case one would expect such intervals to

 exhibit larger errors on balance than their more precise counterparts. This proves not

 to be the case, however, and in fact the 5° longitudes reflect significantly lower average

 deviations in both 8 AX* and interval errors than the rest. Measured relative to £-Tau

 the average interval error of the 5° longitudes is roughly */4 cubit with an average devi-

 ation of half as large. This is consistent with accurate measurements with a precision

 of half a cubit, which seems likely to be close to, if not at, the limit of realistically

 achievable accuracy. In contrast, the Io and fractional degree longitudes exhibit aver-

 age deviations of SAX* and interval errors 35% and 70% higher, respectively. Thus,
 the 5° and 15° intervals appear to have been a natural occurrence, measured with
 somewhat greater accuracy than the rest.

 Table 10 illustrates the relative accuracy of intervals measured with respect to
 different prominent stars for each of the main precision groupings. In both groups
 the relative accuracy and dispersion of intervals relative to a -Tau, f-Tau, and
 a-Seo are conspicuously similar, with Io longitudes being consistently less accurate
 than 5° longitudes as previously noted. Thereafter, average interval errors increase,
 being slightly larger in both groups relative to a -Leo, similar to Io errors rela-

 tive to y -Gem and larger still relative to ß-Gem, which clearly played no promi-
 nent role in the establishment of the interval grid. Conversely, intervals relative to
 a-Tau, £-Tau, and a-Sco are both the most accurate and essentially indistinguish-
 able, suggesting that these three stars, or one of them, served as the foundation of the

 interval grid.

 Interestingly, the interval errors appear to have been independent of the size of the
 interval measured. This may be seen in Fig. 2, which plots the difference between
 Babylonian and modern intervals as a function of interval size, assuming measure-
 ments from the nearest of either a-Tau or a-Sco. While the Babylonian intervals
 are too short on average by roughly 74°, the negligible slope of the linear trend
 line (-0.0007) and equally negligible R2 value (0.0006), are a striking attestation of
 non-correlation.

 3.3 Constellation boundaries

 The constellations for which the zodiacal signs were named vary considerably in
 size and distribution along the ecliptic, creating a challenge for the author of the
 zodiac to fit the signs to their eponymous constellations. Taurus (comprised of

 MUL2-MUL2, GU4-AN plus GIGIR), Leo (UR-A), Aquarius (GU-LA), are long con-
 stellations extending for more than a sign and thus necessarily into adjacent signs.
 Cancer (ALLA) and Virgo (ABSIN) on the other hand are short, leaving gaps between
 constellations within their signs. Overlaps also occur, most notably by Sagittarius
 (PA), whose bow and arrow overlap the tail of the Scorpion (GIR2 TAB).

 The most likely longitudinal boundaries of the zodiacal constellations are shown

 in Table 11, which ignores the overlapping parts of intruding constellations. We have
 no good idea how the constellation comprising Aries was visualized, either as Hired

 Man (luHUN-GA) or Ram (LU), both of which are attested, but y -Ari and Ç -Ari seem

 likely to define its extent. Taurus encompasses three asterisms - the Pleiades (MUL2-

 MUL2), Bull of Heaven (GU4-AN) extending beyond the Pleiades to the west, and

 Chariot (GIGIR), which together appear to extend from o-Tau (k* = 26.6°) to £-Tau.

 Since o-Tau overlaps £-Ari, the latter is considered the effective boundary in Table 11.
 However, several positional reports17 describe planets as in Aries, which were up
 to 5° within Taurus, which may reflect a convention that the asterism comprising
 HUN and/or LU extended as far as the Pleiades. The Twins (MAS-MAS) appear to

 extend from 1 Gem to k- or ß-Gem whose longitudes are indistinguishable, leaving

 a gap between the Chariot and the Twins of roughly 6°. D-418 describes Venus at
 64° as "behind {ari) the Chariot", thus evidently not yet in the Twins, Hunger 5, 56A
 describes V- Venus at 65° as "in the Twins", and D-418 describes Venus at 69° as "in

 the beginning (ina SAG)" of the Twins, all of which are roughly consistent with a
 beginning around 65° or 66°.

 Following the end of the Twins at k, ß-Gem is another gap of 6° until the Crab
 (Alia) begins, probably with x-Cnc. D-418 describes Jupiter at 94° as "in front of
 (IGI)" the Crab, but "in the beginning (SAG) of the Crab" at 99°. H5, 56B describes
 Venus at 1 1 Io as "in" the Crab, but "behind (ár) it at 1 12°, suggesting that the aster-

 ism extended to /c-Leo. Another 5° gap follows before the Lion (Ur-A) intrudes,

 apparently beginning with e-Leo (SAG A) and continuing through Leo to end with

 jS-Vir.

 Virgo is problematic. ABSIN is conventionally translated as "furrow", although
 Sachs (1952, 146 n3) cites instances where "barley stalk" is meant. In BM 36609
 and conventionally, y -Vir is described as DELE ina IGI ABSIN, "the single star in
 front of the Furrow or Barley Stalk", implying that the asterism ABSIN begins behind
 it. Sachs (1952) interpreted the entry in BM 46083 as the "root (šur-ši) of ABSIN",

 a transcription retained in RSW's new edition of the text. However, Hunger avers18

 that this is simply a misreading of the standard description DELE ina IGI, which

 seems likely. Since ß-Vir is part of Leo and rj- Vir seems part of the (date-palm) Frond
 (Gössmann 1950, 3), it is hard to visualize ABSIN as a linear furrow wobbling from

 0 through a to k, especially since y is considered distinct and "in front" of it. Con-
 sequently, Sachs's interpretation of ABSIN as "Barley Stalk" extending from Spica
 to f -Vir, with roots extending west to 0-Vir (A.* = 163.5°) and (perhaps) east to 82
 Vir (À* = 182.2°) seems likely to be more appropriate than "Furrow". Observational
 evidence is unhelpful; H5, 56B places Venus "in the end (TIL)" of ABSIN at 182°,
 while D-463 places it "behind (âr) AB-SÍN" at the same longitude.

 The Scale (RIN2) is readily recognizable as a scale comprised of a triangular beam
 with a at its apex and ß and a at each end from which hang balance pans, 0-48 and
 v-r, which intrude nearly 5° into Scorpius. The Scale appears to be suspended at
 a from /oVir, leaving a gap of roughly 7° between it and the Barley Stalk. Nearly
 touching the pans of the Scale are the pincers of the Scorpion (GIR2-TAB), another
 easily visualized asterism, which extends through a-Sco to its curved stinger whose
 furthest extent is marked by ¿-Sco. The latter intrudes slightly into Sagittarius and
 is at essentially the same longitude as 3 Sgr, which - ignoring the overlap - can be
 considered the effective beginning of PA who extends to 62 Sgr and intrudes slightly

 into Capricorn.

 There follows another gap of 7° to the beginning of the Goat-fish, which I find hard

 to visualize but appears clearly delineated, evidently beginning with a,ß-Cap (insen-
 sibly different in longitude) and ending with ¿-Cap. The Giant (GU-LA) is another
 sprawling, problematic asterism, which effectively begins with ß-Agr at the same
 longitude as <5-Cap, and apparently intrudes into Pisces with a trailing "Rear Basket"

 placed at 337.5° in BM 36609 and identified by Jones with a quadrangle of faint stars
 around 334°. D-453 puts Mercury ina TIL GU-LA at 334° and Venus ina KUNme at
 335°, so I've assumed the Giant extends to at least 29 Psc in Tables 10 and 11. This

 still leaves a 3° error in BM 36609's longitude of the "Rear Basket", the largest of
 any of the attested Normal Stars, raising a question of whether this might not be a
 scribal error for 334.5. However, D-382 places Mercury ina GU at 337°, which can-

 not plausibly refer to the sign, suggesting that the Giant may have extended as far as

 cd-Psc (À* = 337.9°), in which case the "Rear Basket" may have instead comprised
 the pentagon defined by y, 0, ¿, À, and k Psc.
 The constellation boundaries and extents described above are summarized in

 Table 12, together with their intrusions into neighboring signs. The latter reflect a
 net aggregate positive intrusion (i.e., into the following sign) of +16°. Optimal bal-
 ance would thus entail a shift of 1° or 2° in the direction of lower Babylonian and
 sidereal longitudes and thus AÀ*. Its absence suggests that optimizing the balance
 of constellational placement in a quantitative sense was not a consideration in the
 placement of the zodiac.

 3.4 Placement

 Three NSs - Ç-Tau, ß-Gem, and ¿-Cap - define the trailing boundaries of their con-

 stellations, which sets an upper limit of 30° to their longitudes, if they are to remain

 within the signs named for their constellations. In the other direction, lowering longi-
 tudes by 3° would place the Pleiades - conventionally part of Taurus - at Aries 30°.
 Thus assuming whole degree shifts, only two alternatives to the placement adopted
 would avoid violating one convention or another. Finally, and probably decisively, all

 three of the trailing boundary stars are among those separated from a -Tau and a-Sco

 by multiples of 15° and from a majority of the remaining stars by multiples of 5°.
 Given these measured intervals, and in the absence of any compelling reason to prefer

 longitudes Io or 2° smaller, placing a -Tau and a-Sco at the midpoints of their signs
 and Ç -Tau, ß-Gem, and <5-Cap at the ends of theirs would have been the natural and

 aesthetically compelling choice.

 In summary, the placement of the zodiac appears to have been a consequence of

 keeping both the Pleiades and £-Tau within Taurus combined with the accurate esti-
 mates that of-Tau was separated from Ç -Tau by half a sign and in opposition to a-Sco.

 This made placing a-Tau and a-Sco at the mid-points of their signs a logical choice,
 which also put Ç -Tau, ß-Gem, and á-Cap at the ends of their respective signs thereby

 marking those sign boundaries directly. The rest of the Normal Star longitudes would
 have followed from their measured intervals, which happened to contain an unusual

 number of 5° multiples.

 4 When was the zodiac introduced?

 Diaries and observational reports from the seventh to the early fifth centuries19 typi-

 cally describe planetary positions as either distances from Normal Stars or as being ina

 19 SHI, D-651 and D-567; H5, 52, 54 and 55. H5, 53 is now dated (Jones, 204, 529) to SE 24-27 (-287ff).

 IGI or ari ZN, meaning "in front of or "behind"20 the named zodiacal entity, which is

 unambiguously an asterism, whether a constellation or individual star. Positions within

 constellations are occasionally reported simply as "ma ZN (zodiacal name), but not

 until after -460 do we encounter the more precise internal descriptions ina SAG ZN21

 or ina TIL/qit ZN22", indicating a position within the zodiacal entity but towards its
 beginning or end. Thereafter, such more precise descriptions become increasingly

 frequent.

 In his classic paper on the "History of the Zodiac" van der Waerden (1953, p. 220)
 cites reports in the Diary for - 41823 of planetary positions in the beginnings and
 ends of zodiacal entities as evidence for the introduction of the zodiac before that

 date, citing the opinions of Schnabel, Weidner and Rehm24 that such descriptions
 referred to zodiacal signs and not constellations. Neugebauer endorsed Rhem in the
 first edition of Exact Sciences in Antiquity (1952, pp. 97, 133), but by the second
 edition Weidner had published the text, and Sachs added a note (Neugebauer 1952,
 2nd ed., 1957, p. 140) challenging that conclusion on the grounds that "in front of
 and "behind" must refer to constellations. In Anfänge der Astronomie (1965, p. 124)

 van der Waerden conceded that distinguishing signs from constellations is a "difficult

 question" but insisted that references to "beginning" and "end" must imply signs, and
 citing evidence from reports of Venus observations in BM 45674 (H5-56) placed the
 introduction of the zodiac back to at least -445. Toomer (1968, p. 193) reviewing AA,

 dismisses this conclusion as "based on interpretations of two fifth century cuneiform

 texts which competent Assyriologists (presumably referring to Sachs) reject". Never-

 theless, van der Waerden's opinion gained currency, and new Diary evidence led to a

 general opinion25 that the zodiac was introduced around the middle of the fifth century,

 and probably between -463 and -453. As further, albeit indirect, evidence supporting
 this dating Rochberg (1998) mentions two texts containing calculated longitudes of
 syzygies and planets for dates ranging from -474 to -430, which evidently refer to
 zodiacal signs and seem to lend at least vague support to the argument from terminol-
 ogy implying a mid-century introduction of the zodiac. As we shall see, neither the

 assumption - that ina SAG or ina TIL reliably refer to signs rather than constellations,

 or that calculated longitudes referring to signs are roughly contemporaneous with their

 contents - withstands close examination. Anticipating the discussion which follows,
 the zodiac appears to have been introduced around -400 rather than -450. (Sachs
 was right.)

 20 i.e., in the direction of daily rotation, hence ina IGI = "west"; ari - "east".

 21 The earliest attestation of ina SAG appears in H5, 56B where the first appearance of Venus as morning
 star (O is described as occurring ina SAG RIN2 (in the beginning of the Scales).

 22 First attested in D-453, iv 2' describing Mercury's disappearance as morning star (]T) as occurring ina
 TIL GU-LA ("in the end of the Giant").

 15 ADARTI,D-418(VAT4924).

 24 As reported by Rehm (1941, p. 22), Schnabel apparently told Meissner that zodiacal signs first appear
 in VAT 4924, then unpublished, which Weidner subsequently confirmed in a letter to Rehm. I am indebted
 to Alexander Jones for accounts of these earlier discussions.

 (1998, p. 30 and 2004, p. 130).

 4.1 Reports of planetary positions

 120 reports of planetary positions on specific dates are preserved which range in date
 from -463 to -381. Slightly more than half (63) are earlier than -408, and the bal-

 ance are later than -397. Most concern details of appearances and disappearances, but

 reports of month-end planetary positions from Diaries and of otherwise dated posi-
 tions from one horoscope are also included. Details of each report are presented in
 Appendix D, whose contents are summarized in Table 13. Roughly two-thirds (84) of

 the reports are ambiguous with respect to whether their referents are signs or asterisms

 and thus unhelpful for present purposes. The rest include 14 external references - ina

 IGI, ár, SIG, šaplat ("in front of, behind, below") - whose referents cannot be signs,

 and 22 statements of internal position {ina SAG, ina, ina TlL/qit) of which 18 appear

 to refer to asterisms, but 4 most probably refer to signs.

 The 36 reports which bear on the introduction of signs are collected in Table 14,

 together with two whose terminology is further evidence of this. Here dates in brackets

 [ ] have been emended to agree broadly with the positions described, whose sidereal

 longitudes (À*p) are calculated for the dates in question (rather than for the calculated
 dates of visibility phenomena). The last column characterizes the reports as either

 referring to signs ("S") or not referring to signs ("xS"), accompanied by a very abbre-
 viated designation of the principal reason for the characterization. As explained at
 the bottom of the table these fall chiefly into one of three groups. The most certain
 are the external references, "in front of/behind ZN", marked "*" which make no sense

 in the context of a continuum of signs. A second group, marked "C", are those descrip-

 tions for which the computed positions agree significantly better with constellation

 boundaries than with sign boundaries. Finally, a third group, labeled "c?" pertains only
 to the constellation HUN/LU, which 3 fifth century reports seem to imply extends 3°

 to 5° into Taurus, in conflict, as noted above, with other reports placing its boundary
 around Aries 27°.

 Among the fifth century reports the last three are from two horoscopes published
 by Rochberg (1998, Nos. 1 and 2), whose positional statements have generally been
 considered to refer to signs. However, in AB251 šaplat SI GÍR-TAB evidently refers
 to a star (a -Lib), while the preceding external reference, ina IGI GU, from AO 17649
 must refer to the constellation, even if the computed position of Venus at the time

 places it within rather than in front of the Giant. Requiring more detailed comment,

 is the reading "ar2 SI4" as the position of Mercury in obv. 3 of AO 17649. Follow-

 ing a clear ari is a damaged sign, initially read as ^MAŠ^-MAŠ (Gemini). However,

 as Rochberg notes, Mercury's first appearance as morning star that year occurred at
 k* = 242° across the zodiac from Gemini, and in front of, not behind, MÁS which

 seemed the closest alternative reading. Since the calculated date is within a day of the

 text's, a gross error in position seems unlikely. Reading the sign as a slightly smudged

 SI4, however, for dLisi ~ a-Sco, makes sense of the text, since Mercury's position at

 first appearance would have been on the boundary between the figures of Scorpion and

 Pabilsag, 17° behind a-Sco and not yet clearly within the constellation PA26. Coupled
 with the description of Venus's disappearance ina IGI GU, there appears scant room

 for doubt that the positions given in the text refer to stars or constellations and not

 signs.

 Working backwards within the fifth century reports, a series of referential reports

 from D-418 appear to exclude references to signs. The latest, a position of Venus at the
 end of Darius 2, month XII2 describes Venus, then at 35° or 5° Tau as ina HUN-GÁ.

 The discrepancy is too large to be a plausible reference to the sign Aries, and reflects
 an anomaly encountered elsewhere (e.g., ARTX1 15 I and 23 I) in which the figure
 comprising Aries (alternatively described here and elsewhere in Appendix D as Ram
 (LU) or Hired Man (HUN(-GA2)) appears to extend as far as the Pleiades between 3°
 and 5° into Taurus. Since there are almost no visible stars in the area between 30° Aries

 and the Pleiades, it is hard to understand what is envisaged. However, the repetition
 suggests that it was not accidental.

 Immediately before, are several reports from D-418 which place Saturn or Mercury
 "in the end of Pisces" (ina TlL/qit KUNme) when their calculated positions were up
 to 5° into Aries, but still within the boundaries of the constellation KUNme. Reports
 from the same text of positions of Jupiter and Venus relative to constellations, lend

 further support to the conclusion that as late as -418 positions were reported relative

 to asterisms and not signs. Reports with similar descriptions of positions at 3° or 4°
 of Aries as ina KUNme appear in -445 and -453 by which time relative position (*)
 reports predominate.

 In summary, despite some minor interpretive issues, positional reports prior to
 -408 consistently refer to stars or constellations and reflect no evidence of references
 to zodiacal signs.

 Fourth century reports, in contrast, exhibit a different mix of referents, among other

 differences. First, the frequency of significant reports is sharply lower: 13 of 57 fourth

 century reports compared with 25 out of 63 from the fifth century. More significantly,

 four reports exclude references to stars or constellations, and thus inferentially refer
 to zodiacal signs. The earliest of these describes the disappearance of Mars (£2) in
 -394 as ina TIL ALLA on ARTX2 IV 8. Calculation places Mars at 123° (i.e., Leo
 3°) on that date, and disappearance a day earlier and a degree less. Although the report
 inaccurately places Mars in the end of Cancer rather than at the beginning of Leo, it
 cannot have referred to the constellation Crab, whose furthest extent at 111° it had

 passed 12° earlier before entering the Lion on passing by SAG A (s-Leo) at longitude

 26 In an e-mail, Rochberg affirmed this reading and interpretation.

 116°. Thus, however inaccurately, the report can only refer to the sign Cancer, and is

 the earliest direct evidence we possess for the introduction of the uniform zodiac.

 The next report from -388 (16 ARTX2 IV 27) places the first appearance of Mer-

 cury (F) as morning star ina SAG ALLA, compared with a computed longitude for
 that date of 100° (10° Cnc) and computed first appearance a day earlier at 99°. This

 fits the constellation, which began around 96°, far better than the sign, although the

 latter cannot be confidently ruled out. In the following month of the same year (-388)

 Mercury's disappearance as morning star (£) is reported a occurring ina SAG A on a
 date (16 ARTX2 V 16) when Mercury was at longitude 128° (8° Leo), a day after its

 computed disappearance at 126°. Although further into Leo than the roughly 5° which

 Steele and Gray (2007, pp. 453, 454) found typical of later "ina SAG/TIL" reports,

 this cannot plausibly be interpreted as referring to the constellation Lion which begins

 at least 12° earlier with SAG A. This then is a second report, which must refer to a

 zodiacal sign rather than constellation.

 Two subsequent reports of first appearances in Taurus, by Mars in -387 and Jupiter
 in -384, must also refer to zodiacal signs. In the earlier (-387) of the two reports
 the first appearance of Mars (F) is described as ina MUL2-MUL2 on 17 ARTX2 II
 15 when Mars on that date was at 43° (13° Leo) only 2° short of a-Leo (Is-leio, the
 Jaw of the Bull) and more than 7° beyond the closest of the Pleiades. In the later
 (-384) report the first appearance (F) of Jupiter on 20 ARTX2 II 6 is described as ina
 SAG MUL2-MUL2, when Jupiter at longitude 37° (7° Leo) on that date had already

 passed the last of the Pleiades. Even had it not, the description ina SAG would hardly

 have been applied to an asterism less than l°in extent and included among the NSs.

 These reports also depart from the expected practice of naming signs for their prin-
 cipal constellations by naming Taurus for the Stars (MUL2-MUL2) instead of either
 of its more extensive and traditional referents, Bull of Heaven (GU4-AN) or Chariot

 (GIGIR). Whether in response to the ambiguous boundary between HUN/LU and
 GU4-AN noted above, or to avoid confusion with the name of month II, GU4-UD,

 or some other consideration, it was a distinctive change in practice, unprecedented in

 earlier reports, which was evidently associated with the introduction of signs in place
 of constellations.

 We thus have four reports beginning in -394, which refer to signs rather than
 constellations with negligible uncertainty. Among the rest, four marked "*" continue
 to utilize external referents to stars or constellations, one (-384) places Saturn ina

 GIGIR which can only mean the asterism Chariot, and two (-388 and -381) involve

 positions of Mercury which better fit the boundaries of constellations than of signs.

 Clearly, references to constellations or stars did not disappear from positional reports
 with the introduction of zodiacal signs, although they did become noticeably less

 frequent.

 In summary, positional references to zodiacal signs do not appear in reports before

 -408 but do appear in a report for -394 and continue intermixed with references to
 stars and constellations for the next decade. Between these dates we have only two

 reports, the first being of a first appearance of Mars in -396 "ina A" when Mars was at
 150° (30° Leo) and thus located in both the sign and the constellation, and the second
 in -395 when Mars's second station (vl>) at 336° (6°Psc) is described as "ina zib".

 The significance of these reports, whose referents are otherwise ambiguous, is that

 each is the earliest instance of a change in terminology describing the zodiacal entity

 from the convention used consistently in reference to constellations in reports before

 -408. Thus "A" for Leo, which first appears in the report for -396 and thereafter is
 consistently used in at least six subsequent reports, replaces "UR-A" which is used

 consistently to designate the Lion in pre-408 reports. Similarly, "z/è" and later z/£me,
 Akkadian abbreviations for KUNme (Tails) consistently replace KUNme after -396,

 which otherwise appears exclusively in over a dozen fifth century reports.

 Thus, the introduction of the zodiac appears to have been accompanied by a shift

 in nomenclature distinguishing the signs we know as Pisces, Taurus, and Leo from

 their component constellations. It is probably not accidental that the signs so affected

 encompass constellations that either intrude significantly into adjacent signs (Pisces
 and Leo) or include several asterisms as in Taurus with uncertain boundary issues.
 Whatever the reason, the change in terminology reflected in the first two fourth cen-

 tury reports in Table 14, nudges the earliest evidence for the introduction of the zodiac

 back a couple of years to -396, leaving an evidential gap from -408 to -397.

 Table 15 summarizes the evidence from reports of planetary positions, indicat-

 ing that the uniform zodiac was introduced between -408 and -397. No evidence of

 signs is present in fifth century reports, while both direct evidence of signs and indirect

 evidence from terminology appear in the earliest fourth century reports.

 4.2 Other evidence

 As Rochberg notes, several texts from mathematical astronomy contain computed
 longitudes of fifth century phenomena, which evidently refer to zodiacal signs and
 could be potential evidence of an earlier introduction of the zodiac. The earliest of

 these, sometimes known as Text S27, contains calculated longitudes of conjunctions
 and associated 4>-values (among other computed quantities) for 38 solar eclipse pos-

 27 BM 36599 and its duplicate BM 36737+36850+47912 published in Aaboe and Sachs (1969, Texts B
 and C+D), and Aaboe et al. (1991, Text G), discussed as "Text S" in Britton (1989) and Aaboe et al. (1991,
 43 n 24, pp. 69-71.)

 sibilities from -474 to -456. Column 0, however, was constructed certainly after
 -403 and probably after -40 128, so the text must have been written after one or

 both of these dates. Another text29 contains a primitive scheme describing longitudes

 of Venus over a synodic cycle, probably beginning 8 Darius II (- 415/4)30, but also
 4>-data and descriptions of Greek Letter phenomena for Mars from the mid-fourth

 century. Thus the text itself clearly dates from the fourth century and while the Venus

 section is probably a copy of earlier work, nothing suggests that it is contemporary
 with its contents31 and consequently evidence of the introduction of the zodiac. A

 third text with computed longitudes from the fifth century is BM 36651 (Aaboe et al.
 1991, Text E). The obverse (Text "M") contains three columns of year-numbers and

 longitudes of disappearances of Mercury as evening star (Œ) from 41 Artaxerxes I
 (-415) to 2 Artaxerxes II (-401) computed according to system A3 (BM 36321,ACT,

 8 1 632 ) . The reverse (Text "L") contains longitudes and nodal elongations of full moons

 for 2 saroi of lunar eclipse possibilities from 7 Darius II (-416/7) to 24 Artaxerxes II

 (-380). Thus with the possible, but unlikely, exception of the crude Venus scheme for
 -415, all of the mathematical astronomical texts containing fifth century longitudes

 reflecting a uniform zodiac were composed after -401 and offer no evidence of its
 earlier introduction.

 28 Column <í> was anchored to the full moon sy zy gy on -403 Aug 1 8 (GN 739 1 ), which ended the shortest

 6-month interval between lunar eclipses since the reign of Nabonassar. Its construction also assumes a mean
 value for the synodic month (Britton ,1987, 1990, 1999 and 2009, 386, 397ff.) seemingly derived from an
 estimate that 4267m = 126007d (Britton 2002, pp. 37-39 and 2007, pp. 1 16-120) based on lunar eclipses
 separated by this interval. If systematic records of lunar eclipses (Steele 2000) began with the eclipse in 0
 Nabonassar XII 14 (-746 Feb 6), the first eclipse which would have permitted an estimate of this interval
 occurred on 2 Artaxerxes II XI 14 (-401 Feb 2).

 29 BM 36301 published in Neugebauer and Sachs (1967) as Text C with further commentary in Britton

 and Walker ( 1 99 1 , pp. 1 1 2-1 1 3).

 30 Neugebauer and Sachs suggest -431 and -423 as most probable dates for the text's Venus scheme,
 and Britton and Walker (1991, pp. 1 12-1 13) propose -423. The text's data for O and S, however, agree
 best with -415.

 3 1 More likely it was a (not very competent) theoretical exercise anchored to a rare observation of a second
 station of Venus from an earlier period.

 32 ACT pp. 425-^28. Excursus. According to its colophon (ACT p. 24, Zu) the text was written by Bel-
 apla-iddina, son of Mušallim-Bel and descendent of Mu-še-zib, who authored a Diary for -321 and BM
 33552, a fourth century scheme for Venus (Britton and Walker, 1991, pp. 1 10-1 12). Presumably this is the
 same Bel-apla-iddina described as the father of Marduk-šapik-zeri and grandfather of Iddin-Bel, scribe of
 BM 37266 (Atyp F), BM 36722 (Atyp K), BM 41004 (Atyp E), BM 33801 (ACT 811), and MNB 1856
 (Atyp H). The last text describes entries of Mars into zodiacal signs explicitly as "for 5 Philip (-317)" in
 agreement with calculation. A Bel-apla-[. . .] was the father of Uballissu-Bel, author of a Diary for -361 . If
 these were all members of of Musezib's patriarchal line, the most compact genealogy would encompass 6

 generations from Mušezib (420-380) to Iddin-Bel (320-280), place Mušallim-Bel and Uballissu-Bel in the
 same generation (380-340), have MNB 1856 written not long after its contents near the start of Iddin-Bel's
 career and place Bel-apla-iddina (II) towards the end of his career when he wrote D-361 "for his good
 health". A large number of these texts, including BM 36651 are from the unique archive accessioned by
 the BM on June 17, 1880, which was excavated by Rassam in the fall of 1879 from a house on the inner

 city wall close by the southwest corner of the Esagila complex (Reade 1986, xix). Many of them, including
 BM 36651, are also copies combining unrelated elements of older texts, reflecting an archival activity on

 the part of family members.

 Fig. 3 Solar model errors

 4.3 BM 36822

 A text that does shed light on the issue is BM 36822 (Aaboe and Sachs 1969, Text

 A), which presents a variety of data for successive new moons during years 6 and 7
 of Artaxerxes II (-397). The text has many unusual elements, which I shall discuss

 more fully in a subsequent paper. For now what is of interest is its unique scheme for

 the longitude of conjunction, which reflects the methodology of System A, but with

 different parameters, to wit:

 n = 12,23 (743) months = 1,0(60) years;

 thus 1 year = 12; 23 months

 wi = 30°/m; w2 = 28;30°/m;

 w2/wi = 17/18; Solar apogee (A) = 81; 15°

 The scheme is the earliest example we have of a system A scheme in lunar theory,
 by nearly a century. It differs from the standard scheme chiefly in its period, which is
 convenient, but remarkably inaccurate, and the ratio 17:18 of its velocities and under-

 lying intervals. Otherwise it parallels the standard scheme precisely in methodology
 and interestingly closely in the longitude of its effective apogee (A).

 The text's longitudes, shown in Table 16, confirm its dating, established tentatively
 by Aaboe and Sachs (1969) from accompanying <ï>- values, but with the caveat that
 these were inconsistent with the normal correspondence between O-values and dates

 by 2 and 3 months on obverse and reverse respectively. However, as may be seen
 in Figure 3, the scheme's ("Sys A2") average error grows at the rapid rate of 4° per
 decade, ruling out any realistic possibility of an alternative date. Furthermore, the

 scheme's individual longitudes, whose errors are shown in small squares along the
 Sys A2 trend-line, are remarkably close to System A's whose average error intersects

 with Sys A2 barely a year earlier. All these suggest that the text was probably com-
 posed not more than shortly after the date of its contents, by which time the zodiac

 must have been in place. This would seem to confirm the existence of the zodiac by
 at least -396 and probably somewhat earlier.

 We thus have converging evidence from reports of planetary positions, zodiacal
 nomenclature and orthography, and the A2 longitude scheme in BM 36822 that the

 used by the author of System A to anchor the theory of lunar anomaly to specific

 syzygies by linking that syzygy to the O-value (2, 8; 53, 20uš |) associated with
 the minimum of W, the function describing the variation of 6 months due to lunar

 anomaly.

 ing planetary positions as in E2 ltuMN (month name) similar to the convention

 - 401 Jan 18 (2A ARTX2 X 28 = GN2 7048.5): the only total (magnitude 1.04), non-

 annular, solar eclipse visible at Babylon since before -746. At mid-eclipse Mercury
 was just past superior conjunction 7.3° east of the sun and Venus was 12.3° west
 of the sun. Unless obscured by weather this had to have been a dramatic event. The

 next such eclipse occurred in -135.

 33 Published in Hunger (1999). Brown (2005) notes five implicit birth-dates and proposes the date lOu
 ARTX2 for the latest birth-date in place of 16U assumed by Hunger on the evidence of BM 36910. Com-

 putations suggest reading month VI for the damaged month in obv 1. The text contains planetary and lunar
 positions for five birth-dates ranging from 2A ARTX2 (-401) to lOu ARTX2 (-394), the latter reflecting a
 hitherto unattested instance of a VI2 intercalation (contra BM 36910). Positions of the moon and planets are

 described as "ina E2 MN (month name)", as in BM 36609 and clearly refer to uniform signs which reflect
 the same norm and implicit AÀ* as the Babylonian sidereal zodiac generally. Thus there appears to have

 been an alternative, perhaps competing, terminology for describing zodiacal signs, based on the underlying
 schematic calendar, which persisted until at least -394.

 In short, within the interval in which the zodiac appears to have been introduced we

 have: the earliest horoscope indisputably utilizing uniform signs; followed a few days
 later by an unprecedented and dramatic total solar eclipse 1-3 days later; followed

 by the construction of column <I> and the theory of lunar anomaly in System A; and
 finally a lunar eclipse in -397 in which the moon's center at mid-eclipse was V20
 directly above the NS 0-Oph, for which the longitudes computed by Systems A, A2
 and modern theory are in suggestively close agreement.

 In conclusion, the zodiac could have been introduced at any time during the eviden-

 tial gap from -408 to -397. It is not impossible that its introduction was motivated by

 the development of individual horoscopes near the beginning of this gap. However, it

 seems more likely that its introduction was related to the flurry of activity and events
 between -401 and -397, possibly triggered by the total solar eclipse early in -401,

 and including the invention of elements of the System A lunar theory which required
 a consistent scale for the calculation of positions. On balance, the uniform zodiac
