 Abstract Some variants in the materials related to the planetary latitudes, including

 computational procedures, underlying parameters, numerical tables, and so on, may

 be addressed in the corpus of the astronomical tables preserved from the medieval

 Islamic period (zij literature), which have already been classified comprehensively by

 Van Dalen (Current perspectives in the history of science in East Asia. Seoul National

 University Press, Seoul, pp 316-329,1999). Of these, the new values obtained for the

 planetary inclinations and the longitude of their ascending nodes might have something

 to do with actual observations in the period in question, which are the main concern

 of this paper. The paper is in the following sections. In the first section, Ptolemy's lati

 tude models and their reception in Islamic astronomy are briefly reviewed. In the next

 section, the medieval non-Ptolemaic values for the inclinations and the longitudes of

 the nodal lines are introduced. The paper ends with the discussion and some conclud

 ing remarks. The derivation of the underlying inclination values from the medieval

 planetary latitude tables and determining the accuracy of the tables are postponed to

 "Appendix" in the end of the paper.

 1 The Ptolemaic latitude models and their reception in medieval Islamic

 astronomy

 In the Ptolemaic latitude theory for the superior planets in the Almagest (Fig. la), the

 eccentric is inclined to the ecliptic at a fixed angle io which is equal to 2; 30° for Saturn,

 1 ; 30° for Jupiter, and 10 for Mars. The centre of the epicycle revolves on the eccentric

 in the direction of increasing longitude, reaches the northern and southern limits1 at

 opposite locations on the ecliptic, and crosses it at the nodes. The epicycle itself is

 inclined to the eccentric with its perigee at the same direction as the eccentric, but at

 a varying angle i\. i\ is minimum and equal to i'o when the centre of the epicycle is at

 the nodes and reaches its maximum when the centre of the epicycle is located at the

 limits: iι max = 4; 30° for Saturn, 2; 30° for Jupiter, and 2; 15° for Mars. The direction

 of these inclinations is fixed with respect to the planets' apsidal lines. LATN shows the

 longitudinal difference ω a between the apogee A and the northern limit Ν, which is

 equal to +50° for Saturn, —20° for Jupiter, and 0° for Mars. The model in the Handy

 Tables (Fig. lb) is as same as in the Almagest with the exception that i\ is fixed at the

 same values in the Almagest, and that ω\ = +40° for Saturn, a value less precise than

 that in the Almagest. In the Planetary Hypotheses (Fig. lc), i'i is fixed, but equal to î'o,

 that is, the epicycle always remains parallel to the ecliptic. The inclinations are equal

 to i'o in the Almagest/Handy Tables, with an improvement in the case of Mars where
 i'o = ii — 1;50°.

 The Ptolemaic model for latitude of the inferior planets is shown in Fig. 2a for Venus

 and Fig. 2b for Mercury. Ptolemy observed that the distance u>\ from the apogee to

 the northern limit of the eccentric is 0° for Venus and +180° for Mercury while they

 should be -10 and+196°, respectively, at his time. He also observed that the eccentric

 of the two planets is always inclined to the ecliptic in one direction, Venus to the north

 and Mercury to the south. This inclination is varied: when the centre of the epicycle

 is at either of the apsides, it reaches its maximum, i'o max = +0; 10° for Venus and

 -0;45° for Mercury, but when the centre of the epicycle is ±90° from the apsidal line,

 i'o = 0°. Consequently, Ptolemy defines a conventional position for the nodal line of

 the eccentric ±90° from the apsidal line. Next, when the centre of the epicycle is ±90°

 from the apsidal line, the diameter passing through the epicyclic apogee and perigee is

 inclined to the ecliptic in the line of sight at an angle i \. This inclination is also varied,

 il max = 2; 30° for Venus and 6; 15° for Mercury. As the epicycle moves towards the

 apsidal line, it decreases until it vanishes at either of the apsides. Then, when the centre

 of the epicycle is in the apsidal line, the orthogonal to the diameter passing through

 the epicyclic apogee and perigee is slanted to the ecliptic across the line of sight at an

 angle 12· The slant is also varied, !2max = 3;30° for Venus and 7° for Mercury when

 the centre of the epicycle is in the apsidal line. As the epicycle moves away from the

 apsidal line, the slant decreases until it disappears at ±90° from the apsidal line. As

 shown in Fig. 2a, b, the directions of the inclination and slant are reversed for Venus

 and Mercury. In the Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses, all three components

 of the latitude are fixed, and the inclination and the slant of the epicycle are equal:

 i'l = i*2 = 3;30° for Venus and 6;30° for Mercury and i'o = 0; 10° for both.2

 latitudes (Almagest XIII. 1: Toomer 1998, p. 598).

 Although Ptolemy's latitude models in the Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses
 are simpler and more coherent than those in the Almagest, they nevertheless appear
 to have been of little influence on medieval Islamic astronomers who adhered to

 the latitude models in the Almagest. They had, however, adopted a few elements of

 in Ptolemy's Canobis Inscription seem quite probably to be the same as in the Almagest, but with the excep
 tion of Mars, the sizes of the inclination angles are different (after Jones 2005, pp. 70-73, 89). In fact, the

 text is so bad that one cannot be certain of any differences from the Almagest. From the planetary latitude
 theories presumably prior to Ptolemy, that are referred to in Pliny's Historia Naturalis (II.xiii.66—67: 1938—
 1962, Vol. 1, pp. 212-215), in which only the maximum latitudes are mentioned with reference to a 12°
 ecliptical/zodiacal belt, values are as follows: Moon: ±6°, Mercury: +5°/—3°, Venus: ±7°, Mars: ±2°,
 Jupiter: ±2 y2° or +3°/—1°, Sun and Saturn: ±1° (also, cf. Neugebauer 1975, Vol. 2, p. 782; Eastwood
 and Grasshoff 2003, pp. 203-6; Eastwood 2007, pp. 119-126, 136-137). The pre-Ptolemaic solar model
 having the latitudinal component, in which the sun reaches the maximum latitude of ±0.5°, is discussed in
 Jones 2000. For the planetary latitudes in Babylonian astronomy, cf. Steele 2003.

 the latitude models in the Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses. For instance, the

 extremal values for the latitude of all the planets in the Handy Tables have been applied

 to the Mumtahan Zy (see below, note 18); the maximum values for the latitudes of the

 inferior planets from the Handy Tables/Planetary Hypotheses are also mentioned in

 al-Battànï's Sâbi' Zij and al-Farghânï's Book on astronomy (although both authors do

 not identify their sources);3 the table for the latitude of Venus from the Handy Tables is

 mentioned in Ibn Yilnus' Hakiml Zij (Cairo, d. 1009) (see below). Ibn al-Shàtir of Dam

 ascus (1304-1375/6) discussed how to adapt the latitude theory in the Almagest and

 Planetary Hypotheses to his own planetary model, in which two additional small cir

 cles are incorporated into the epicycle-eccentric mechanism in order that the motions

 of heavenly objects be produced solely by uniform circular motions.4 The equality

 of the maximum values of the inclination and slant of each inferior planet, as in the

 Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses, was used in al-Kâshï's novel method of the

 computation of the planetary latitudes according to the Almagest models (see below).

 The complexity of the Almagest latitude models seems to have been of no concern

 to medieval astronomers, despite the fact that one of Ptolemy's most notable remarks

 on simplicity and complexity in astronomical hypotheses in the Almagest is stated

 in connection with the latitude theory.5 This could give an impression that, since the

 underlying latitude models in the Handy Tables/Planetary Hypotheses are simpler

 than those in the Almagest, they might be preferable. But instead they followed the

 Almagest models with some attempt to remedy them in some aspects, as will be

 mentioned briefly below.

 In the observational aspect, the Middle Eastern Islamic astronomers seem also to

 have possessed some persuasive observational evidence of problems with the planetary

 latitudes in some specific zijes; nevertheless, such criticisms had been directed to the

 adopted parameters, numerical tables, and so on, rather than to the models themselves.5

 3 Cf. NalUno [1899-1907] 1969, Vol. l,p. 116, Vol. 3, p. 175;al-FarghânïXVIII, 1969 pp. 73-4, P: fol. 67r:
 Al-Farghànî gives the rounded values to the nearest 0;20° = l/° for the maxima of the latitudes: ±3° for

 Saturn, ±2° for Jupiter, +4 x/° and -7° for Mars, but he specifies that for Venus it is 6 x/° in the Almagest

 and 9° in the "sources other than the Almagest", and gives 4l/° for Mercury, which is indeed equal to that
 in the Handy Tables/Planetary Hypotheses. Such a mixed tradition can be found in the Andalusian section

 of Islamic astronomy, e.g., in the Muqtabis Zij of Ibn al-Kammâd (12th et.) (cf. Chabâs and Goldstein 1994,
 p. 32).

 4 Cf. Roberts 1966.

 5 Almagest XIII.2: Toomer 1998, p. 600. The two others are mentioned in III.l and ΠΙ.4 (Toomer 1998,

 pp. 136,153). These passages have been rendered faithfully into Arabic (cf. Arabic Almagest, S: fols. 29r,
 34r, 212r; PN: fols. 32v, 161v).

 6 For example, 'All b. Amâjûr's criticisms of the planetary latitudes as computed from the Mumtahan Zij

 (see below, note 18) or Wâbkanwf s claim that the directions of the observed latitudes of the interior planets

 are opposite to what are derived from his contemporary zïjes (Wâbkanawï, Τ: fol. 2v, Y: fol. 3v, Ρ: fol. 3v.

 About Wâbkanawï, cf. Mozaffari 2013a). Of the criticisms of other kinds, it is worth noting Ibn Yflnus'

 severe critical remarks on Habash al-Hàsib's (d. after 869) knowledge of the Almagest latitude model for

 the inferior planets (cf. Habash, fols. 63v-65v; Debamot 1987, p. 54) as well as his berating al-BattânTs

 understanding of how the direction of latitude of Mercury should be determined in the Almagest model

 (Ibn Yiinus, L: p. 4; Caussin 1804, pp. 53, 55). Factually, in the rules set forth in chapter 47 of the Sabi'

 zij, the directions given for the slant component of latitude of the inferior planets are diametrically opposed
 to what should be taken into account according to Almagest XIII.6 (Toomer 1998, p. 635); corrected in
 Nallino [1899-1907] 1969, Vol. 3, p. 175.

 S. M. Mozaffari

 In the philosophical aspect, the following are worthy of consideration: in the lat

 itude models in the Almagest (XIII.2),7 Ptolemy embedded small circles that were

 responsible for rotating the endpoints of the diameters of the epicycles in order to

 account for their variable inclinations. Some spherical versions of the Ptolemaic mod

 els were proposed in Islamic astronomy in order to remove the small circles and give a

 philosophically justified physical model for the latitudinal tilting of the epicycles: Ibn

 al-Haytham (965-ca. 1040) utilized two contacting concentric spheres with different

 poles whose distance is equal to the maximum inclination or slant of the epicycle, and

 rotating in opposite directions with the same velocity as the centre of the epicycle of the

 planet as seen from the earth.8 Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201-1274) deployed three con

 centric interconnected spheres, two of them producing the geometrical device known

 as the "Tûsï couple", to solve the difficulties arising from Ptolemy's small circles.9

 In the mathematical aspect, it merits mentioning that a geometrical spherical ver

 sion of the latitude models in the Almagest was proposed by Jamshid Ghiyâth al-Dïn

 al-Kâshï (1380-1429); although apparently influenced by al-Tusi, it was essentially

 intended to improve upon the mathematics of the models.10 As mentioned above, it

 uses a distinct feature of the Ptolemaic latitude models in both the Handy Tables and

 Planetary Hypotheses that the extremal values of the inclination and slant of each

 inferior planet are equal.11 Al-Kâshï also presented two-argument tables for deriving

 longitude and latitude; dispensing with lengthy computational procedures, a practi

 tioner only needs enter them with the adjusted eccentric and epicyclic anomalies to

 derive the ecliptical coordinates.12 Another example is this: in the Almagest models,

 the slant component of the latitude of Mercury from the tables should be corrected

 such that when the planet is in the apogeal half of the eccentric, one-tenth of the slant

 is subtracted, and inversely, when the planet is in the perigean part of the eccentric,

 the same amount is added. Muhyî al-Din al-Maghribï rectified the procedure,13 and

 Wâbkanawi later commented upon al-Maghribi's method and improved it in the man
 ner that the amount of the slant itself should be multiplied by the absolute value of

 the cosine of the planet's eccentric anomaly;14 over one century later, Kâshi instead

 proposed a new interpolation function in order to calculate the slant component of the

 latitude of Mercury, by means of which there is no need to include this correction.15

 10 Cf. Brummelen 2006, esp. pp. 357-8.

 11 Cf. Brummelen 2006, p. 360. Al-Kâshï uses the Almagest maximum value of the slant of each inferior

 planet for its maximum inclination as well; i.e., ij max = !2max = 3'< 30° for Venus, as is in the Handy

 Tables and Planetary Hypotheses, and i ι max = 12 max = 7;0° for Mercury while the Handy Tables and

 Planetary Hypotheses have 6; 30°. Al-Kâshï states (10: fols. 102v, 103v, 106r) that this is what the moderns

 have found through new observations, which seems to be a conclusion derived from examining the latitude

 tables in the zïjes of the Maragha tradition (see below, Sect. 2).

 the sun, moon, Jupiter, and Venus, and those for the latitude of the inferior planets are available.

 Despite all the above-mentioned refinements, the most important alternatives to

 Ptolemy's planetary latitude models during the medieval period were Indian models.16

 They were adopted in some zljes of the early ninth century such as al-Khwàrizmï's
 Sindhind Zij (ca. 840)17 and Yahyâ b. Abî Mansûr's Mumtahan Zij (ca. 832),18
 and were later passed to the Western Islamic astronomical tradition (the Maghrib
 and Andalus) through al-Khwàrizmï's Zij; e.g., in the Toledan Tables19 and Ibn
 Άζζϋζ al-Qusantïnï's Muwafiq Zij (d. 1354).20 The only medieval astronomer who
 proposed latitude models different from Ptolemy's is apparently Levi ben Ger
 son (1288-1344), who supplied computational procedures and numerical tables as
 well.21

 Among the equatoria invented in the late Islamic period for finding the ecliptical

 positions of the heavenly objects, al-Kâshï's instrument for computing the plane

 tary latitudes may be worth mentioning.22 However, because of the smallness of

 the inclinations, such a device could probably be in use only for demonstrational

 purposes.

 2 The values for the inclinations and ω\ in medieval Islamic astronomy

 In the late Islamic period, there was a great deal of systematic planetary observations

 to determine their underlying parameters while in the early Islamic period the inves

 tigation was of solar and lunar motions. The new values for planetary inclinations

 and longitudes of ascending nodes are found in the zljes written in association with
 the well-known Islamic observatories established at Maragha (ca. 1260-1320 AD),
 Beijing (ca. the 1270s), and Samarqand (ca. 1430-1449).

 16 Although the Indian models are inferior to Ptolemy's, nevertheless, they have two distinct features: the

 eccentrics of the inferior planets coincide with the ecliptic and the epicycles of the superior planets are
 parallel to the ecliptic (cf. Kennedy and Ukashah 1969).

 17 Cf. Neugebauer 1962, pp. 34-40; Kennedy and Ukashah 1969.

 18 The Mumtahan Zïj was later revised by some astronomers working in Iraq and Damascus up to about

 the mid-ninth century, although the manuscripts preserved probably go back to a recension made in the

 tenth century (see Van Dalen 2004a, esp. p. 11; Mozaffari 2013b, pp. 328-9). For the planetary latitudes,

 the following elements have been adopted in this zïj'· the Indian values for the longitudes of the ascending

 nodes, Ptolemy's values for the extremal latitudes as tabulated in the Handy Tables, and a simple sinusoidal

 function, seemingly influenced by the Indian latitude models (see Viladrich 1998, esp. pp. 264-6; Kennedy

 1990, pp. 173-7). As Ibn Yunfls (L: p. 100;Caussin 1804, pp. Ill, 113) states, 'Allb. Amâjflr found some

 errors in the latitudes of the planets and their directions with respect to the ecliptic as calculated from the

 Mumtahan Zïj. The earliest observation Ibn Yflnus reports from the Banu Amâjflr family is the conjunction

 of Regulus with Venus made on 10 September 885 and the latest the lunar eclipse on 4/5 November 933;

 cf. Ibn Yflnus, L: pp. 102, 109; Caussin 1804, pp. 123, 125, 157; concerning the solar and lunar eclipses
 observed by them, see Stephenson 1997, pp. 471-2,479-482; Steele 2000, pp. 116-117.

 19 Toomer 1968, pp. 8, 69-72; Van Dalen 1999, pp. 323-324.

 20 Samsô 1997, p. 92; 1999, pp. 16-17.

 21 Its preliminary philosophical aspects are introduced in Goldstein 2002; also, cf. Glasner 2003. The

 models and their parameters and technical aspects still await further research.

 2.1 Inclinations

 In the Maragha tradition, new values were observed for the inclinations of the epicycles

 of the inferior planets. These are mentioned nowhere and can only be derived from the

 latitude tables. Al-Maghribi explains his own observations and computations made at

 the Maragha observatory for the purpose of determining the solar, lunar, and planetary

 parameters in a treatise entitled Talkhïs al-majisti (Compendium of the Almagest).

 Nevertheless, since the last two books, IX and X, of this treatise are unfortunately

 missing from its only surviving manuscript, which is in the author's handwriting

 (Leiden: Universiteitsbibliotheek, no. Or. 110), we do not know whether and how he

 derived his values for the inclinations of the inferior planets and ω a of the superior

 planets (see below) from his own observations. According to the list of its contents,

 book IX is devoted to the planetary retrograde motions and latitudes and book X to

 the stereographic projection of the celestial sphere onto a plane surface tangent to the

 north celestial pole, which is used for the drawing of astrolabe plates.23

 The maximum latitude of an inferior planet is due to the inclination of its epicycle

 and takes place when the planet is at inferior conjunction with the mean sun, i.e. at the

 true epicyclic anomaly of 180°. We indicate the inclination component of the latitude

 as /?ici (a) where a is the true epicyclic anomaly; /3max = $ci(180°) in Table 1.

 In the Ilkhânï Zij, the maximum tabular value for the latitude of Venus is 8;40°,24

 corresponding to i\ max % 3;25°. This is close to the extremal value 8;52° as derived

 from the Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses in which i \ max = 3; 30°.25 Never

 theless, the table itself suffers from some difficulties as explained in the "Appendix",

 so that it is actually impossible to assign one single value to i'imax from which the

 table has been computed. It is noteworthy that Ibn YSnus in his Hâkimï Zij has an extra

 table for the latitude of Venus where ftci(0°) = 1;29° and $ci(180°) = 8;52°.26 With

 it can be found that both latitude values result from the rounded i imax = 3; 30°. It

 seems that Ibn Yunus obtained this table either directly or via a medium from the

 Handy Tables. Note that a mixed tradition of the Almagest-Handy Tables for the lati

 tudes of the inferior planets already existed in earlier Islamic works (see note 3 above).

 The values 3; 25° or 3; 30° are in better agreement with the correct inclination of the

 planet than 2; 30° in the Almagest and other Islamic zijes.

 In al-Maghribï's Adwâr al-anwâr,29 the maximum latitude of Venus is 6;40°, which

 corresponds to i imax « 2; 37°. In his first zij, the Tàj al-azyâj, written at Damascus
 in 1258 before his joining Maragha, he has the value 8; 30° for the maximum lati

 tude of Venus,30 which corresponds to i'imax « 3; 21°. His value for the maximum

 latitude of Mercury in the Adwâr is 4;35°, corresponding to iimax » 7;2°.31 This

 is approximately equal to the Ptolemaic maximum value for the slant of Mercury,

 i.e., i2max = 7;0°. Since al-Maghribï's table of the slant is identical to the table in

 Almagest XIII.5,32 it is straightforwardly deduced that al-Maghribi took the maximum

 inclination of Mercury equal to its maximum slant, as in the Handy Tables!Planetary

 Hypotheses, although in the Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses Ptolemy takes
 in the inclination as 6; 30°, not 7;0°. It should be noted that the values near 7; 0° are in

 excellent agreement with the true value of the inclination of the planet.33 These values
 are summarized in Table 1.

 It appears to have been generally accepted after the Maragha observatory that the

 value 3; 30° for the inclination of Venus was a recent improvement upon the para

 meters of the Almagest. For instance, Ibn al-Shàtir refers to it as "what the moderns

 have amended [in the Almagest]"?A Also, one may conclude that in each of the two

 independent observational programs carried out at the Maragha observatory, i.e., by

 al-Maghribi and by the main staff of the observatory, who were engaged in preparing

 the llkhani Zij, it was found that the maximum values of the inclination and slant of one

 of the inferior planets are equal, although neither maintained this for the other inferior

 planet. This can be considered a partial rediscovery of Ptolemy's latitude model in the

 Handy Tables and Planetary Hypotheses. Over a century after the Maragha observa

 tory, al-Kâshî appears to have achieved the same result that in the new observations

 made by recent predecessors and modern scholars both the inclination and the slant

 of Venus and Mercury are, respectively, equal to 3;30° and 7;0°.35 He was familiar

 with both the zijes of the Maragha tradition, so that he was involved in the task of

 Islamic, Hebrew, and Spanish astronomical tables; e.g., the Muqtabis zîj of Ibn al-Kammàd (Chabâs and
 Goldstein 1994, p. 32), the Alfonsine Tables of Toledo, and the canons to the tables of Judah ben Asher

 II of Burgos (d. 1391) (Chabâs and Goldstein 2003, pp. 164-165). No relation between them and the Taj
 al-azyâj or ïlkhânî zîj seems to exist.

 31 A close value 4;38° is found in the Alfonsine Tables of Toledo and in the canons to the tables of Judah

 ben Asher II (Chabâs and Goldstein 2003, p. 164). No relation between it and al-Maghribi seems to exist,
 however.

 The tables of the latitude of Venus in Ibn al-Shàtir's Jadid Zij,38 Ulugh Beg's

 the llkhânï Zij, as are the tables of the latitude of Mercury aside from the correction for

 distance in computing the slant.41 This illustrates the influence that the formal work

 of the Maragha astronomy exerted on later Middle Eastern astronomers and that the

 inclinations of the inferior planets from the Maragha observatory appeared trustworthy

 to them. Perhaps for this reason, the astronomers at the Samarqand observatory turned

 to measuring the inclinations of the superior planets. The values derived for the incli

 nations of the superior planets from the critical entries in the northern and southern

 latitude tables in Ulugh Beg's Sultânï Zij42 are as listed in Table 2. The critical entries

 are the latitudes for the true anomaly of 90° and of 180°; the first is used to determine

 the inclination ι'ο of the eccentric and the latter to derive the maximum inclination

 i\ max of the epicycle. The subscripts 'N' and 'S' denote, respectively, the northern
 and southern latitudes. Note that our derivation of the inclinations from the extremal

 latitudes as explained in "Appendix" are based on the new values observed for the

 eccentricities and the radii of the epicycles of the superior planets at the Samarqand

 of this zîj (II.3: C: p. 42, P: fol. 15r, T: fol. 21v, M: fol. 27r) to add the values 7° and 12°, respectively, to
 the adjusted eccentric anomaly of Saturn and Jupiter prior to entering the tables. These are only due to the

 asymmetrical tables of the equations of the epicyclic anomaly of the two planets in this zîj, the entries of
 which are displaced and always additive by adding, respectively, 7° and 12° to those in the corresponding
 Almagest table, and thus these amounts should have been subtracted from the mean eccentric anomalies
 before tabulating. Consequently, after adjusting the mean eccentric anomaly by the equation of centre, the
 result is still smaller than the true eccentric anomaly by 7° and 12°, respectively.) These are in agreement
 with the values 150°, 82°, and 94° which 'Alîb. Muhamamd Qiïshiî (ca. 1402-74), one of the Samarqand
 astronomers contributing to the preparation of the Sultânî zîj (his name is explicitly mentioned in the
 prologue of the Sultânî zîj (PI: fol. lv, P2: lr)), gives in his Commentary on Zîj of Ulugh Beg (pp. 332-333)
 for the differences in longitude between the apogees and the ascending nodes of these planets in the Sultânî

 the values of i'o for Saturn and Jupiter are Ptolemy's while the corresponding latitudes
 are non-Ptolemaic.

 In Ptolemaic astronomy, the apsidal and nodal lines of the planets are sidereally fixed.
 Indian models have completely different features: the apsidal lines of the planets move

 in the direction of increasing longitude, but their nodal lines in the retrograde direction,

 like that of the moon, at unequal rates.43 The majority of (especially, early) Islamic zljes

 have Ptolemy's values for ω a·44 The non-Ptolemaic values for ω a from the Maragha

 1323); Ibn Yunus, Ο: fols. 78r-79r; al-Kàshï, ΙΟ: fol. 101ν (cf. Kennedy 1951, p.
 19). The Ptolemaic values were also prevalent in the Latin sources insofar as the

 524

 S. M. Mozaffari

 and Samarqand traditions are listed in Table 3 (the true modern values at the times are

 indicated in the columns headed Mod.). These values are either explicitly mentioned
 in the canons to the tables or can be extracted from the tables or columns for "the

 minutes of proportion". The minutes of proportion C5 is a simple cosine function of

 the argument of latitude ωρ = κ + ω a where κ is the true eccentric anomaly of the
 planet. In the Almagest, the user has to add the values of ω a to κ and then enter the table

 with the result. This is also the case with both al-Maghribi's and Wàbkanawï's zïjes,

 but in the Sultârii Zij the entries are shifted by -ω a with respect to the corresponding

 entries in the Almagest tables. As a result, the procedure is shortened by one step.

 3 Discussion and conclusion

 Unlike the detailed examples in the Almagest for determining the parameters of the

 planets' motions in longitude, Ptolemy did not mention specific observations for plan

 etary latitudes, only what appear to be approximate extreme values, which gave rise to

 some medieval objections. 45 Consequently, the medieval astronomers had no access

 to specialized methods and techniques required for making observations to determine

 the latitude parameters.46 The required observations for the derivation of the incli

 nations and the values of ω a should essentially be made at some specific conditions

 which are very rarely possible to satisfy: in order to measure the inclinations of the

 eccentric and the epicycle of a superior planet, it should be observed when it is both

 close to a limit and at opposition to (or as near as possible to conjunction with) the

 mean sun. This can take place once in about 30 years for Saturn, 12 years for Jupiter,

 and 15 or 17 years for Mars. The longitude of the ascending node can be determined

 when the planet crosses the ecliptic, in this case, when the centre of the epicycle is at

 a node, whose longitude is thus equal to the mean longitude of the planet.47 As men

 tioned briefly in Sect. 1, early Islamic astronomers employed Indian methods or the

 ungrounded (if not meaningless) mixed versions of the Hindu and Ptolemaic latitude

 theories, as well as having difficulties with understanding the latitude models in the

 Almagest. Among the surviving early Islamic zïjes, presumably al-Battânï's is one of

 the first works in which the Almagest latitude theory appeared in an understandable

 and correct abridged form (though, having a minor fault; see above, note 6), i.e., at

 the turn of the tenth century. These perhaps explain the reason it took a relatively long

 period until the first attempts were made to measure the inclinations of the planets (at

 the Maragha observatory in the mid-thirteenth century). Also, for the same reason, the

 Footnote 44 Continued

 materials reflected in the secondary literature indicate; e.g., Copernicus' De Revolutionibus (Swerdlow

 and Neugebauer 1984, p. 498), Bianchini (mid-fifteenth century; cf. Goldstein and Chabâs 2004, p. 460;

 Chabâs and Goldstein 2009, p. 95). The values of wa are not properly defined in the Alfonsine Tables of

 Toledo (Chabâs and Goldstein 2003, p. 163).

 45 E.g., Goldstein 2002, p. 27.

 46 We can address some alternative strategies developed in Islamic astronomy to facilitate obtaining specific

 parameters, to remove anticipated difficulties, or to secure desired results. But these alternative methods
 themselves are based upon already-existing ones, mostly proposed by Ptolemy himself (e.g., the two alter

 native methods for measuring the solar eccentricity, cf. Mozaffari 2013b, pp. 320-324).

 47 For the difficulties with the latitude observations, cf. Swerdlow 2005, pp. 47, 49.

 derivation of the latitude parameters from the observational data can be considered

 the acme of medieval observational astronomy.

 Concerning the Eastern branch of Islamic astronomy, a partial improvement upon

 Ptolemy's values for the inclinations of the inferior planets in the Almagest was

 made at the Maragha observatory. This can, however, be considered a rediscovery

 of Ptolemy's latitude models of the inferior planets both in the Handy Tables and

 Planetary Hypotheses, of which the Maragha astronomers were quite probably aware.

 Of course, al-Maghribi's value 7; 2° for the inclination of Mercury is in excellent

 agreement with the modern data, and thus clearly better than Ptolemy's values in the

 Almagest (6; 15°) and in the Handy Tables!Planetary Hypotheses (6; 30°). As the con

 tents of al-Maghribi's Talkhls al-majistl reveal, there is no doubt that he had made the

 actual observations at the Maragha observatory, as well as having the technical and

 mathematical skills to derive the parameters from the observational data. In the begin

 ning of 1262, the observations were begun in the Maragha observatory (al-Maghribi's

 first documented observation in the Talkhls is the lunar eclipse on 7 March 1262) and

 in April-May 1276, he completed the canons of his last zlj, Adwar al-anwar, and then

 engaged in preparing its tables.48

 Ulugh Beg's planetary parameters (Table 4; "Appendix", Tables 8,9) can explicitly

 indicate systematic observations at Samarqand, although nothing about them appears

 to have been documented. Unlike the improvement made at the Maragha observatory in

 the case of the inferior planets, the values the Samarqand observers determined for the

 inclinations of the superior planets are either equal to or larger than the corresponding

 values in the Almagest while they should be very close (if not essentially equal) to each

 other. Accordingly, it may be that the attempts made in the Samarqand observatory

 resulted in a deterioration in the Almagest's underlying values for the inclinations of

 the superior planets, while these had already been improved significantly in Ptolemy's

 other two works. We are not told how and when the Samarqand observers reached their

 own values for the extremal latitudes of the superior planets; in his Commentary on

 Zij of Ulugh Beg, Qûshôï only mentions the maximum and minimum latitudes at the

 limits, expressing "we found" them, but without giving any more information.49 The

 true values of the maximum latitudes of the three planets at oppositions, the zodiacal

 signs where they occurred in the period of 1430-49 when the Samarqand observatory

 was active, and their differences from the extremal values in the Sultânï Zij (Table 2)

 are given below. It is noteworthy that these errors are comparable with those found in

 the stellar latitudes in Ulugh Beg's star catalogue incorporated into his zij·50

 February 1273, 12 August 1274, and 26 February 1271, respectively, for the three planets. These are the
 dates when Ptolemy (Toomer 1998, pp. 484-498,507-519,525-537) and al-Maghribï (Talkhïs, fols. 123r
 123v, 128r—129r, 132v-133r) observed the last of their own trios of the oppositions of a superior planet to

 the mean sun required for determining its eccentricity and the direction of its apsidal line in the Almagest.

 The addition of one degree to Ptolemy's values is due to his well-known error in determining the moment

 of the vernal equinox by more than one day, making a displacement in the position he determined for the

 vernal equinox by a little over one degree. Consequently, it is required to take this error into account by

 adding one degree to Ptolemy's values in order to fix his longitudes in a correct tropical frame of reference.
 (3) The date considered for the Sultânïzlj is the epoch of this zij, 4 July 1437. The additional values are

 due to the fact that the longitudes of the apogees of Saturn and Jupiter have decreased by the values kj in

 the tables of the equations of anomaly and then tabulated (cf. "Appendix")

 About the values of ω\, it should be noted that observing no new value in the case of

 the inferior planets cannot be so strange because unlike the superior planets, the direc

 tions of the nodal lines of the eccentrics of the inferior planets in Ptolemaic astronomy

 are an intrinsic convention of the model that they are ±90° from the apsidal lines. It is

 not imaginable that an observer could recognize that the two are not perpendicular to

 each other when the centre of the epicycle is at either of the apsides, but make angles

 as small as about 1° and 16° to the perpendicular. In particular for Mercury, it should

 be considered that Ptolemy's longitude of the apogee of the planet, 191° in 135 AD, is
 over —30° from the true value of about 223°. The same error can also be found in the

 majority of the Islamic zijes with the exception of those based upon Indian parameters

 (e.g., al-Khwàrizmï's).51

 are as follows:

 The two interrelated problems in the values of ω\ for the superior planets in Table 3

 (a) These might initially be interpreted as indicating that the medieval astronomers

 were aware of the change in the relative directions of the apsidal and nodal lines.

 Then, an inevitable consequence of the continuous increase in o>a with respect to

 Ptolemy's values would be that the apsidal and nodal lines of the superior planets do
 not share the same motions, in contrast to the fundamental assumption in Ptolemaic

 astronomy that they are sidereally fixed. Nevertheless, such a conclusion was never

 posed in the Eastern (Middle Eastern) Islamic astronomy, where permitting any secular

 change in the Ptolemaic constants or fundamental assumptions and hypotheses was

 considered very unlikely. Accordingly, any new value, variation, or change found in a

 parameter was undoubtedly attributed to faulty observations, defects and discrepancies
 in instruments, and/or untrustworthy ancient data. However, a diametrically opposed

 point of view was adopted in the Western Islamic astronomy, where it was allowed
 to consider proper motions and/or models to account for the observationally found

 secular changes.52 For instance, about 1075, Ibn al-Zarqàlluh found that the solar

 apogee had the proper motion of 1° in 279 Julian years in the direction of increasing

 longitude, which is then added to the constant rate of precession l°/66y. Several
 Andalusian astronomers applied this proper motion to the apogees of the planets

 as well.53 Nevertheless, whether this proper motion was thought to be the case for

 the nodal lines of the planets, or whether other such proper motions were proposed

 for them, must await a thorough inspection of the materials related to the planetary

 latitudes in the Western Islamic zijes.

 (b) How were they obtained? These medieval values perhaps were the result of

 actual observations. Needless to say, the values of ω\ are dependent upon the val

 ues adopted for the longitudes of the apogees. By means of the two, one can also

 examine to what extent the values obtained for the longitudes of the nodes/limits were

 accurate.

 The longitudes of the apogees of the superior planets in the Maragha and Samarqand
 astronomical traditions are listed in Table 4.54 The values in brackets are the true values

 computed for the times. We round both the historical and modern values to the nearest

 0.5° which is sufficient for our purpose.

 As seen in Table 4, al-Maghribi has more precise values for the longitudes of

 the apogees of the superior planets than those applied to the Sultânï Zij. As regards

 Tables 3 and 4, one can deduce that the values obtained by al-Maghribi for the lon

 gitudes of the nodes/limits of the three planets are about +1°, +5°, —2.5° in error,

 respectively. Wàbkanawï's value for ω\ of Mars increases the error in the longitude

 of the nodes/limits of the planet to +15.5°. The corresponding errors in the Sultânï
 Zij are -1.5°, +3°, and +3.5°.

 As we shall see below, the possibility exists that al-Maghribi derived his values
 of oja from actual observations as accurate as the others documented in his treatise

 Talkhis al-majistl. Following him, Wâbkanawï mentioned in his zij some observations

 performed during his 40-year career, which were directed to reconciling theory and

 observation.55 Let us first consider whether and how the astronomers at Maragha and
 Samarqand were able to obtain their own values for &>a from observations in the

 periods of the activities in the two observatories.

 In the period of al-Maghribi's observations at Maragha (1262-76), he had one
 opportunity in the case of Jupiter and Saturn to find that Ptolemy's value of ω\ for

 each planet is invalid at the time and another to determine a correct value. In this period,

 the mean longitude of Saturn changed from about 21° to about 197°, the longitude of

 its perihelion was about 79°, and its ascending node was at the longitude of about 107°.
 From the three observations of Saturn made on 25 October 1263, 9 December 1266,

 and 27 February 1273 when the planet crossed the meridian of Maragha, by means

 parameters (cf. Mozaffari 2013b).

 54 Note that Wâbkanawï converted al-Maghribrs values to the epoch of his zlj, 13 March 1266, by adopting

 the processional rate of 1° in 66 Persian years (of 365 days unvarying).

 of Ptolemy's iterative algorithmic procedure, al-Maghribi obtained the longitude of

 the eccentric apogee of the planet as 258.5° (Table 4), which, of course, could be

 taken for the whole period of his observations at Maragha. Then, with Ptolemy's

 value o>a = +50°, the latitude of the planet should have been zero when its mean
 longitude was about Xq = - ω\ - 90° = 258.5° - 50° - 90° = 118.5°; this took
 place, according to modern theories, about mid-December 1269, and according to al

 Maghribi's Adwar, about mid-November 1269. About this time, the planet culminated

 at Maragha during nights and its latitude was about +0;43°,56 which is in the range of

 the accuracy of the instruments of the Maragha observatory.57 It is thus probable that if

 al-Maghribi had made systematic observations in this time interval, he could achieve

 the result that the planet had a sizable latitude while, adopting Ptolemy's ω a = +50°,

 its epicycle centre should have been located very near the ascending node, and thus
 its latitude should have been about zero.

 About mid-May to mid-December 1268, for some period before the last visibility

 of Saturn on 11 June and after its first visibility on 18 July, the longitude of the planet

 changed from about 99° to 113° and its latitude from about -0; 10° to +0; 10° and

 reached zero on 14 September. From observations of the planet near the horizon as

 accurate as those recorded in his Talkhis al-majisfi, al-Maghribi might then conclude

 that the latitude of the planet had reached zero somewhere in this period. His tables

 give about 100° to 107° for the mean longitude of Saturn in this time interval.58 This

 could lead to the result that ωχ for Saturn should be about 61.5°-68.5°. Therefore, it

 is probable that al-Maghribi's denial of Ptolemy's ω\ = +50° and his own rounded

 +60° were found by observation.

 In the similar situation for Jupiter, with the Ptolemaic ω\ = -20°, the planet should

 have crossed the ecliptic when its mean longitude was equal to = λΑ - û>a - 90° =

 178°+20°—90° = 108°. This took place according to both the modern ephemeris and

 al-Maghribï's Adwâr about 9-21 April 1267 while the latitude of the planet was about

 +0;26°. Unlike Saturn, the culmination of Jupiter in this interval occurred during

 daylight, but an observer had time enough to observe the planet after sunset and find

 that it had a slight latitude, while according to Ptolemy its latitude should be about

 zero.

 In the period of the activities at the Samarqand observatory ( 1430-49), the longitude

 of Saturn changed from about 211° to 174°, its ascending node was at about 109°, and

 its perihelion/perigee at about 82°. The Samarqand observers could thus observe the

 56 Al-Maghribï's Adwâr gives a value ~ + 0; 40°.

 57 As I have shown elsewhere, al-Maghribï's mean errors in the measurements of meridian altitudes by

 the central quadrant of the Maragha observatory are (regardless of sign) about 0;3° for the sun, 0;6° for

 the eight bright stars, and 0;5° for the planets. The mean errors in the latitudes of the stars and planets he

 computed from the observed meridian altitudes by the trigonometrical rules of spherical astronomy are,

 respectively, about 0;6° and 0; 10°. In particular for Saturn, in the three above-mentioned observations, the

 errors in the meridian altitude of the planet are, respectively, —0;9°, — 0;7°, and +0;6°, which resulted the
 errors of -0;15°, -0;8°, and +0;4° in the latitude of the planet as calculated by al-Maghribî. The mean

 error in the latitudes of the 16 stars recorded in the non-Ptolemaic star table of the îlkhanïZïj is about 0; 15°

 (they were probably made with the aid of the armillary sphere of the observatory).

 58 Al-Maghribï's Adwâr gives the planet's longitude as ~99° to ~ 113° and its latitude as -0; 13° to +0; 6°.

 planet when crossing its nodes, southern limit, and perigee, and this 20-year period

 was sufficient for Jupiter and Mars to be observed at all the critical points.

 To sum up, this paper has established that new values for the latitude parame
 ters, inclinations, and directions of the lines of the limits/nodes were observed at the

 Maragha and Samarqand observatories in late medieval Islamic astronomy, and has

 analysed their accuracy. However, in the absence of further documented information,

 it has not settled the question of how these values were determined, although some

 ways for deriving them from observations were proposed.

 Acknowledgments I would like to thank Prof. Benno Van Dalen (Germany) for his valuable helps; espe

 cially, I owe my information of the planetary latitudes in Ibn Yunus' Hakimi Zij to him, who kindly supplied

 me with his informative transcription and translation of the related chapter in that zij. Of course, only I

 should be held responsible for any error. This work was financially supported by the Research Institute for
 Astronomy and Astrophysics of Maragha (RIAAM).

 Appendix: Planetary inclinations and latitude tables

 In order to derive the inclinations from the planetary extremal latitudes and parameter
 values adopted in the zijes of the Maragha and Samarqand traditions, we make use

 of both modern and Ptolemy's methods. The first consists in solving trigonometrical

 equations resulted from the configuration of the ecliptic, eccentric, and epicycle at the

 northern or southern limit (in the case of the superior planets) and at the nodes (for

 the inferior planets). The latter is to extract the inclinations from the maximum and

 minimum latitudes by interpolation in the epicyclic equation tables, an approximate
 method explained in Almagest XIII.3.59

 Maragha: inferior planets

 Figure 3 shows the configuration of the eccentric and epicycle of Venus when the
 centre of the epicycle is at either of the nodes of the eccentric, i.e., ±90° from the

 apsidal line; in this position, the inclination of the epicycle is in the line of sight. The

 radius of the eccentric OC = R — 60, the eccentricity TO = e, the distance from the

 earth to the centre of the epicycle TC = (R2 - e2)l/2, and the radius of the epicycle
 CP = r. We let the true epicyclic anomaly a = LACP, so that PP' = QQ' = r sin a,
 PQ — P'Q' — r cos a sin ί'ι max, and CQ' = r cos a cos i'imax. For Mercury, the
 direction of the inclination of the epicycle is reversed, as the epicyclic apogee A is

 inclined to the north; also, TO = 2e. The latitude β = LPTQ is found from the below

 formula (negative sign for Venus and positive sign for Mercury):

 Fig. 3 Configuration of the epicycle and the eccentric of Venus when the centre of the epicycle is at the
 ascending node of the eccentric, ±90° from the apsidal line

 If a — 180°, for which the latitude of the inferior planets reaches its maximum value,

 all that is necessary is to solve triangle TBC in which LBTC — /Smax:

 TC CB TC _ r

 sin(LTBC) sin(ZC7i5) °Γ sin(jSmax + i\max) sin(^max)

 and so, i\max = (/3max + i\ max) - Anax· Therefore, i\ max can be conveniently found
 from TC,r, and /Smax·

 The underlying planetary parameters in the zijes of the Maragha tradition are as

 follows: the eccentricity of Venus in the llkhani Zij is e « 1 ;2 where R = 60,
 computed from the maximum tabular value gmax = 1;59° for the equation of centre
 of the planet,60 in al-Maghribi's Adwâr al-anwâr e & 1;3, from c/max = 2;0°.61 The
 value adopted for the eccentricity of Mercury, e = 3; 0, and the radii of the epicycles

 of both the inferior planets in these two zijes are Ptolemaic, Venus: 43; 10, Mercury:
 22;30.

 Due to Ptolemy's complicated model for Mercury's motion in longitude of a mov
 able eccentric, in Fig. 3: TC φ (R2 — e2)1/2, but with Ptolemy's value e — 3;0, TC ^
 56;40.62 Then, with al-Maghribi's value /3max = /3ici(180°) = 4;35° for the maximum
 latitude of Mercury, one can compute i\max ^ 7; 2° from (2).

 Our historical method, i.e., Ptolemy's solution, of which al-Maghribi quite probably

 made use, is an analogy between the extremal latitudes and inclination and the epicyclic
 equations and true epicyclic anomalies, respectively, in the sense that the extremal
 latitudes Aci(0) (= LATC in Fig. 3; line AT not drawn) and Acid 80°) (= LBTC) can

 be taken as the epicyclic equations in the correction tables for longitude corresponding,

 respectively, to the true epicyclic anomalies corresponding to the anomalies ±z'imax

 and 180° ± i\ max (in Fig. 3, assume that the epicycle is perpendicular to the ecliptic).
 When the centre of the epicycle of an inferior planet is at either of the nodes, i.e.,
 ±90° from the apsidal line, its true eccentric anomaly, LOTC in Fig. 3, is κ = ±90°,
 which corresponds to the mean eccentric anomaly ic ±93°. At this position, from
 al-Maghribi's table of the equations of Mercury, the following values for the epicyclic
 equation ρ can be derived:63

 5; 12° for α = 180° - ή max = 172° and

 4;34° fora = 180° -i'iraax = 173°.

 Al-Maghribi's /?max = 4; 35° falls between these two values. So, with taking it as the
 epicyclic equation, the linear interpolation between ρ — 5; 12° and ρ = 4;34° results
 in α = 180° — i\max % 172;58°, and thus i\max % 7;2°, which is in best agreement
 with our earlier derivation.

 Table 5 shows that a table computed from this value is in good agreement with

 al-Maghribi's tabular entries.64

 In the case of Venus, using formula (2) with al-Maghribi's value /3max =
 Aci(180°) = 6;40° results in i\ max = 2;37° (note that because the eccentricity of
 Venus is small, TC ~ 60). But this value cannot be derived from al-Maghribi's table

 The components of the epicyclic equation in the Almagest (about them, see Neugebauer 1975, Vol.1,

 pp. 183-186) with the tabular values in al-Maghribî's Adwâr are given below.

 of the epicyclic equation of Venus according to Ptolemy's procedure. As mentioned
 earlier, both in the llkhani Tij and in al-Maghribi's Adwâr, the radius of the epicycle

 of Venus is Ptolemaic, and as shown in Table 6, the tables of the epicyclic equation of

 the planet at mean distance in both z'ljes are equivalent to the corresponding one in the
 Almagest. Nevertheless, al-Maghribi has different values for the epicyclic equation
 for arguments 171°-179° (enclosed by the dashed lines in Table 6). I cannot explain
 why these entries are different, larger than the Almagest entries. As mentioned earlier,

 Ibn Yunus has a greater value for the radius of the epicycle of Venus than Ptolemy
 (r s» 43;28; see Table 6).65 But, al-Maghribi's equations for arguments 171°-179°
 can in no way be related to Ibn Yunus's.

 With Ptolemy's procedure, the maximum latitude βηνΛΧ = /S,ci( 180°) = 6;40°
 taken as the epicyclic equation at mean distance corresponds to an epicyclic anomaly
 a = 180° — ίι max = 177;28,38°, and thus iimax = 2;31,22° which is nearly equal
 to the Ptolemaic 2; 30°. It can be assumed that 6; 40° is estimated from the observed

 latitudes of Venus near inferior conjunction with the sun, although estimating latitude

 in this location is extremely difficult and al-Maghribi's error, like Ptolemy's is close
 to —2°, but it cannot be determined which of the two values for π max al-Maghribi

 actually derived from it. However, since the tabular entries for the inclination of Venus

 in his Adwâr are in better agreement with computation from ii max = 2; 37° than from

 h max = 2; 30° (see below), it seems to be safe to conclude that it is the first value that,

 in reality, underlies al-Maghribi's table in the Adwâr.

 In Table 7, Cols. 2 and 3, respectively, indicate the Almagest66 and al-Maghribi's

 table of the inclination of Venus in the Adwâr. Cols. 4 and 5 give the recomputed

 values from the two values for i\max. Neither of the two sets of the re-computed
 latitudes is as consistent with the tabular entries as we have seen earlier in the case of

 al-Maghribi's table of the inclination of Mercury (Table 5). The table was probably

 computed according to the following procedure: the entries for the arguments 0°-96°)

 are nearly identical to the corresponding entries in the Almagest, except for the slightly

 improved increments of 0; 1° for the first five entries; this seems reasonable, since a

 small change in i\max from 2;30° to 2;37° causes no critical change in the latitudes in

 this range (at most, 0; 3°). But most of the entries in the latter part of the table appear to

 have been derived from multiplying the corresponding entries in the Almagest table by

 6;40/6;22 (see Col. 6). It is noteworthy that applying similar procedures to computing

 the planetary equation tables can be found in Islamic astronomy, more remarkably, in

 al-Maghribi's Tâj al-azyâj61 as well as in the Ilkhânl Zij.6i

 In the Tâj al-azyâj, al-Maghribi has for Venus /?max = $ci(180°) = 8;30°. The
 table of the planet's epicyclic equation in this zij does not have those strange entries

 found in the Adwâr, but is identical to the Almagest/Handy Tables, and so to the

 Ilkhânl Zij (Table 6). Both formula (2) and interpolation in the anomalistic equation

 table of Venus result in /imax ^ 3;21°. Al-Maghribi's values for the inclination and

 the recomputed values are shown in Table 7 (Cols. 7 and 8).

 The entries in the latitude tables of the inferior planets in the Ilkhânl Zij are given

 for each integer degree of the argument. Col. 9 in Table 7 shows the entries in the

 table of the inclination of Venus in the Ilkhânï Zij. Both solving the trigonometrical
 equation (2) with /Smax = $ci(180o) = 8; 40° and interpolation in the table of the

 epicyclic equation of Venus results in iimax « 3;25°. But the first half of the table,

 in the region of the arguments 0°-90°, is identical to the corresponding table in the

 Almagest computed from i ι max = 2; 30°. Moreover, re-computation of the table from

 il max = 3; 25° (Col. 10) shows that the results are by no means in agreement with the

 entries in the latter part of the table. In MS. Ρ (fol. 44r) of the Ilkhânl Zij, an unknown
 commentator has restored the latter half of the table to the Ptolemaic numbers and thus

 reduced the maximum latitude of the planet to 6; 22°. We are told that this modification

 was done on the basis of the corresponding table in al-Maghribi's Zij, while, as we have

 66 Almagest ΧΙΠ.5: Toomer 1998, p. 633.

 67 See Dorce 2002-3, pp. 202-204; 2003, pp. 127-137.

 68 E.g., the table of the epicyclic equation of Mars in the ïlkhâni zîj (C: p. 116, P: fols. 38v-39r, M: fols.

 70v-71 ν) has the maximum value 42; 12°, corresponding to r «s 40; 18. Al-K3sM (IO: fol. 99r, 112r) notices

 that this value is different from Ptolemy and that the entries of the table are derived from multiplying the

 entries of the Almagest table (with the maximum value 41 ; 9° ; cf. Toomer 1998, p. 551 ) by 42; 12/41 ;9. Spot
 checks show that this is indeed the case.

 seen above, his Taj and Adwar have, respectively, the values 8;30° and 6;40° for the

 maximum latitude of Venus. It is worth noting that in his commentary on the Ilkhânï

 Zij, al-Nïshâbûrï briefly refers to this problem in the table of the latitude of Venus as a

 subtle point, but he offers no solution.69 Since the table is intrinsically contradictory, I

 cannot speculate about the reasoning behind it. However, it was apparently reasonable

 enough for Ibn al-Shâtir and the Samarqand astronomers to quote it in their own zijes.

 Samarqand: superior planets

 The new planetary parameters obtained at the Samarqand observatory, as deduced from

 Ulugh Beg's Sultarii zij, are summarized in Tables 8 for the equation of centre and 5

 for the equation of anomaly. In both, Cols. 2 and 4 show, respectively, the maximum

 and minimum equations tabulated in this zij and Cols. 3 and 5 show the arguments,

 mean eccentric or true epicyclic anomalies, for which the extremal values are given.

 The tables of the equation of centre in the Almagest are symmetrical and additive for

 half the table and subtractive for the other half, but in the Sultarii Zij, they are displaced
 and always additive; the values k\ = l/2(Max + Min) of the displacements and

 tfmax = l/2(Max - Min) of the maximum equations of centre (note that k\ > qmix),
 and the corresponding eccentricities e = R ■ tan l/2qmsa, where the radius of the
 eccentric R = 60, are given in the last three columns of Table 8.

 The tables of the equation of the epicyclic anomaly are also always additive, but

 they use a different type of the displacement explained as follows: for all the planets,

 the first half of the table, for arguments 0°-l 80°, corresponds to the equation p\ of the

 epicyclic anomaly at greatest distance (R + e; for Mercury: R + 3e), when the centre

 of the epicycle is located at the apogee, but the latter half of the table, for arguments

 180°-360°, to the equation pu of the epicyclic anomaly at the least distance (R - e,

 excepting Mercury), when the centre of the epicycle is located at the perigee. In the

 case of Saturn and Jupiter, all the entries are increased by an amount ki- For Mars

 and the two inferior planets, the first half of the table gives ρ a while the entries in the

 latter part of the table were increased by 360°, i.e., 360° — pn·10 The values ki are

 69 Al-Nïshâbûff, PI: fol. 119r, P2: fol. 143v.

 70 It is noteworthy that the method used in the Sultânï zîj for the displacement of the entries in the tables

 of the equation of centre of all the planets and the displacement method for the tables of the equation of

 anomaly of Saturn and Jupiter are those invented by Kushyàr b. Labbân in the latter part of the tenth century
 (see Brummelen 1998); they are also employed in the Îlkhànîzîj (see above, note 45). The method of 360°

 displacements appeared as early as the tables of the equation of centre of all the planets in Ibn al-Fahhâd's

 shown in Col. 6. Cols. 7 and 8 display the maximum values of the epicyclic equation,

 respectively, at apogee and perigee (for Saturn and Jupiter: pa,max = Max - k.2 and

 Pn.max = &2 — Min). The last column gives the corresponding epicyclic radii (for all

 the planets, except Mercury, r = sin ( ρ a, max) ·(/?+«) = sin(pn,max) · (/? — «)). In the

 Sultânï zlj, there is a table for the differences pu - Pa and two interpolation tables for

 each planet, one for the epicyclic anomaly 0°-l 80° and another for the epicyclic anom

 aly 180°-360°. The entries of the equation tables are carried to two sexagesimal places,

 except Mercury to one place, and are given for each integer degree of the argument

 (for Mars, from 150° to 210°, the arguments are in steps of 0;20°). Their reconstruc

 tion on the basis of the values derived above is in good agreement with the tabular
 entries.

 It merits noting that in his Commentary on Zij of Ulugh Beg, Qûshiï explains the

 layout of the equation and mean motion tables in this zij■ The values he mentions

 for the maximum equations agree with what can be extracted from the tables, with

 the exception of very slight differences in gmax of Saturn (6; 37,46°) and Jupiter

 (5; 18,42°). The parameters we deduced from the tables are in agreement with those he

 gives. As Qûshcï remarks, for all the planets, the mean eccentric anomalies are reduced

 and, inversely, the mean epicyclic anomalies are increased by the above-mentioned

 values for k\ and are then tabulated; and for Saturn and Jupiter, the longitudes of the

 apogees are decreased by the above-mentioned values for ^.71

 Figure 4 shows the configuration of the epicycle and eccentric, inclined to the

 ecliptic, of a superior planet when the centre of the epicycle is at the northern limit.

 In order to derive the inclinations from the extremal latitudes in the Sultânï zij, we

 should first know the distance TC = p' between the earth Τ and the centre C of the

 epicycle of a superior planet at the northern limit, which can be computed from the
 eccentricity (Table 8) and the value adopted for wa as mentioned earlier in Table 3.
 Where R = 60:

 Planet ρ ' northern ρ ' southern
 Saturn 61;57,29 58;29,44
 Jupiter 62;45,23 57;15, 4
 Mars 66;13, 8 53;47,26

 In Fig. 4, the distance TC = p' and the radius of the epicycle CP = r.
 We again let the true epicyclic anomaly a = LACP, and LCTN* = i'o, so that
 PP' : QQ' = r sin a, PQ = P'Q' = r cos a sin iimax,andCÔ' — r cos α cos iimax,
 and now QN = Q'N' = {TC + CQ') sin i'o· The latitude β = LPT Ν at either limit

 can be computed from:

 'Alâ'îzîj (ca. 1172) (cf. KamàB, fois. 48v-49r). A simple version of the 360° displacements in the tables

 of the equation of anomaly is adopted (to the best of my knowledge, for the first time) in the Îlkhànï zîj, of
 which, it can be said, the method employed in the Sultànïzîj is a more developed version. For a brief survey

 of the methods of the displacements, see Dalen 2004b, pp. 841-843.

 First, in order to derive io, we let a — 90° in (3); thus, we have:

 sini'o = y 1 + · sin (|Aci(90°)|) (4)

 Then, in order to derive ί'ι, we can solve a long trigonometric equation resulting from
 (3) for a = 180°, after substituting io computed from (4), a given value for the north
 ern or southern latitude for this epicyclic anomaly (/3max = LBTN'), and r and p' in

 (3). Instead, similar to what we have done earlier in the case of the inferior planets, a
 simpler solution is to solve triangle TCB in which LBTC = /Smax — io'·

 Our formulae (4) and (5), applying the planetary parameters and the tabular latitudes

 in Ulugh Beg's zij (as mentioned in Tables 2, 8,9), result in the inclinations in Table 2.

 The tables in the Sultânï Zij were generally calculated carefully, showing only minor

 deviations in the cases that have been examined,72 which is also true of the latitude

 tables at the northern and southern limits. Re-computation of the latitudes from the
 values derived for the inclinations is in good agreement with the tables in the Sultânï

 Zij with no difference exceeding 0; 1° in the case of Saturn, 0;3° for Jupiter, and 0;4°
 for Mars. Table 10 is a specimen for Mars at the southern limit, which shows the
 greatest differences.
