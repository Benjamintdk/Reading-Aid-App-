 Muhyï al-Dïn al-Maghribï's lunar measurements
 at the Maragha observatory

 Abstract This paper is a technical study of the systematic observations and com

 putations made by Muhyl al-DTn al-MaghribT (d. 1283) at the Maragha observatory

 (north-western Iran, c. 1259-1320) in order to newly determine the parameters of the

 Ptolemaic lunar model, as explained in his TalkhTs al-majistï, "Compendium of the

 AlmagestHe used three lunar eclipses on March 7,1262, April 7, 1270, and January

 24,1274, in order to measure the lunar epicycle radius and mean motions; an observa

 tion on April 20, 1264, to determine the lunar eccentricity; an observation on August

 29, 1264, to test the model; and another on March 15, 1262, for measuring the lunar

 parallax. In the second period of activity at the Maragha observatory, Shams al-DTn
 Muhammad al-Wâbkanawï (c. 1254-1320) adopted all of al-Maghribl's parameter

 values in his Zlj, but decreased his value for the mean longitude of the moon at epoch

 by 0; 13,11 °. By comparing the times of the new moons and lunar eclipses in the period

 of 1270-1320 as computed from the astronomical tables of the Maragha tradition with

 the true modern ones, it is argued that this correction was very probably the result of
 actual observations.

 1 Introduction

 The [Islamic] astronomers from the day of al-Ma'mun to al-Battânï and after

 wards did not mention their measurements in the same manner that Ptolemy

 mentioned his own computations, and did not manifest how they derived the

 planetary parameters from positions and motions of the planets through their

 continuous attempts to provide them. [...] He who elucidates his computational
 procedures is the most deserved to be followed.

 ~Abu al-Rayhàn al-BTrûnl (973-1048)'

 The Marâgha observatory was built in 1259 by Hiilegu (d. 1265), the founder of the

 îlkhânld dynasty of Iran. During its about fifty-eight years of operation, it represented

 the acme of Islamic astronomy.2 It appears that some observations at Maragha had

 taken place before the construction of the observatory: In his treatise on the astrolabe,

 Fï kayfiyyat tastïh al-basit al-kurî, Ibn al-Salâh al-Hamadhân! (d. 1153) said that, at

 Maragha, he had found a magnitude of 23;35° for the "total declination" (al-mayl al

 kulli; i.e., obliquity of the ecliptic).3 During the first two decades of the observatory,

 two zîjts were written: al-TusT's îlkhânt zïj in Persian and MuhyT al-Dîn al-Maghribï's

 Adwâr al-anwâr in Arabie. Al-TûsT (d. 1274) completed the IlkhànïZïj in about 1270.

 Although the majority of its underlying parameters are either Ptolemaic or borrowed

 from earlier zïjes, nevertheless, some parameter values adopted in the îlkhànï zïj were

 not known in any text prior to this work and appear to be the results of the observational

 program of the main staff of the observatory in the 1270s.4 MuhyT al-DTn (d. June

 1283) completed his zïj in the end of 1276 (see below). It was evidently based on

 the extensive observations done by him at the Maragha observatory. MuhyT al-Dîn
 later wrote a treatise named Talkhïs al-majistï, "Compendium of the Almagest," in

 which he describes his systematic observations and measurements of the solar, lunar,

 and planetary parameters. This treatise is our main concern in this paper. The two

 observational programs proceeded simultaneously and were conducted independently;

 none of MuhyT al-DTn's new values for some parameters, except his value 23;30° for

 wajadndhu bi- Ί-rasad bi-Mardgha 23 juza" wa 35 daqiqa. Nevertheless, in some later copies of it (e.g.,
 MS. Iran, Library of Parliament, no. 602, pp. 33-52, written originally by QâdT-zâdih al-Rûmî in Rajab

 892/July 1487, and MS. Iran, Library of Parliament, no. 6329, pp. 24-35), the second part (maqdla) of the

 treatise is the "Projection of the Astrolabe" ( Tastlh al-asturldb) of Muhyï al-Dîn al-Maghribï, wherein that

 author stated his own found magnitude for the total declination, 23;30° (bi-qadr al-mayl al-a'zam, huwa
 23;30 'aid md wajadndhu bi-'l-rasad; the edited text in the present author's thesis for receiving M. Sc.

 degree in the history of astronomy, cf. Mozaffari 2007).

 4 Cf. below, Sect. 5. Some parameter values applied to the ïlkhdnî Zîj that may not be found in earlier

 works are: (1) the values tabulated for the longitude of the solar apogee for the years 601 Yazdigird (AD

 1232) onwards; no relation between them and earlier zîjes may be found. Qutb al-DIn al-Shirâzï, a member

 of the observatory, associated these values with the "new observations" done at the Maragha observatory

 (al-Shïrâzî, Tuhfa, fol. 38v; al-Shïrâzî, Ikhtiyârdt, fol. 50v). (2) The radius of Mars' epicycle: the table for

 the epicyclic equation of Mars for the adjusted anomaly is symmetrical with the maximum value 42; 12°

 at mean distance (i.e., when the distance between the center of the planet's epicycle and that of the earth
 is equal to the radius of the deferent, which is taken as R = 60) (Îlkhânî Zîj. C: p. 116, P: fols. 38v-39r,

 M: fols. 70v-71v). This amount corresponds to the value 40; 18 for the radius of the epicycle. (3) A star

 table in which the ecliptical coordinates of 16 stars observed at the Maragha observatory are tabulated,

 accompanied by their coordinates according to Ptolemy and Ibn Yunus (d. 1007) as well as those attributed
 to Ibn al-A'lam (d. 985). All longitudes were converted to the epoch of the zîj, i.e., January 18, 1232.

 The coordinates attributed to Ibn al-A'lam appear to have been derived indirectly from the Mumtahan zfj
 (Baghdad, c. 830) (van Dalen 2004a, pp. 27-28).

 the obliquity of the ecliptic resulting from observations performed on three successive

 days after the two dates of June 12 and December 7, 1264, were employed in the
 Ilkhânï zîj

 Little is known about MuhyT al-DTn except that his full name is Abu al-Shukr/Abu al

 KarTm/Abu al-Fath Yahyâ b. Muhammad b. Abï al-Shukr b. Humid of the Maghrib (of

 Tunis, of Andalus, or of Cordoba). He spent some years (after 1237 to October 2,1260)

 in the service of King Nàsir of Damascus (reign: 1237-1260) in Aleppo, before the

 king was killed by the Mongols and al-Maghribl was sent to the Maragha observatory.

 Other than a short-period migration to Baghdad in the second part of the 1270s (see

 below), he seems to have lived at Maragha and done his observations at the Maragha

 observatory until his death in June 1283. He taught some students in the observatory5

 and wrote about 26 works on mathematics, astronomy, and astrology6 including two

 Zïjes: Tâj al-azyâj (Aleppo, about 1257)7 and Adwâr al-anwâr (Maragha, 1276).

 MuhyT al-DTn's systematic observations at the Maragha observatory made him

 such an outstanding figure that his contemporaries and immediate successors called

 him by unique honorific titles denoting his skill in doing observations. For instance,

 Ibn al-Fuwatï, the librarian of the observatory, called him the "geometrician of the

 observations," muhandis al-rasadî.8 His observational program is often named the

 "new Ïlkhànïd observations," rasad al-jadîd al-ïlkhânî, in order to distinguish it from

 the purported observations conducted at Maragha for preparing the îlkhânï zîj·9 His

 fame was so widespread that his astrological doctrines were generally trusted (nine of

 his treatises are on astrology). An amazing example of this is the interpretation of the

 appearance of the comet C/1402 D1 based on his astrological doctrines which led to

 a very decisive war in the Middle East at the turn of the fifteenth century.10

 This paper deals with al-Maghribl's lunar measurements as explained in the Talkhïs
 al-majistï. The work, its characteristics, and its place in the history of Islamic

 observational astronomy have already been introduced in three papers by George

 Saliba.11 Despite its name, the treatise is neither a rewriting nor an abridgement of the

 studied, cf. Voux (1891), Hogendijk (1993). S. Tekeli's short entry about al-Mghribï in DSB (Gillipsie et
 al. 1980, Vol. 9, p. 555) only covers his mathematical works. Also, cf. M. Comes' entry in Hockey et al.

 Sect. 5. In Mozaffari and Zotti (2013), all of the indications of the term, found in the treatises written either

 during the lifetime of the observatory or after that are introduced.

 11 The contents of the treatise were introduced in Saliba ( 1983). The computations related to the eccentricity

 of the sun and of Jupiter were subject to two critical studies by Saliba (1985; 1986; for al-Maghribï's solar

 observations, cf. Mozaffari 2013a, pp. 318,330). The present author analyzed al-Maghribï's measurements
 of the Ptoemaic orbital elements of Saturn in his Ph. D. dissertation. A detailed study of al-Maghribï's

 planetary and stellar observations is being prepared by him.

 contents of the Almagest, which, sometimes accompanied by criticisms about Ptolemy,

 was constituted as a genre with its own peculiar characteristics, playing a pivotal role

 in Islamic astronomy. Rather, in the same way of Ptolemy in the Almagest, MuhyT

 al-DTn expounds how he proceeded to establish systematically his parameters starting

 from measuring the latitude of Maragha, the length of the tropical year, the solar mean

 angular velocity, ... up to the planetary parameters. In order to present his measure

 ments, he first provides data obtained from his dated observations which are arranged

 chronologically, and then, he explains the mathematical procedure to determine the

 parameter in question. Finally, the procedures of applying the input observational data

 and doing computations are done, respectively, and described in detail. The obtained

 result is established as a new value or verified as an already existing one for that para

 meter. These materials as presented by MuhyT al-Dïn allow one to pursue precisely

 his line of investigation, to uncover his mistakes and their effects on the final result, to

 recognize the probable circular arguments, etc, which is indeed very useful for making

 a comprehensive critical study. Regarding its contents, the TalkhTs has no counterpart
 in the medieval astronomical literature of the Middle East. Some sections of the trea

 tise that are devoted to the measurement of planetary parameters may be considered

 as its most important parts, because it is hard to find any other work whose aim was

 to measure the planetary parameters in Islamic astronomy.

 The TalkhTs is preserved in a unique copy (Leiden, Universiteitsbibliotheek, no.

 Orientalis 110) in al-Maghribl's own handwriting. According to the table of contents

 given on fol. 2r, the treatise consists of ten books (maqâla). They discuss plane and

 spherical trigonometry (books I and II), time-reckoning (III), solar motion (IV), lunar

 motion (V), lunar parallax and the theory of eclipses (VI), longitudes and latitudes

 of the fixed stars (VII), planetary motions in longitude (VIII), retrograde motion and

 latitude of the planets (IX), and stereographic projection of the celestial sphere on the

 plane tangential to its north pole (X). The manuscript is, however, incomplete and

 corrupt where our author finishes his computations of Mars, while the reader expects

 he commences the computations related to the inferior planets. One may assume that it

 is the treatise itself that may have been left incomplete because of any possible reason.

 However, this does not appear to be the case here, because Wabkanawl reports three

 of MuhyT al-DTn's values for the parameters of the inferior planets.12 The last two

 books are also missing from this copy, but the contents of the last book may have been

 adopted from (possibly, a brief survey of) his treatise on the astrolabe, which deals

 with the same problem.13

 MuhyT al-DTn dedicated the TalkhTs to Sadr al-DTn Abu al-Hasan 'All b. Muhammad
 b. Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-TusT,14 the son of NasTr al-DTn al-TusT, who was

 appointed director of the observatory after the death of his father.15 According to

 the TalkhTs, MuhyT al-DTn's period of observations at the Maragha observatory was

 12 They are the eccentricities of Mercury and Venus: 3; 10 and 1:2,49, respectively, and the radius of the

 epicycle of Mercury: 22;30,30 (Wâbkanawï, IV, 15, 10: Τ: fols 93r-93v, Y: 160v— 161 r>.

 Cf. Mozaffari (2007). This treatise is interesting in various aspects; e.g., its clear mention of the infinite

 geometrical spaces.

 from March 7,1262 (lunar eclipse; c/. Table 1) to August 12,1274 (Jupiter). He applied

 the newly obtained parameters in his second zîj, the Adwâr al-anwâr, a copy of which

 has been preserved in the handwriting of the author (Mashhad, Holy Shrine Library,

 no. 332), which bears the date of Dhu al-qa'da 674 H (April/May 1276) in the end of

 the canons16 and the date of Rajab 675 H (December 1276/January 1277) in the end

 of the tables.17 These two dates may indicate when the canons and the tables were

 completed. It thus seems that he had finished his observations between August 12,

 1274 and April/May 1276, and had engaged in constructing the tables in the period

 between April and December 1276. He also mentions in the prologue of this copy of

 the Adwâr that he had commenced to write the zîj after completing a (now lost) treatise

 named Manâzil al-ajrâm al- 'ulwiyya, "The mansions of the upper bodies." We can

 therefore safely assume that the TalkhTs was written after MuhyT al-DTn completed

 the Adwâr, i.e., after the end of the year 1276. According to Ibn al-Fuwatl,18 MuhyT

 al-DTn left the observatory and spent a while in the service of Al-Sâhib Sharaf al-DTn

 b. al-Sâhib Shams al-DTn in Baghdad. The date of his departure was not given, but the

 migration had more likely been occurred after he finished the writing of the Adwâr,

 i.e., after the end of 1276. From Ibn al-Fuwatï's statements, it may be understood
 that this abandonment was due to some uncomfortable and inconvenient conditions

 at Maragha after the death of al-Tûsï, because he states immediately that after MuhyT

 al-DTn returned to Maragha, he was honored and supplied with the good amounts

 of regular stipend and honorarium. Thus, it is also possible that he has written the

 TalkhTs after his return from Baghdad to Maragha (i.e., a time after 1277 and, of

 course, before his death in 1283) when the observatory was directed by Sadr al-DTn

 and, likely, its dedication to Sadr al-DTn is as a response to his kind behavior toward
 the author.

 In this paper, Sect. 2 concerns al-MaghribT's observations of the three lunar eclipses

 at the Maragha observatory from which he determined the radius of the lunar epicycle
 and its mean motions. Section 3 introduces the other three lunar observations and

 explains al-MaghribT's procedures, calculations, and numerical details in six separate

 parts that are arranged as follows: the first two parts explain how our author determined

 the size of the epicycle and the mean motions; in the third part, the eccentricity of the

 lunar orbit in the Ptolemaic model; in the fourth part, the distance between the point

 of prosneusis and the center of the earth; and in the fifth part, the inclination of the

 lunar orbit. Then, al-MaghribT's tables of the lunar equations are briefly discussed.

 Finally, the last part deals with his determination of the lunar parallax. In all of these

 steps, the numerical values are al-MaghribT's. The recomputed or true modern values

 will be indicated explicitly (the former within square brackets). In Sect. 4, some

 highlighted characteristics of MuhyT al-DTn's observations, computations, methods,

 the instruments applied, and so on will be discussed and commented upon. His values

 for the lunar parameters will also be compared with the other medieval values obtained

 in the Middle East. Section 5 contains a comparative study between the times of the

 conjunctions and oppositions of the moon with the sun computed on the basis of

 modern theories and the times computed from the parameter values determined by

 al-Maghribl and those applied in the ïlkhânîztj■ This aims to evaluate the criticisms

 made by Wâbkanawï (an astronomer who flourished about two decades later in the

 observatory) of the Tlkhânïzïj and his modification of al-Maghribl's value for the lunar

 mean longitude, as will be explained there.

 2 The observations of the lunar eclipses at the Maragha observatory

 Table 1 presents the lunar eclipses observed by MuhyT al-DTn at the Maragha obser

 vatory, arranged chronologically, which have been used to determine the lunar para
 meters.

 Col. 1 contains the numbers by which our author refers to each eclipse.

 Col. 2 presents the dates of the observations given in the text according to the

 Yazdigird era and their corresponding dates in the Julian calendar and in Julian Days

 Number. In order to transform the dates from the Yazdigird era to the Julian one,

 it should be considered that in Islamic chronology, the day is traditionally reck

 oned from sunset, and hence, "night" precedes "day." As a result, for example, the

 night of Wednesday, February 28, 631 Yazdigird, is the time interval between sunset

 on Tuesday, the 27th, and sunrise on the 28th. This confusion cannot occur when

 we use the equivalent Julian dates. Since our author has made the precise time of

 the maximum phase of each eclipse available (Coi. 3), the dates can be converted

 conveniently.

 Col. 3 presents the times of the eclipses, that is, the instants when the maxi

 mum phases occurred, counted from the beginning of the Yazdigird era. Our author

 (R= 185.28 cm) (Toomer 1998, p. 56). This dioptra has a fixed lower pinnula on which there is a hole for

 sighting, and a movable outer one, which is placed in front of the sun. The solar/lunar angular diameter is

 calculated based on the movable pinnula's width and the distance between the two pinnulas. In his Fîkayfîyya

 observatory (d. 1266), presented an addition for the antique dioptra to determine the eclipsed area/diameter

 of the sun or the moon (Seemann 1929, pp. 61-71). Thus, Muhyî al-Dîn had a specific instrument for
 measuring the magnitude of eclipses at his disposal, which he may have applied to these lunar eclipses.

 In the Risûlu al-Ghàzâniyya fi Ί-ûlât ul-rasadiyya ("Ghâzân's treatise on observational instruments") (cf.

 Zotti and Mozaffari 2010, pp. 165-167; Mozaffari and Zotti 2012, pp. 419—421 ) and in Wâbkanawî's Zïj

 (IV, 15, 8: Y: fols. 159r—159v, T: fols. 92r-92v), an instrument as a pinhole image device is introduced that

 fulfills the measuring of the magnitude of solar eclipses. The treatise contains the physical descriptions and

 applications of 12 new observational instruments in the second period of the Maragha observatory, which

 were presumably the inventions of Ghâzân Khân, the seventh ruler of the ïlkhânld dynasty of Iran (reg. 21
 October 1295-17 May 1304). About it, also see Mozaffari and Zotti (2013).

 own parameters.22 As we shall see below, in order to measure the radius of the lunar

 epicycle, it is necessary as the first step to obtain the moon's longitudes at the instants

 of the maximum phases of a trio of the lunar eclipses, i.e., when the moon is in

 true opposition to the sun. Then, they can readily be calculated as = λ0+ 180°.

 In the following, MuhyT al-DTn's values for the lunar latitude and the longitude of

 its ascending node at the time of the eclipse no. 3 are compared with the corresponding

 modern data; cf. Sect. 3.2, (28) and (30).

 Col. 7 shows the observed altitudes of some bright stars which were ordinarily

 used in order to determine the durations and times of the phases of the lunar eclipses.

 The position with respect to the horizon of a given celestial body may be given by

 means of its altitude plus its direction with respect to the meridian line; e.g., "510 East"

 means an altitude of 51° at a given instant while it is located east of the meridian. An

 important note here is that in the case of the eclipse no. 1, the directions MuhyT al-Dln

 cites for the measured altitudes do not express the direction of the star with respect
 to the meridian, but with reference to the lunar disk. Otherwise, the altitudes should

 have been expressed as 510 East for Regulus and 17° East for Spica at, respectively,

 the start and end of totality.

 Based on what our author says (fol. 67v), these were the eclipses that he "dealt with

 observing them with the extreme accuracy," and thus, he could rely on his observations

 and be confident about the correctness of the data obtained from them. In the period of

 his observations, nine other lunar eclipses were observable at their maximum phases

 from Maragha, and MuhyT al-Dïn might have witnessed them as well.

 " For example, for the time of the maximum phase of the eclipse no. 1, the true longitude of the sun is
 calculated as follows:

 3 Muhyï al-Dïn's lunar measurements

 In Talkhîs V, chapter 1, MuhyT al-DTn reviews the situations of lunar motions in lon

 gitude, in anomaly, and in latitude, their periods, and explains the reason why ancient

 astronomers used lunar eclipses for measuring them (a recapitulation of Almagest IV,

 1-3). In chapter 2, he suggests the equivalence of eccentric and epicyclic hypotheses

 (Almagest IV, 5) and gives the magnitudes of the radius of the lunar epicycle computed

 by Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and himself. In chapter 3, Ptolemy's first (or Hipparchus')

 model of the moon consisting of an epicycle rotating on a zero-eccentricity inclined

 deferent which intersects the ecliptic in the two orbital nodes is introduced. Our author,

 of course, mentions that the lunar motions cannot be explained by the aid of only an

 epicyclic hypothesis, but it needs to take the eccentric hypothesis into account as well

 (introductory remark in Almagest IV, 6). In chapter 4, our author computes the radius

 of the moon's epicycle from the trio of lunar eclipses observed at the Maragha obser

 vatory (Table 1 and below, Sect. 3.1 ) (corresponding to Almagest IV, 6). In chapters 5

 and 6, by comparing his third lunar eclipse and that of October 20, 134 observed by

 Ptolemy at Alexandria, he determines the rates of the lunar mean motions in longitude

 and in anomaly and that of the retrograde motion of the nodal line of the lunar orbit

 (below, Sect. 3.2) (Almagest IV, 7 and 9). In chapter 7, he computes the mean positions

 of the moon and the longitude of its ascending node at the epoch, i.e., for the end of the

 year 600 Yazdigird (= mean noon of January 17, 1232, JDN 2171062, at Maragha),

 from those in his eclipse no. 3 (Almagest IV, 8 and 9) and then constructs the tables

 of the lunar mean motions (Almagest IV, 4). In chapter 8, the second anomaly of the

 moon, which is related to its elongation from the sun, and then Ptolemy's second lunar

 model based on an eccentric with the movable center to account for this anomaly are

 explained (Almagest V, 2 and 3). In chapter 9, our author computes the eccentricity
 of the now inclined eccentric deferent of the moon based on an observation done at

 Maragha in April 20, 1264 when the moon was near its last mean quadrature (below,
 Table 2 and Sect. 3.3) (Almagest V, 4). In chapter 10, he describes the idea of prosneu

 sis (inhirâf or muhâdhât), that is, the point on the apsidal line of the lunar eccentric,

 in which the diameter passing through the lunar mean epicyclic apogee and perigee is

 directed is displaced from the earth's center by the amount of eccentricity toward the

 lunar eccentric perigee. Our author measures the value of the displacement through an

 observation performed on August 29, 1264 when the moon was close to mean octant

 (below, Table 3 and Sect. 3.4) and verifies that it is equal to the eccentricity (Almagest

 V, 5). In chapter 11, our author instructs how to calculate trigonometrically the equa

 tions resulting from the lunar anomalies, constructs the tables for their components,

 and explains the procedure of computing the true ecliptical coordinates of the moon

 from the tables of the mean motions and equations (Almagest V, 6-9). The final parts

 of chapters 9 and 10 are specified to our author's computations of the inclination of

 the moon's eccentric from the last two observations (see below, Sect. 3.5). The book V

 ends with chapter 12 that explains the schemata of the four orbs of the moon (Ptolemy's

 Planetary Hypotheses II).

 Ptolemaic ready-to-use model in his mind24 and now wants, to a larger degree, to
 renew the computation of its underlying parameters and, to a lesser degree, to test it

 (especially, in the case of prosneusis). Figure 1 illustrates the Ptolemaic lunar model,

 3.1 The measurement of the radius r of the lunar epicycle

 In Almagest IV, 6, Ptolemy proposed a mathematical method to determine the radius
 r of the moon's epicycle in terms of the radius of its deferent R = 60 from the data
 obtained from the observations of three lunar eclipses.25 Mûhyï al-DTn's method in
 chapter 4 (fols. 69r-70v) is essentially that of Ptolemy; however, the application of
 the sine function makes the steps shorter and the whole procedure somewhat easier
 to-reconstruct.

 Assume that, in Fig. 2a, b, the points A, B, and C show the position of the moon

 on its epicycle in the eclipses nos. 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig. 2a, b are copies of the
 diagrams drawn by our author in the manuscript, fol. 70v).26

 We know the times of the three eclipses since the epoch {cf. Col. 3 of Table 1).

 Thus, the time intervals between two successive eclipses are

 From eclipse no. 1 -» no. 2 8 years 33 days I ;55 h
 From eclipse no. 2 -» no. 3 3 years 292 days 3;47 h

 In Fig. 3a, the positions of the mean and true moon (A, B, C) at the times of the

 three lunar eclipses are shown (drawn to scale). Figure 3b (which is the drawn-to-scale

 version of the same Fig. 2a, b) is produced through transforming DC and DB (the lines

 passing through the earth D and the moon in the eclipses nos. 2 and 3) in such a

 manner that each of them occupies their true position with respect to the mean moon

 Then, it can easily be seen that L ADB and L ADC can be calculated from Δλ - ΔΑ

 LADB = 30;57,18 - 30;30,11 = 0;27,7°,

 LBDC = 286:48,27 - 277;44,27 = 9;4,0°.

 (2)

 Now, the problem is to find the radius TH{— r) of the circle ABC (= the lunar
 epicycle), so that the chords AB, BC, and AC appear from D (the earth) under the
 angles ADB, BDC, and ADC, respectively.

 From (1), LAEB = 1/2(are AB) = 30;58,43°, then LDBE = 30;31,36°. If we
 assign to ED an arbitrary length equal to 60, then with applying the sine rule to the

 plane triangle BED (Fig. 2a), we can calculate the length of BE in terms of ED. Our

 author computed it as

 BE = 0;55,54,18 [0;55,54,17]. (3)

 (Hereafter, all numbers are Muhyi al-Din's; the recomputed numbers are given in
 brackets and the deviations are indicated in italics.) From (1), arc ABC = 185;9,25°.

 As a result, arc CA = 174;50,35°. Thus, LAEC = 1/2 (arc AC) = 87;25,17,30°. From
 (2), LADC = LBDC- LADB = 8;36,53°. Thus, LECD = 78;48,24,30°. Again, with

 applying the sine rule to the plane triangle CED, we have:

 CE = 9; 10,11,26 [9,9,41,53) (4)

 in terms of DE = 60.

 We also have LBEC = LAEB + LAEC = 118:24,0,30°. We extend the chord EC

 from Ε to the right side and drop the perpendicular BZ that intersects it at Z. Thus,
 LBEZ = 61;35,59,30°, which is indeed, our author says, acute, and L BZE is right.
 Then, LEBZ = 28;24,0,30°.

 Now, we want to calculate the length of BC. First, in the triangle BEZ, we calculate

 the lengths of the lines BZ and EZr7

 BZ = BE ■ Sin /.BEZ = 0:49,18,29 [0:49.10,35]
 EZ = BE Sin LEBZ = 0:26,35,23,27 [0:26,35.23,8].

 9;36,46,49 [9:36,17,16], Then

 Now, we want to compute the length of the chord AE. In the triangle BCZ:

 LBCZ = Sin"1 (BZ/BC) = 4;53,16° [4:52,39°].

 80

 S. M. Mozaffari

 Until now, all of the lines have been calculated in terms of DE = 60. We desire

 to express all of the lengths in terms of the radius of the lunar epicycle (circle ABC)

 taken as r = 60. For this purpose, our author computes:

 BC — Crd (arc BEC) = r ■ crd (arc BEC) = 2 · Sin(IBEZ)

 = 105;33,27,56,52 [105,33,27,41,7]. ^

 Here, the length of BC is in terms of r = 60. Equations (5) and (6) establish the

 ratio for expressing the lengths of the lines, which were already computed in terms of

 DE = 60, in terms of r = 60. We can then determine the length of DE in terms of
 r = 60 as

 DE = 60 χ (105;33,27,56,52/9;38,43,5)

 = 10,56;38,14,49 [10,5 7;1,5,46], (7)

 And, indeed, arc BE = 2 · {LBCZ) = 9:46,32° [9;45,7<S°]. From (1), arc AE =

 arc BE + arc AB = 71;43,58° [71:42,44°]. We can then calculate the length of the
 chord AE in terms of r = 60:

 AE = 2 · Sin (aicAE/2) = 70; 18,27,59 [70: 17,24,43,46]. (8)

 From (7) and (8), we can calculate the length of the line AD connecting the moon to

 the center of the earth at the instant of the maximum phase of the eclipse no. 1 :

 AD = AE + DE = 12,6;56,42,48 [12,7; 18,30,30]. (9)

 With regard to Fig. 2b, by Euclid III, 36,28 from (7) and (9):

 YD ■ DH = AD ■ DE = 2,12,35,39;27,22,41 [2,12,44,14;57,11,9]. (10)

 By Euclid II, 6,29 from (10) and TH = r = 60, we have:

 DT = (YD DH + TH2)l/2 = 11,33;29,52,45 [11,33^2,70,25]. (11)

 The line DT is the radius of the moon's deferent and is now known in terms of r = 60.

 If we assume R = DT — 60, then we can conveniently calculate the length of r in
 terms of R = 60 as

 r = (60 x 60)/11,33,29,52,45 = 5; 11,28 [5;1 !,/«]. (12)

 MuhyT al-Dïn rounds the final result as 5; 12. The errors befallen to our author are so

 small that their effect on the final result would not produce a rounded value other than

 5; 12. The maximum amount of the difference between the mean and true positions of
 the moon will then be Sin"'(5; 12) % 4;58°, under the condition that the center of the

 lunar deferent coincides with that of the earth or, in other words, the moon revolves on

 a zero-eccentricity deferent (al-falak al-muwâfiq al-markaz)· In his earlier zïj, Tâj al

 azyâj, our author has 4;51° (corresponding to r « 5;5),30 which is the value ascribed
 to Ibn al-A'lam (d. 985) (see below, Sect. 4.7).

 3.2 The measurements of ω(, ωα> and ωη

 In chapters 5 and 6 (fols. 70v-72r) the procedure of determining the mean angular

 motions of the moon is described: the mean motion in anomaly, ωα, the mean motion in

 longitude, o»t. and the velocity of the retrograde motion of the lunar orbital nodes, ωη·

 In doing so, the author made use of the data obtained for the instant of the maximum

 phase of the eclipse no.3.

 In Fig. 2b, we drop the perpendicular TKL from the center Τ of the epicycle to
 the line AE, so that it bisects the line AE at Κ and the arc AE at L. Indeed, from (8),

 KE = 35;9,13,59,30 [35-8,42,21,53]. Then, with the length of DE from (7):

 DK = DE+KE= 11,31 ;47,28,48,30 [ 11,32;9,48, 7,53]. (13)

 Applying the sine rule to the plane triangle KTD, with (II) and ( 13), we have:

 LDTK = Sin~\(DK/DT) ■ Sin(LTKD) = 85;58,40° [85;58,52°]. (14)

 Thus,

 LKDT — 90° — LDTK = 4; 1,20° [4;1,β°] (15)

 L KDT is the epicyclic equation of the moon at the instant of the maximum phase of
 the eclipse no. 1. From (2), LADC = LBDC — LADB = 8;36,53°. Thus, from (15):

 LYDC = LADC - LKDT = 4;35,33° [4;35,45°], (16)

 which is the epicyclic equation of the moon at the instant of the maximum phase of
 the eclipse no. 3. From (14): arc YL = 180° - LDTK = 94; 1,20° [94; 1,8°]; also, we

 previously computed arc A Ε = 71:43,58°. Thus,

 arc YA = arc YL — arcAE/2 = 58;9,21° [58;9,9°]. (17)

 The arc YA is the true lunar anomaly a {khâssa al-mu 'addala, lit. "adjusted anomaly,"
 named against mean anomaly <5, khâssa al-wustâ, which our author will introduce

 30 Dorce (2003, p. 203).

 later) at the instant of the maximum phase of the eclipse no. 1. In this way, the true

 anomaly of the moon at the maximum phases of the other two eclipses, i.e., the arcs

 YB and YC, respectively, will be determined as follows. From (1), we have:

 arc YB = arc Y A + arc AB = 120;6,47° [ 120;6,35° ),

 arc YC = arc YA + arc AB + arc BC = 243; 18,46°[243; 1

 ο (18)

 The true lunar anomaly in the eclipse no. 3, i.e., the arc YC, is indeed more than 180°.

 Consequently, the lunar epicyclic equation calculated in (16) should be subtracted

 from its true longitude in order to obtain its mean longitude (i.e., the longitude of

 the center of the lunar epicycle). From Col. 3 of Table 1, Xq = 311 ;41,28°, and so

 Aj = 131 ;41,28°. Then from (16):

 I,= 131;41,28-4;35,33 = 127;5,55°

 [131 ;41,28 — 4;35,45 = \21\5,43°]. (19)

 Now, we have the mean longitude of the moon in a well-measured time. In order to

 determine cot, a mean longitude λ jO for a given instant ίο should also be available. oj{

 can then be computed from ΔΑ/Δί. In doing so, MuhyT al-DTn used the data presented

 by Ptolemy in Almagest IV, 6 for the second of the triple lunar eclipses observed by

 him at Alexandria (geographical longitude L = 82° from the Fortunate Isles, i.e.,

 Canary Islands).31 The data are as below:

 Date Ο 3>

 20 October 134 AD Λ
 jDN 1770294 206;42° 64;38° 29;30° 25;10° 199;20,18°

 (20)

 Our author converts the time of the maximum phase of this eclipse (counted from the

 beginning of the Nabonassar era) from the local time of Alexandria to that of Maragha
 (L = 62°) by adding l;20h:

 t0 = 881 years 92 days 12; 20 hours.

 The date of our author's eclipse no. 3 corresponds to 18 Choiak 2022 Nabonassar.

 Thus, the time of the maximum phase of this eclipse counted from the beginning of
 the Nabonassar era is

 t — 2021 years 107 days 14; 0 hours.

 31 Toomer (1998, pp. 198 and 203), Pedersen (1974), Appendix A, no. 69 (on p. 418); hereafter, our
 author calls this as "First Eclipse" and his eclipse no. 3 as "Second Eclipse." For the analysis of the eclipses

 Therefore, the time difference between the two eclipses is

 At = 1140 years 15 days 1;40 hours = 1,55,35,15;4,10days. (21)

 Indeed, from (19) and (20), AÂ = 97:35,55° [97:35,43°]. Our author calculated that

 the moon completed 15230 revolutions +97;35,55° [97;35,43°] during the period
 (21); thus,

 ÛK = 13;10,35,1,52,46,45°/d [...,40,32] (22)

 (Tàj al-azyàj : ..., 36,32,17)32

 In order to determine o>a, we should also have two magnitudes â and âo for the mean

 anomaly of the moon measured, respectively, in the two times t and to sufficiently far

 from each other. From (20), it is clear that at the instant of the maximum phase of

 Ptolemy's eclipse no. 2, the moon's double mean elongation (Centrum) was 2ή =
 0:5,36°. By means of interpolation in the Almagest table for the lunar equation of

 center, our author obtains the equation of center <7(0;5,36) = 0:50°(0:49°).33 The

 lunar mean anomaly in the Ptolemaic model is calculated by

 â = a q(2n)

 (-if 0 < 2ή < 180°; + if 180° <2ή< 360°)

 (23)

 Then, the mean anomaly of the moon at the time of Ptolemy's eclipse no. 2 was

 â0 = 64;38 - 0:50 = 63;48° (24)

 MuhyT al-DTn gives I© = 310:20° and λ y = 127;5,55° [above (19)] for the instant
 of the maximum phase of his eclipse no. 3. Thus, 2ή % 353; 32°. Now, by means of

 interpolation in the table of the lunar equation of center (so-called the "first equation")

 calculated on the basis of his new value for the lunar eccentricity (cf. below, Sect. 3.3),

 the lunar equation of center is derived as q(353;32) = 0;51,44°.34 Thus, from (18)

 and (23), the mean anomaly of the moon at the instant of our author's eclipse no. 3 is

 ά = 243; 18,46 + 0;51,44 = 244; 10,30°.

 (25)

 32 Dorce (2003, p. 197).

 33 Note that our author computes here the mean anomaly of the moon according to the Ptolemaic lunar

 model introducing the second anomaly of the moon and the prosiieusix while he has not yet expounded

 this model and that the correction due to the prosneusis, i.e., the lunar equation of center, should be taken

 into account in order to compute the lunar mean anomaly from its true anomaly. In the situations like

 this, he refers reader to the future chapters. Another note is that Ptolemy in Almagest IV, 7 (Toomer 1998,

 p. 204; Neugebauer 1975, Vol. I, pp. 78-79) computes ωα according to his first (i.e., Hipparchan) lunar

 model, but never comes back to revise it after completing his lunar model. On the four-eclipse method for

 determining the length of the lunar anomalistic month (i.e., 360°/ωα) described by Ptolemy and a more

 coherent formulation of it by Jâbir b. Aflah (β. Spain, the 12th et.), cf. Bellver (2006).

 Thus, from (24) and (25), Δα = 180;22,30°. The moon completed 15101 revolutions

 around the center of its epicycle + 180;22,30° in the period (21 ). Therefore,

 ωΆ = 13;3,53,42,5 l,59,0°/d [...,58,26,20,17] (26)

 (Tàj al-azyà j : 56,9,27,7)

 In order to compute the rate of the retrograde motion of the lunar orbital node, ωΩ,

 our author first draws Fig. 4 (on folio 72r) which shows the position of the moon at

 the maximum phase of the eclipse no. 3 with respect to the ascending node (A), to the

 ecliptic (AB), and to the circle of the earth's shadow (the bigger circle with center B).
 Our author states that the angular apparent diameter of the moon at the time of this

 eclipse was = 0;33,43°,35 According to Almagest V, 14, the apparent radius of the
 earth's shadow in the moon's orbit is

 BD = r% = (13/5) · (0,/2) = 0;43,50°. (27)

 The magnitude of the eclipse no. 3 was 4/5 (cf. Col. 5 of Table 1). Thus, we have:

 CD = (1/2-1/5) = 0;10,7°
 BC = BD - CD = 0;33,43° .

 BC is the latitude β of the moon. The modern value for the geocentric latitude of the
 moon at that moment is β = +0;34,52°.36 In the triangle ABC, LB = 90°, and LA

 35 Our author discussion on the solar and lunar angular diameters as well as his non-Ptolemaic value for

 the minimum apparent diameter of the moon and sun, i.e., 0;31,8°, appear in VI, 6 (fol. 93v onwards).

 36 Note that although the input data for the calculation of fi is the magnitude of the eclipse, which was
 obtained from the observation, the value of ft in (28) should be compared with the modern value of the

 is the maximum latitude (= the inclination /' of the orbit) of the moon, which is equal

 to 5° (cf. Sect. 3.5). Thus,

 AC — 6;27,18° [6;27,40°}. (29)

 We know that the true longitude of the moon in the eclipse no. 3 was = 131;41,28°;

 thus, the true longitude of the ascending node Λ is37

 λα = λί-arc AC =\25-\4,\0° [125 -,13,48°] (30)

 in fair agreement with the modern value for xn at the instant of the maximum phase
 of the eclipse no. 3: λα = 125; 15,38°. In Ptolemy's eclipse no. 2 [above (20)]:
 ln = 199;20,18°; thus, ΔΑη = —74;6,8°[—74;6,30°], The ascending node there
 fore completed 61 revolutions +74:6,8°[+74:6,30°] in the direction of decreasing

 longitude in the time interval (21); then,

 (Tôj al-azyàj : ...,38,58,42,48)

 In order to determine the lunar mean positions at the epoch, in chapter 7 (fol. 72v),

 our author computes back to the end of the year 600 Y (mean noon of January 17,

 1232 at Maragha) from the eclipse no. 3 with the mean positions already calculated
 in (19), (25), and (30).

 (2): When the moon transited the meridian

 motions at the times other than conjunctions and oppositions. He also knew that the

 lunar epicyclic equation at mean quadrature (when the moon's mean elongation from

 the sun is 180 ± 90°) is greater than any similar epicyclic position occupied at the other

 phases and that the moon has the least distance to the earth at quadratures. In order to

 determine how much greater the epicyclic equation may be at mean quadratures, which

 also makes possible to measure the lunar eccentricity, the moon should be observed

 when both (a) it is near mean quadrature and (b) it has an anomaly of about 95° to

 cause its epicyclic equation to be maximum. Our author starts his computations in
 chapter 8 (fols. 73r-76r) from the values observed for the altitudes of the sun and

 moon when the moon transited the meridian of Maragha on Sunday, April 20, 1264.

 At that moment, the moon was near its last mean qudrature (Table 2).

 He gave the following quantities for the instant of this observation, by which he

 computed the moon's ecliptical coordinates as follows (also see below, Sect. 4.6):

 The sun's oblique ascension : Αφ(λΌ) = 24;31,12°[23;57,570]39

 Time elapsed since sunrise : ~ 10.5 min = 2;37,20° [2;37,45°]40

 A© = 37; 15,46° [modern : 37; 13,42°] (33)

 Our author draws Fig. 5 (fol. 76v) in which AB is an arc of the eastern horizon, CBL,

 the meridian and ADE, the eastern arc of the ecliptic, the southern pole of which is M.

 Thus, A is the ascendant (ία/Π and D is the mid-heaven or the transit degree (darajat

 al-tawassut) whose longitude is denoted by Amid. CTY is the eastern arc of the celestial

 equator; thus, the arc TY is the oblique ascension of the arc TA (i.e., ΑΨ(Τ A) = TY).
 At the moment of the observation, the apparent moon is at Z, but the true moon is at

 Η. ZH shows the lunar parallax in the vertical/altitude circle. Hence, ZB is the lunar

 apparent (topocentric) altitude and HB is its true (geocentric) altitude. We draw the

 orthogonal MHE to the ecliptic (LHED = 90°); thus, Ε is the true position of moon

 on the ecliptic and HE is its latitude. With D as the pole, we draw a great circle passing

 through Y and M, which intersects the ecliptic and the meridian, respectively, at Κ
 and L (LTKY = 90°; arc KYM = 90°).

 altitude, not measured with the clepsydra. With our author's parameters, i.e., the geographical latitude of
 Maragha φ = 37;20,30°, the obliquity of the ecliptic ε = 23.5°, and A© = 37; 15,46°, half the sun's
 apparent diurnal motion = I00;56,31° (and so, half the duration of daylight = 6;43,46h; our author later

 gives 6;43,31 h) and, therefore, the sun's hour angle when it had the altitude h = 2° was 98; 18,46°.

 The arc DB is the altitude of the mid-heaven: hmy = 31 ;30°. For the lunar apparent
 altitude ZB = /i'max = 28;34°, our author calculates the lunar parallax (i.e., the
 arc HZ) as 77 = 1 ; 15° (cf. below, Sect. 4.3). Then the lunar true altitude is Η Β —
 /ζmax = 29:49°. As a result,

 In the spherical triangle KYT, YT = 24;31,12 + 2;37,20 = 27;8,32°. LKTY is the
 obliquity of the ecliptic, ε = 23;30°. Using the sine rule, we have KY = 10;29°.
 TC = YC — YT = 90 — 27;8,32 = 62:51,28°. Then the right ascension of the mid
 heaven is /?A(-imid) = 360 — 62;51,28 = 297;8,32°. Interpolating in our author's
 table of the right ascension (fol. 34v), we then have:

 Since L TCD = LYKT = 90°, we have:

 S. M. Mozaffari

 In order to determine the lunar longitude, we should compute the arc DE. We know arc
 DE = 90° - LEML. Now, in the triangle MHL, MH = 90° - EH = 88;21°, LH =
 90° — DH = 88;19°, and LHLM = 90°; thus, using the sine rule in the triangle
 HLM, L HML = 89;39,11° [89;40°], Therefore, DE = 0;20,49° [0;20°]. Now, from

 (34), the longitude of the moon is calculated as

 ^ = /Ud - DE = 295;10,48 - 0;20,49 = 294;49,59°. (38)

 The ecliptical coordinates computed by our author, compared with the modern ones,
 are summarized as follows:

 Muhyï al-Dïn 37;15,46° 294;49,59° -1;39°

 Our author gives the mean longitudes of the sun and moon for mean noon of April

 20, 1264 at Maragha as Â© = 35;55,4° and χ , = 305;33,19°; then ή = 269;38,15°.
 Thus, a distance of y = 0;21,45° should be travelled by both the mean sun and the

 mean moon until the last mean quadrature occurs when they are located in the angular

 distance of ή = 270° from each other (Fig. 6). We wish to know how long it will take.

 time = 1264 April 20, 12:25:0 MLT

 X0 = 35;56,34°
 A, = 305;56,34°

 As it is obvious, our author's value for the time of the last mean quadrature has an

 error of about +18 min.

 Our author gives half the hours of daylight as 6:43,31h [true ^ 6;40h]. Thus, the

 time of the last mean quadrature is 6:43,31 + 0;42,48 = 7:26,19h after sunrise and
 7:26,19 — (2;37,20 χ 24/360) «s 7:15,50h after the instant of the observation [above

 (33)]. The moon travels an arc of 3;59,17° along the ecliptic during 7;15,50h.41 Thus,

 from (39), the true longitude of the moon at the instant of the last mean quadrature is

 A, = 294;49,59+3;59,17 = 298;49,16° (42)

 Therefore, the difference between the lunar true and mean longitudes, (41) and
 (42), is

 Aj-Aj = 7;7,32°

 (43)

 4i Note that when the last mean quadrature occurred [above. (41)], the moon had an anomaly near 100°
 (see below), and so the line of sight to it was tangential to the epicycle. Thus, the lunar epicyclic equation
 was maximum, and therefore, its true motion was equal to its mean motion.

 Fig. 7 The measurement of the

 Ptolemaic lunar model. Redrawn

 based on the diagram drawn by
 al-Maghribï on fol. 77r

 Ε E

 We know that this is the amount of the angle subtended by the lunar epicycle radius at

 the earth's center (or the same epicyclic equation of the moon) at the instant of the last
 mean quadrature. In the end of Sect. 3.1, we have calculated that if the moon revolves

 on a zero-eccentricity deferent, the radius of the lunar epicycle should always appear

 under the angle 4;58° from the earth. Thus, the center of the moon's deferent does not

 evidently coincide with that of the earth. Our author is well aware of this as well as the

 fact that the epicyclic equation will catch its maximum amount at mean quadratures.

 In order to measure the lunar eccentricity e, our author draws Fig. 7 (or extracts
 it from Almagest V, 4),42 in which the earth is at D. We previously assumed that the
 lunar deferent is a circle with center D, whose radius AD is taken as R = 60, but it is

 now known that the center C of the lunar deferent is displaced from D. Thus, CD is the

 lunar eccentricity. We want to obtain the magnitude of CD in terms of AD = R = 60.
 Through the Almagest, we know that at mean quadrature, the center of the lunar
 epicycle is located at the perigee Β of its eccentric. If the moon (Z) has an anomaly (arc

 EZ) at that time such that the line DZ is tangential to the epicycle, then the epicyclic
 equation (LBDZ) will be maximum. In the triangle DZB, ADBZ = 180° — LZBE,
 where LZBE is the lunar anomaly, our author gives a = 100;29,59° for the time
 of the last mean quadrature [above (41)]; then LDBZ = 79;30,1°. And from (43),
 LBDZ = 7;7,32°. Thus, I DZB = 93;22,27°. BZ is the radius of the epicycle, i.e.,
 r = 5; 12 in terms of R = 60. Using the sine rule results BD = 41 ;51. Our author
 rounds this to the nearest integer number, i.e., BD = 42. Thus, AB = 60 + 42 = 102.
 Therefore, the radius of the lunar eccentric deferent, AC, is calculated as 51, and the

 lunar eccentricity, CD, as

 e = 9 [Ptolemy (also adopted in Taj al-azyaj) : 10; 19]. (44)

 Then, the maximum amount of the lunar epicyclic equation ("second equation") will

 be equal to sin-1 (5; 12/42) % 7;8°[7;7°], This is the case when at mean quadrature,

 the line passing through the centers of the earth and moon is tangential to its epicycle.

 And the difference between the maximum values of the second equation of the moon

 when the center of its epicycle is located at the eccentric apogee and at the eccentric
 perigee will be 7;8 — 4;58 = 2;10° [Ptolemy: 2;39°].

 3.4 Prosneusis and the mean epicylic apogee in the Ptolemaic lunar model

 In chapter 10 (fols. 77v-80r), our author introduces the last component of the Ptolemaic

 lunar model, i.e., prosneusis. This step is also like the testing of the model. In doing

 so, he makes use of his observation of the meridian transit of the moon on Friday,

 August 29, 1264, when the moon was near mean octant (Table 3).

 The method of the determination of the ecliptical coordinates of the moon at the time

 of the observation is as described above, Sect. 3.3. In order to compute the longitude

 of the mid-heaven, our author first gives the solar mean longitude for the time of the
 observation as

 20 = 165; 12,36°. (45)

 So Xq = 163; 16,410, and hence, the right ascension of the solar longitude counted from

 the head of Capricorn is RA(Aq) = 254;35,46°. The revolution of the celestial sphere
 in this time interval is 4·/5 χ 15 = 63;0°. Then /M(Amjd) = 317;35,46° (counted

 from the head of Capricorn). Thus, /m;d = 230;3°. Accordingly, /!mK| = 34;52°. Our

 author gives the lunar parallax in the vertical circle as 77 = 1 ;3° (cf. below, Sect. 4.3).

 Hence, h} = 29;51° and Ah = Amid - A, = 5;1°. With regard to Fig. 8 which depicts
 the celestial sphere with respect to the local horizon at the instant of this observation,
 δ' = sin"1 (sin(317;35,46 - 180) χ sin(23;30)) = 15;35,53° [error % -2"]. We
 have μ = 90° — 8' (cf. (36) and Fig. 5). Then μ = 74;24,7°. Like the procedure
 already described in Sect. 3.3, the latitude of the moon and the difference χ between

 its longitude and the mid-heaven are determined by solving the highlighted triangles

 in Fig. 8; the results are = -4;49,53° and χ = 1 ;20,48°[1;21,8°]. Also, referring to

 the tables of the lunar mean motions, our author gives the mean and true positions of
 the moon at the instant of this observation as follows:

 Now, our author draws Fig. 9 (fol. 79v) illustrating the orbital components of the
 Ptolemaic lunar model. LAEB is the mean double elongation of the moon; from (45)
 and (46), we have: 2ή = 137; 11,8°. Then, /.BEG = 42;48,52°. Also, if AE = 60,

 then DE = 9 and BD = 51. Thus, using the sine rule in the triangle BDE, we have
 LDBE = 6;53,18°. Also, LBDG = LBEG - LDBE = 35;55,34°. Applying the sine
 rule to the triangle BDE, we have:

 BE = BD ■ Sin(LBDG)/Sin(LAEB) = 44; 1,47 (47)

 From (46), the moon's epicyclic equation at the time of this observation is

 λ -λ J=-2;24,22°, and so, as our author mentions, the line passing through the
 centers of the earth and moon, i.e., EH, is located west of the line EZ. In the triangle
 BEH, BH is the radius of the lunar epicycle r = 5; 12 and ίΖΕΗ = 2;24,22°. Using
 the sine rule, we have: LEHB = 20;49,22° [error % +1"]. Thus,

 LHBZ = LZEH + LEHB = 23; 13,44° (48)

 This is the lunar anomaly. And it is evidently larger than the mean anomaly [cf.

 above, (46)]. From this, it results that the origin of the lunar mean motion in anomaly

 is not the point Z, but the point Τ locating west of Ζ by the distance of 23; 13,44
 — 13;54,8 = 9;19,36°(= LTBZ = LEBY) from it. Then, our author draws the

 line TB and extends it to meet AG at Y. The problem is to verify EY = ED. If
 so, the Ptolemaic lunar model is tested successfully. The proof is as follows: in
 the triangle BEY, LBEG = 42;58,52° and LEYB = 180° - (LBEG + LEBY) =
 127;51,32° [ 127;41,32°]. Then

 EY = BE ■ SmUEBY)/Sm(LEYB) = 9;2 [9; 1 ] (49)

 which is approximately equal to ED, i.e., the Ptolemaic lunar eccentricity, computed

 earlier, cf. (44).

 3.5 The measurement of the inclination of the lunar deferent (= maximum latitude)

 In the end of both chapters 9 (folio. 77v) and 10 (fols. 79v-80r), our author devotes an

 unnumbered chapter to the calculation of the lunar parallax and orbital inclination from

 the data presented above. In order to compute the inclination i of the lunar deferent

 from the empirical data, we return to Fig. 4. AC is the angular distance of the moon from
 the node and BC is its latitude at the instant of the observation. LB = 90°. LB AC is the

 inclination of the lunar deferent. Our author gives λΛ = 314;3° (modern = 3I3;56°)
 for the time of the observation no. 4 (cf. Table 2) from his table of the motion of the

 lunar ascending node. Also, from (39), 1J = 294;50°; thus, ΑΟ = λα-λ} = 19;13°.
 And BC = 1/9jI = 1;39°. Applying the sine rule to the triangle ABC, we have:

 5;2° [5; 1,8°] (50)

 which in full agreement with the modern value calculated for April 20, 1264 AD.

 For the time of the observation no. 5 (cf. Table 3), our author computes λη =

 307;5,40° (modern = 308;18°) from his table. With regard to Fig. 4, from (46):

 S. M. Mozaffari

 AC= λα - Aj = 75;41,52° and BC = \β}\ = 4;49,53°. Applying the sine rule to the
 triangle ABC, we have:

 i« 5° [4;59,11°] (51)

 The modern value for August 29, 1264 is i = 5;11°.

 After computing all of the lunar parameters, our author proceeded to prepare the

 tables for the equations, all of which are for each 10 of argument up to 180° (cf.

 Fig. 1): the table for the "first equation" or the "equation of center": ς(2ή) — c_? and

 the "coefficient of the interpolation" due to the distance between the center of the lunar

 epicycle and that of the earth: C(,(2rj) (fol. 82r); the table for the "second equation"

 or the "epicyclic equation at the eccentric apogee": Pa{ci) = C4 (fol. 82v); the table

 for the "third equation,"43 i.e., the difference between the epicyclic equation at the

 eccentric perigee and at the eccentric apogee: pn(oi) — p\(ot) = C5 (fol. 83r); and

 the last lunar equation tabulated is the equation due to the shift of the moon from the

 inclined eccentric to the ecliptic: C7 (fol. 83v). The table for the lunar latitude is also

 on fol. 83r. The values of cj and the moon's latitude are for the argument of latitude

 λβ = - λΛ. Cf. Tables 4, 5, and 6. In the Adwâr al-anwâr, all of the equations are

 tabulated together (CB: fols. 81 v-82r. The table of the latitude is on fol. 87v).44

 Neither in the Almagest, nor in the Handy Tables, were the amounts of the equation

 C7 tabulated. To our best knowledge, a table for it first appeared in Yahyâ b. AbT
 Mansur's ZTj al-mumtahan 46 He and later Ibn Yflnus gave max(c7) = 0;6,0° for

 λ β = 44°, 45°, and 46°, presumably computed from the value i = 4;46° 47 Al
 MaghribT, in chapter 11, calls cj as "the equation of the inclined sphere of the moon"
 (1ta'dïl al-falak al-ma'il) or "the equation of the shift" (ta'dTl al-naql)48 (fol. 83v) and

 explains how the equation to be calculated:

 ci(Xft) = tan (tan λβ cost) — λβ (52)

 where i = 5°. Accordingly, max(c7) = 0;6,33° for λβ % 45°, while the Muhyi
 al-DTn's table gives 0;6,40° for λρ = 44°, 45°, and 46°. The same table can be found
 in KhâzinT (Zïj, fol. 135r), the ïlkhânî zîj (C: p. 84), KamâlT (fols. 67r and 243v),

 In the other zîjes, it is called the "extra difference."

 44 Our author's tables for the lunar equations can be found in Kamâlï, fols. 243v-251 r. and his values for

 the lunar mean motions on fols. 232v-233r. The tables in Wâbkanawï's zîj are all based on Muhyf al-Dïn's

 parameter values.

 45 Cf. Neugebauer ( 1975, Vol. 2, pp. 988-989).

 46 Cf. Kennedy and Pingree (1981, pp. 168 and 310).

 47 Zîj al-mumtahan has /imax = 4;30° and /imax = 5:0° (fols. 54r and 57r). Habash (fol. 36r) and Bïrûnî
 (al-Qânun, Vol. 2, pp. 776 and 779) have associated i = 4; 46° with the Banîi Mûsâ (cf. below. Sect. 4.2).

 However, Bïrûnî mentions that some people erroneously cast doubt on the correctness of this attribution and

 consider this value as the average of the Indian and Ptolemaic values, respectively, 4 ;30° and 5;0°. Another
 source (Kamâlï, fol. 53v) has attributed /imax = 4;46° to the Mumtahan tradition and /imax = 4:55° to
 Thâbit b. Qurra, 'All b. 'ïsâ, Sanad b. 'All, Khâlid b. 'Abd- al-Malak al-Marwarudhi, and the Banû Musa.

 48 In the other zljes, it is called "the third equation." In the modern astronomy, it is called "the reduction to

 the ecliptic."

 3.6 The measurement of the lunar parallax

 In Talkhts VI, our author deals with the lunar parallax, the solar and lunar distances

 from the earth, and the theory of eclipses (corresponding to Almagest V, 11-16, VI).

 In order to measure the lunar parallax in the circle of altitude, the observation should

 be made when (a) the moon is near the points of the solstices (Λ = 90° or 270°), (b)
 its ascending node is near the points of the equinoxes (λ = 0 or 180°) to cause the
 moon to have the maximum northern or southern latitude, and (c) the moon transits

 the local meridian. Through our author's period of the observations at Maragha, such

 a situation occurred in March 1262.50 In VI, 2 (fols. 85v-86r), He used an observation

 made on March 15, 1262 (Table 7).

 From the tables of the mean motions, he gives the following mean positions for the

 49 Max(t'7) = 0: 6.40° is derived from i = 5: 3° which al-FârisI (fol. 119v) (about him, cf. Pingree 1985,
 pp. 8-9) attributes to Ibn Yunus.

 50 The next appropriate opportunity was on March 19, 1271. Of course, the moon transited the meridian

 of Maragha about 17:47 MLT, before the sunset in ~ 18:15 MLT. Our author's tables give λ «s 89:46.49°
 and ft = —4:59,59° for this time.

 1 Our author's calculation of the lunar declination, instead of taking its amount to be —s — /imax- denotes

 that he by no mean roughly assumed that the longitudinal component of parallax is zero at the instant of
 the observation

 2 This is, of course, not exactly the value of the parallax, owing to the effect of the atmospheric refraction

 which increases the observed altitudes and amounts to 0;2,0° for the apparent altitude = 22:58,41°, with

 considering the weather conditions in this observation: temperature = 10° C and the atmospheric pressure
 = 850 mbar at Maragha with the elevation = 1,550 m from the sea level. Π is therefore approximately
 equal to 0:54.10°

 In TalkhisVl, 3 (fols. 86r-87v), using/î'max = 22;48°and/7 = 1;25,37°, our author
 found that the moon-earth distance at the instant of this observation was 36;59,53

 terrestrial radii (tr). Using R = 60, e % 9, and r — 5; 12, he also calculated that this
 distance is 37;37,42 in terms of R = 60. All of the dimensions of the lunar model

 may then be expressed in the unittr through multiplying them by the factor of

 Then, he instructed the operator how to calculate the lunar parallax from its geo

 centric altitude, elongation, and anomaly by the aid of the table. The table is given for

 the steps of 3°, as in the Handy Table (an extract of this is shown in Table 8).

 In the rest of the book VI, there is nothing else new except three interesting points

 of the sun and moon are equal at their greatest distances from the earth. Neverthe

 less, he found that the minimum apparent diameters of the sun and moon are about

 0;31,8°, instead of Ptolemy's value 0;31,20°. This is not, of course, an observational

 achievement, but the result of a remedy of Ptolemy's computations in Almagest V, 14.

 Ptolemy calculated the apparent diameter of the moon from the data obtained from the

 Babylonian observations of the two lunar eclipses on April 21/22, 621 BC and July

 16/17,523 BC, and arrived at 0;31,20° as the minimum value.51 MuhyT al-DTn realized

 that on the basis of the data given by Ptolemy, in both the eclipses, the moon was not
 at its maximum distance from the earth. As a result, 0;31,20° cannot be the minimum

 amount of the lunar apparent diameter. Based on Ptolemy's data, in these eclipses, the

 lunar anomaly was, respectively, 20° and 28°. Simply adopting the mean value 24°
 results that the moon was in the distance of 64;50 (R = 60) from the earth. Thus, the

 moon's apparent diameter at its greatest distance from the earth should be equal to
 64;50 χ 0;31,20/65; 15 = 0;31,8° (TalkhTs, VI, 6: fols. 94r-v). I do not know another

 medieval astronomer objecting Ptolemy at this point. An indispensable consequence of

 the value 0;31,8° is that the sun's greatest distance from the earth is 1420.5tr (TalkhTs,

 VI, 7: fols. 95r-v) while Ptolemy has 1260tr. The last issue that is worth mentioning

 is the existence of a comprehensive account of the annular solar eclipses (TalkhTs, VI,

 17: fol. 106r). Some scatter (either incidental or passing) allusions to this phenomenon

 prior to al-Maghribî can be addressed; e.g., Simplicius (6th ct.), BTrunT ( 11th ct.), and

 al-Khâzin! (12th ct.), among others.52

 4 Some technical and historical comments

 4.1 Process of measurements

 The way in which our author presented his process of observations and computations

 for measuring the lunar parameters most likely does not cover all of what he in reality

 did to obtain them. It is quite possible that other observations that he performed (esp.

 51 Toomer (1998, pp. 253-254); Pedersen (1974, pp. 208-209).

 52 Simplicius (1894), pp. 504-506 (cf. Bowen 2008, pp. 89-90); Bïrûnî, al-Qânun, Vol. 2, p. 632;
 al-Khâzinl, Wajïz, fol. 28r.

 the other nine lunar eclipses that he may have witnessed; see the quotation in the end

 of Sect. 2), some intervening turns of computation, and/or intermediate results have

 been discarded. He should have started his final computations after he observed the

 third lunar eclipse in 1274. The basic parameters r, ω(, and ωη could then be computed

 (Sects. 3.1,3.2). After doing that, having referred to his recorded observations of 1264

 (Tables 2 and 3), he first calculated e and ωΆ and then examined the Ptolemaic model.

 He most likely dealt with the last computations documented in the Talkhîs in the

 period from August 1274 to December 1276, during which he was also busy with the

 preparation of the tables of second zîj, the Ad weir. Meanwhile, he had thus to work with

 a preliminary set of parameters which resulted from his earlier unrecorded observations

 and undocumented computations at Maragha, were taken from his previous zîj, the Taj

 al-azyâj, or were borrowed from his predecessors. It seems our author was utilizing his

 earlier parameters as well as Ptolemy's. He refers to his Islamic predecessors very

 rarely; besides the observations of the autumnal equinoxes by Yahyà b. AbT Mansur

 (Baghdad) and by al-Marwarûdhï and Sanad b. 'All (Damascus), which he compared

 with his autumnal equinox observation of September 15, 1264 in order to determine

 the length of the tropical year (365; 14,30 days),54 no further allusion to his Islamic

 Our author's step of measurement devoted to determine the value of the maximum

 latitude or the inclination of the orbit of the moon $max = i = 5° (Sect. 3.5) does not

 seem so reasonable because, in order to measure ωΛ (Sect. 3.2), the value βηΥΛΧ = 5°

 has already been used to compute λα in the lunar eclipse no. 3. Now, using the table

 of — Aft, the same value for ωα has in fact been redeployed in order to compute /Jmax.

 Thus, the procedure is indeed circular. It seems our author has only tried to justify

 why he has used the value /?max = 5° which had been accepted from the antiquity to

 the medieval period, and he himself did not attempt to measure this value.

 5-1 For example, the amounts our author gave for the difference in mean anomaly between the two lunar

 eclipses (cf. Sect. 3.1) are better matched with taking Ptolemy's value for <ua to compute them while those

 given for the difference in mean longitude are in better agreement with taking the value adopted in Taj

 al-azyâj for ωχ (the differences are in parentheses):

 Almagest Tâj al-azyâj

 eclipses 1— 2 61;56,16° (+1' 10") 61;56, 9° (+Γ 17")
 eclipses 2—> 3 123;11,27 (+32") 123;11,24 (+35")
 r eclipses 1—► 2 30;54,32 (+2' 46") 30;57, 2 (+16")
 eclipses 2—» 3 277;43, 9 (+Γ 18") 277;44,20 (+7")

 54 The medieval astronomers measured the length of the tropical year with taking the autumnal equinox
 as the zero-point over the long periods. Thus, the result achieved should be considered as a "mean" value.

 The mean value for the length of the tropical year between the two consecutive autumnal equinoxes in the

 period from AD 0 to 2000 is 365; 12,32 days (cf. Meeus 2002, pp. 357-366). Muhyï al-DTn's value is thus

 more exact than those given, say, by Hipparchus/Ptolemy (365; 14,48d), Thâbit b. Qurra (365; 14,24d), and
 al-Battânî (365; 14.26 ); cf. Mozaffari (2013a).

 55 As far as the present author knows, in his mathematical treatises as well as his treatise on the astrolabe,

 he refers to Avicenna (e.g., Hogendijke 1993, p. 134).

 S. M. Mozaffari

 In order to determine the moon's maximum latitude, one has to measure the apparent

 meridian altitude h'max of the moon when its longitude is around 90° and its ascending

 node is near the vernal equinox, because, only under this condition, the lunar parallax

 will have its minimum amount. Then, the maximum latitude will be obtained as βη)αχ =

 h' + Π — (90° — φ + ε).56 One attempt made during the medieval Islamic period for

 measuring /Jmax is that of the Banfl Mûsâ at Baghdad, which has been documented in

 BTrunT's al-Qâniin al-mas'ûdî.

 Date h' ε φ Π β λ·>~λη

 Monday, 28 Âbân 239 Y Banû Musa: 84;53° 23;33° 33;20° 0;5° 4;45° 90-0;3°
 11 Dec. 870 AD, JDN 2039170 Modem: 84;56 23;35 33;20 0;5 4;56 -81

 The altitude value is expressed as 84 + 1/2 + '/3 + '/20> which gives the impres

 sion that the instrument used had maybe been graduated for each 3'. The input data

 are relatively correct and even the parallax had been calculated based on a horizon

 tal parallax 0;56° found in Indian sources, which is more accurate than Ptolemy's

 1 ;26°.58 Nevertheless, the measured β is not βηιαχ, simply because at the instant of the

 observation, the moon was not in λ = 90°, but in λ % 83;26°, and also λα % 2;36°.

 4.3 Lunar parallax in the observations nos. 4 and 5

 Another example to show MuhyT al-DTn working with pre-existing parameters is the

 problem of the lunar parallax confronted in the observations nos. 4 and 5. In order

 to measure the eccentricity as well as to test the Ptolemaic lunar model, one of our

 author's input observational data is the amount of the parallax while it can be calculated

 if and only if the lunar eccentricity, and thus the moon-earth distance are known. In the

 end of his computations as presented above in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4, our author computed

 the amounts of the lunar parallax for the instants of the observations nos. 4 and 5 from

 the distances resulting from the new value e — 9 in order to verify that his input data

 in both observations are correct. The argument appears to be circular again.

 In order to neutralize the effect of parallax on the lunar longitude, the observation

 should be made when the moon's longitude equals the culminating point of the ecliptic.

 In such a situation, the ecliptic will be perpendicular to the lunar altitude circle and

 thus the longitudinal component of parallax becomes zero. As we have already seen

 in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4 and it will also be discussed below {cf. Sect. 4.6), our author

 did not directly measure longitudes, rather he measured the meridian altitude and

 time, and then converted them to the ecliptical coordinates. As a result, in order to

 neutralize the effect of parallax along with utilizing our author's special method, the

 observation should be made when both the ecliptic is perpendicular to the meridian

 and the moon is appreciably near the points of the solstices, i.e., when the culminating

 point of the ecliptic, the mid-heaven, and the longitude of the moon are all equal. This

 situation occurs in observations like those employed to determine the maximum lunar

 latitude or parallax (e.g., the observation no. 6). Of course, it should also satisfy the

 other two conditions mentioned in the beginning of Sect. 3.3. Such a situation occurs

 very rarely and also gathering all conditions to allow doing such a measurement is

 very hard to achieve. For instance, in the observation no. 6 (Table 7), the moon was

 near, but not exactly in λ = 270° and so the ecliptic was not firmly perpendicular

 to the local meridian. Moreover, at that instant, the moon's anomaly was a % 156°,

 far from the epicyclic quadrature. This observation could thus not serve for such a

 purpose.

 Nevertheless, there may be an explanation for decoding the text at this point. It

 comes from our author's style of rounding in the case of the value obtained for the

 minimum distance between the lunar epicycle center and the earth: he computed

 BD = 41 ;51 (Fig. 7) and rounded it to 42 and, as a result, e = 9 is given instead of

 e = 9;4,30 (R = AD = 60). This gives impression that he started out the computation

 from some already-existed values for the lunar parallax to obtain an estimate for, or

 to find the amplitude of the variation in, e. It may simply be shown that the Ptolemaic

 value for the lunar parallax in the altitude circle in a situation similar to the observations

 no. 4 is not more than 77 = 1 ; 19°.59 Working with the latter value (i.e., more than
 our author's value by 4') makes a difference of +0;3,11° in [cf. (38)] and so a

 difference of-0;3,l Γ inXj- i.e.,7;4,21° instead of 7;7,32° (cf. (43)). Therefore,
 BD = 42;9,29 % 42 and hence e = 8;55,16 % 9. (Note that working even with
 the drastically deviated values like 77 = 1 ;0° and 1 ;30°, making the differences of

 —0;0,17° and +0;5,110 in λ , respectively, do not result in a rounded value other than

 e 9, i.e., 9;5 and 8;49, respectively.) This could make our author confident that e

 should be around 9, but he was probably and naturally not certain about its sexagesimal

 fractions. This appears to be the reason why our author gave the final result only in

 an integer number. It is deserved to notice that our author was likely aware of the fact

 that any change in the value of e by some minutes has a negligible effect on the lunar

 longitude.

 4.4 Equation of time

 The mean time intervals between the two eclipses [cf. Sect. 3.1 and 3.2(21)] contain

 the amounts due to the equation of time60, which must be taken into account in order

 to compute the true time intervals between them. The longitude values should also

 be modified by the correction amounts resulting from the equation of time. We have

 already shown that Àq recalculated for the instant of the maximum phase of the eclipse

 59 The center of the epicycle is at the perigee of the eccentric deferent (mean quadrature), and the moon
 is near its maximum elongation from it; so, the moon-earth distance Δ = 0;59 χ ((60 - 2 χ 10;I9)2 -
 5;I52)'/2 = 38:21,53 terrestrial radii. Thus, with h' = 28:34°, Π = sin_l(cosA'/4) I ; 19°.

 60 Equation of days (Ar. ta'dïl al-ayyûm. La. equatio dierum) in the medieval astronomical context. How

 ever, it may be noted that the modern term "equation of time" (Ar. ta'dïl al-zamân) may be found in Ibn

 Yunus, p. 92 (line 13) and Bïrûnî, Vol. 2, p. 720; cf. Neugebauer 1975, Vol. 1, p. 61 (n. 2).

 no. 1 based on our author's tables coincides precisely with the value given by him (cf.

 note 22) as well as appreciably with the modern one. Following the same procedure

 to calculate Iq for the other two eclipses results in the values given by our author

 (Col. 6 of Table 1 ). It thus seems that the correction due to equation of time has been

 neglected in each instance. This is apparently a consequence of the fact that our author

 did not believe that the equation of time exists. Wâbkanawï reports that "if the day is

 counted from one midday to the next, the difference occurring in the [length] of days is

 only due to the equation of days [i.e., equation of time] according to the opinion of the

 majority of astronomers, except Mawlànà [i.e., our master] Muhyl al-DTn al-Maghribl.

 He believed that it does not exist. In his MajistT, he has presented a proof for his claim.

 And [in this case,] the opinion of the majority [of the astronomers] is correct."61

 Accordingly, a table of the equation of time is found neither in the TalkhTs, nor in the

 Adwâr. Although such a crude opinion indeed appears to be unjustifiable, it may be

 found at least in one other work from the thirteenth century: Kamàli reports concerning

 the ZTj al-MughnT written by a certain Muntakhab al-Dïn Sakkàk (or Hakkâk) of Yazd

 (a city in central Iran) that its author did not put any difference between the mean and

 true solar days.62

 4.5 Instruments

 As we have already seen, our author's observational data are altitudes and times of

 day. The majority of our author's meridian altitude measurements, as explicitly men

 tioned by him in each case, were performed by the aid of the central quadrant of the

 observatory63 (engraved for each 0.5'), and most of the times by a clepsydra (see
 below).

 Our author does not specify the instrument utilized for measuring the altitudes in the

 observations nos. 4-6. Although four of the large-sized instruments constructed in the

 observatory were altitude-azimuthal, only one of them, the so-called having the two

 quadrants, could be used for simultaneous observations of the horizontal coordinates

 of two celestial objects that appear in any angular distant from each other in the sky,

 as it is the case with the observations nos. 4 and 5.64 We may thus suggest that the

 instrument "having the two quadrants" was utilized in the observations nos. 4-6, and

 61 WabkanawT, II, 1, ا : Τ: fol. 16r; Y: fol. 26ν. The Μajistl to which Wabkanawi refers is probably MuhyT
 al-DTn's Khulasa which is now lost.

 62 KamalT, fol. 52U. In other sources, the work has been ascribed to 'Abd al-Karim al-Fahhad (cf. Kennedy

 1956, no. 64). The two works may, however, be independent from each other.

 63 Muhyi al-DIn appears to have been so interested in the central quadrant that composed a poem during

 the observations of 1265 6 AD to praise it, which a certain The Astrologer Majd al-DTn Abu Muhammad

 al-Hasan b. Ibrahim b. Yusflf al-Ba'albakT had engraved on the instrument (cf. Ibn al-FuwatT 1995, Vol. 4,
 pp. 413414):

 انا يع دائرة الفك / طول لن مِئني ملك_، / ل تدركا ألاوقات حمأ / و ينينأ دون شك،

 64 Cf. Seemann (1929). The other two instruments could be used in order to measure simultaneously

 the horizontal coordinates of the two celestial objects having the diametrical opposed azimuths. The last

 instrument was solely applicable to the measurement of the coordinates of one object in a given time.

 more likely in other similar cases. Based on the times that our author gives for the

 observations nos. 4-6 (Tables 2, 3, and 7), it is evident that the moon had yet about

 one-two degrees of azimuth to travel until it reached the meridian of Maragha. This

 type of systematic error suggests the occurrence of a misalignment of about one degree
 toward the east in the meridian line marked on the azimuth circle of the instrument

 "having the two quadrants." The error in the altitude of the sun and of the moon in

 observations nos. 4 and 5 was around ±10' and ±20', respectively, and that of the
 moon in observation no. 6 around —10'.

 Muhyl al-DTn frequently referred to the application of a clepsydra or water-clock in

 his systematic observations. In Persian, the term pangân was used to refer to clepsy

 dra,65 which was Arabicized both as bankâm and as fankân in the Islamic period; the

 first was utilized to name "water-clock," in particular, and the latter was employed to

 call "clock," in general. Al-Maghribï, however, mentions the name of the clepsydra as

 mankâm which seems to be a corruption of bankâm. Based on the information given

 by al-Maghribl, one may only speculate about its calibrations, but nothing more is

 known on its structure. The clepsydra used in al-Maghribl's observations, of course,

 appears to have been of a good accuracy, so that it could fix the time intervals with

 a precision of only a few minutes (in the case of the lunar eclipses: error % +5 min;

 cf. Sect. 2). It may be mentioned that the use of the clepsydras having compound

 mechanical components was well established in Chinese astronomy since, at least, the

 eleventh century.66 Due to the verified cultural relations between the two realms of

 Mongolian empire (i.e., Iran and China) and, especially, considering the fact that the

 Chinese astronomers (at least, a Fu Mengchi or Fu Muzhai) worked at the Maragha

 observatory,67 perhaps, there was a connection between the clepsydra of the Maragha
 observatory and the Chinese elaborated technology of making time-measuring
 devices.

 4.6 Al-Maghribi's method of obtaining the ecliptical coordinates

 The observational data achieved were converted to the ecliptical coordinates which

 served as the input data for the computation (cf. Sects. 3.3 and 3.4). We are not told

 the reason why our author preferred coping with this relatively lengthy process of

 doing computations over utilizing an armillary sphere through which he could read

 off the ecliptical coordinates directly. It is probable that he saw some difficulties in

 working with the instrument.68 Throughout the treatise, the use of the armillary sphere

 is only mentioned in a passage in VII, 4, which is in fact a quotation from Almagest IX,

 269 related to the observations of the planetary conjunctions with the stars. We know

 65 Pangân was originally a simple inflow clepsydra (cf. Mozaffari 2013b, p. 256. n. 80); Wâbkanawï uses

 this term to refer to the clepsydra; see below. Sect. 5; also, cf. Mozaffari (2013b, pp. 256-257).

 66 E.g., cf. Needham (1981, p. 136).

 67 Cf. van Dalen 2002a, esp. p. 334,2002b; 2004b.

 68 In the Ghâzdn 's treatise on observational instruments (see note 20), the adequacy of the classic instru

 ments described in the Almagest is rejected for the various reasons; in the case of the armillary sphere,
 cf. Mozaffari and Zotti (2012, pp. 400-401).

 69 Toomer (1998, p. 423, lines 10-13).

 S. M. Mozaffari

 that a model of the armillary sphere had more likely been built in the observatory

 (radius of its ecliptic ring % 200 cm). MuhyT al-DTn's specific treatment produced

 some restrictions on his measurements. For instance, when dealing with the stellar

 measurements in the Talkhïs, he complains that

 "it is not possible for us to observe either Vega (a Lyrae) or Capella (a Aurigae),
 both of which transit the circle of meridian in its northern direction, because

 there is no northern quadrant [established] on the meridian line in this auspicious,

 blessed observation[-al program]."70

 4.7 Historical values

 The more important values obtained for the lunar parameters by medieval Islamic
 astronomers in the Middle East are summarized in Table 9. As it may evidently
 be seen, some of these astronomers obtained values around MuhyT al-DTn's r =
 5; 12 (corresponding to max(c4) = 4;58°). Accordingly, it should not be con
 sidered as a sheer novel value (however, the independent result of a new set
 of observational data). Ibn al-A'lam's max(c4) = 4;51° is found in MuhyT al
 DTn's Tâj al-azyâj.1} Although it is possible that he adopted it from Ibn al
 A'lam, it may also be the fruit of an independent observation done in Damas
 cus, like his independently measured value max(c4) = 4;58°. The existence of
 other new parameters in the Tâj al-azyâj gives a preference to the latter possibil

 ity.

 To my best knowledge, only two Islamic astronomers besides our author presented

 their observational data of a trio of lunar eclipses and explained how a value for r
 could be computed from them: al-BTrûnï in al-Qânûn al-mas'ûdï(the lunar eclipses
 of AD 1003-4)72 and al-Kàshï in Khâqânt zîj (the lunar eclipses of AD 1406-7).7:!
 Considering the new values for e in the Islamic period, it may be mentioned that

 BTrunT's e = 10;51 is not a value obtained from independent observations, but is the

 fruit of a remedy of Ptolemy's computations in Almagest V, 3 (see below). The other

 value is e = 10;23 adopted in Ulugh Beg's Sultânîzîj. Nevertheless, other than MuhyT

 al-DTn's, no account of the measurement of e from independent observational data

 appears to exist.

 70 Al-Maghribï, Talkhîs, fol. 114v. The declinations of Vega and Capella were about, respectively, +44°
 51.5' and +38° 17.5' at the time, and thus both transited the Maragha's meridian (φ = 37;23,46°) in its

 northern half. The non-Ptolemaic star table of Ïlkhânï Zlj includes the coordinates of both Vega and Capella

 (al-TQsî, C: p. 195, T: fol. lOOr).

 Indians and 5;0° to Buzarjumihr denoting pre-Islamic Persian astronomy (the tradition

 [3] Ibn Yunus, pp. 121/176. From maxfo) = 4;48°, r = 5;1,14 % 5; 1. Ibn Yûnus
 has max(c) = 7;38,34° (the sum of C4(98) = 4;47,34 and max(cs) = c.<s(98) =
 2;51). Note that these numbers are not in agreement with each other because one

 simply obtains from max(c4) = 4;48° and max(c) = 7;38,34°, e % 11 ;7 rather than

 e % 10; 19. It seems that Ibn Yunus accepted the value max(cs) = 2;51° to keep
 the maximum amount of the lunar epicyclic equation near the Ptolemaic value 7;40°

 without examining carefully whether or not they are in agreement with each other. See
 also below, Table 12, for Ibn Yunus' values for the lunar mean motions.

 [4] Bîrûnï computed r = 5; 11,43,36 from his observations of the three lunar

 eclipses occurred in the period of AD 1003^4 (al-Qânûn, Vol. 2, pp. 742-743, mis

 printed as 4;...) and obtained r % 5; 13,45 from the data preserved by Ptolemy
 for the three Babylonian eclipses (Almagest IV, 11) (ibid., pp. 736/746, misprinted
 as 4;18,...and 5;38,..., respectively). He, however, gave r = 5;11,45,17 (ibid.,
 p. 747, misprinted as 5;41,...) as his last result, from which he derived max(c4) =

 4;58,4,38° and rounded it to 4;58,5° (ibid., p. 792). His tables are asymmetrical, giv
 ing Min = 0;1,55° and Max = 9;58,5°, from which max(c_i) = 4;58,5° is indeed

 resulted. BTrunT did not attempt to measure the lunar second anomaly and thus its
 eccentricity. He, who shows the considerable reliance upon the observations of the

 Banu Musâ, mentions that it was not possible to the Banû Musâ to measure carefully
 the lunar second anomaly, presumably because at the instant of the observation, "the

 moon was far distant from the qudrature." Nevertheless, the value of the lunar second

 anomaly was roughly determined to be 2;40 ± 0;48°. Thus, "since we do not find,"

 Bîrûnï says, "the amount on which we can rely, we return back to Ptolemy's com

 putation and scrutinize it in the AlmagestHe examined Ptolemy's calculations to

 determine the amount of the second lunar anomaly on the basis of the two observa

 tions made by Hipparchus and Ptolemy himself (Almagest V, 3) and obtained a value
 different from Ptolemy's, i.e., max(c) = 7;48,8°, and hence a "non-Ptolemaic" value

 e «s 10;51 (ibid., pp. 793-794). He then computed <7max — 13;50,2° (ibid., p. 803; the
 correct amount is 14;IO0).74 From his asymmetrical table with Min = 1;2,48° and
 Max = 28;50,2°, qmax = 13;53,37° resulted, however.

 74 Based on the wrong assumption (likely from the false analogy drawn between the Ptolemaic lunar and

 planetary models) that q reaches its maximum when the line dropped from the epicycle's center to the
 prosneusis is perpendicular to the apsidal line.

 [6] KâshT, ΙΟ: fols. 132v-133r; Ρ: pp. 132/135. His tables gives max(c) %7;42,19°
 (= the sum of C4(98) = 5;2,26° and C5(98) = 2;39,53°), nearly in agreement with the
 desired value 7;42,27°.

 [7] There is a table in Ulugh Beg's Sultânîzïj giving the distance Δ of the moon from
 the earth when ή — 0: Zimax = 65;12,24and 4mjn = 54;47,36, then r = 5; 12,24 (PI :

 fol. 131 ν; P2: fol. 150v). The table for C3 (PI: fol. 128r;P2:fol. 143v) is asymmetrical,

 giving cij(0) = 13; 15,34°, c^( 114) = 26;31,8° and c\;(246) = 0. It is obvious that
 the constant k = 13; 15,34° has been added to all of the entries of the correspond
 ing symmetrical table, C3, to produce the asymmetrical table: = c3 + k. Thus,
 max(c3) = C3( 116) = 13; 15,34°, and hence e % 10;23. A re-computation of the

 table with e & 10,23 as the underlying parameter produces the results which are in

 excellent agreement with the entries of the original table (see Table 10; wherever there

 is a divergence between the tabulated and the corresponding true values, the difference

 (although all are about a few arc-seconds) is given within parentheses).

 5 The historical and the modern testing of the times of the lunar synodic
 phenomena computed from the parameters of the zîjes of the Maragha
 tradition

 al-Dïn's tables, i.e., taking the tabulated accumulation of the mean motions and inter

 polating in the tables of the equations, for a month since the epoch (i.e., from 17

 January through February 16, 1232). Table 12 summarizes the epoch values for the

 mean longitude and mean anomaly of the moon and the longitude of its orbital ascend

 ing node as given by al-Maghribl (for mean noon of 5/13/600 Y, 17 January 1232,
 JDN 2171062, at Maragha; cf. above, (32)) as well as in the îlkhânï zïj (for mean
 noon of 1/1/601 Y, 18 January 1232 at Maragha). The lunar mean positions of the

 îlkhânï zïj for January 17, 1232 are simply produced by subtracting the daily mean

 motions given in the zïj from its mean positions at the epoch. The comparison with
 the modern values obviously shows that both the epoch values for the lunar mean

 longitude are nearly of the same accuracy (error % —11 ' in the case of MuhyT al

 DTn and —9' in the case of the Îlkhânï zïj). But the îlkhânï zïj has a better value
 for the lunar mean anomaly at the epoch (error « —23') than al-Maghrib! (error

 % +3° 44'). Considering the epoch values for the longitude of the lunar ascending

 node, al-Maghribl has a bit more accurate value (error % +7') than the îlkhânïzïj (error
 % +14').

 The underlying parameters of the îlkhânï zïj, as its author clearly says in the

 prologue,75 had been borrowed from the z[jes of Ibn al-A'lam and Ibn Yunus. Of

 course, both r and e in the îlkhânï zïj are Ptolemaic,76 and thus none of the 'new'
 values observed by Ibn Yunus and Ibn al-A'lam {cf. Table 9, nos. 2 and 3) are
 employed in it. It thus seems that al-Tûsî refers to the mean motions adopted in

 the îlkhânï zïj. Table 13 summarizes Ibn Yunus's solar and lunar mean motions in a

 Persian/Egyptian year given in the canons of his zïj, the daily mean motions result

 ing from them (I), and the rounded values tabulated in his zïj (II)77 in comparison

 with the îlkhânï zïj (III), Ptolemy (IV), and MuhyT al-DTn (V). Therefore, the mean

 motions of the sun and moon in the îlkhânï zïj appear to have been borrowed from Ibn

 Yunus. However, this conclusion needs a further mathematical analysis to be verified

 completely.78

 75 AI-TOsï, C: p. 7, T: fol. 3r.

 76 All of the tables for the lunar equations are asymmetric giving (i)max(ci,) = 13;8°, (ii) c'4 = 7;40° for

 the arguments 0, 180°, and 360° and max(c^) = (265) = 12;41,0° (thus, max(t'4) = 5;1°), and (iii)
 max(t'5) = 2;39°. Cf. al-Tûsï, C: pp. 67-85; Ρ: fol. 23v-28v; M: fols. 40r-50v.

 77 Ibn Yûnus, pp. 120, 158, 160, 162.

 78 For the solar daily mean motion, Wâbkanawl's Zîj has evidentially the same value obtained by al
 Maghribï, i.e., oiq = 0;59,8,20,8,4,36,38°/d (cf. WâbkanawT, Τ: fol. 149r). Also, al-Kâshî's value for wq
 is Ibn Yûnus' (Khûqânîzîj, IO: fol. 128v, gives the solar mean motion in a Persian year as 359;45,40,4°;

 cf. Table 14). Al-Kâshî's adoption of this value appears to be a consequence of his project of the revision

 of the Ilkhânîzîj. Support comes from the fact that the solar maximum equation of center and eccentricity
 in al-Kâshfs zîj (10: fol. 13lr, 157r) are Ibn Yûnus', as is in the ïlkhânî zîj. Al-Kâshï did not, of course,
 mention his source.

 (1) Counted from the apogee. (2) The table has 226;46,22°, but since the table for

 C4 is asymmetric giving ^(0) = +7;40°, it is evident that all of the mean longitudes
 were decreased by 7;40° and then tabulated; thus, 226;46,22 + 7;40 = 234;26,22°.
 This is in agreement with the tabulated value for the double mean elongation at the

 epoch, 220;50,31°, because the ïlkhmïïzîj has the solar mean anomaly at the epoch =

 215;36,15° and the longitude of the solar apogee at the epoch = 86;24,210 and gives an

 asymmetric table for the solar equation of center, whose maximum value is +2;0,30°.79

 Then, the sun's mean position at the epoch is 304; 1,6°. Therefore, the moon's double

 mean elongation at the epoch is 2 χ (234;26,22 — 304; 1,6) = 220;50,31°. (3) Table

 has 245; 1,27° and the table for C3 is asymmetric giving c'3(0) = +13;8°. It is then
 known that all of the entries of the table for the lunar mean anomaly were decreased

 by 13;8° and then tabulated; therefore, 245; 1,27 + 13;8 = 258;9,27°.

 A good time after the two zyes, i.e., al-Maghribl's Ad war and the IlkhânT zTj,

 appeared, al-Zïj al-muhaqqaq al-sultânï (completed between 1316 and 1324) was
 written by Shams al-DTn Muhammad al-Khwâja Shams al-Munajjim al-Wâbkanawï

 al-Bukhârî at the Maragha observatory.80 The period of WâbkanawT's observations,

 as he himself says, extended over 40 years. The first observation documented in his

 ztj is the measurement of the lunar altitude on 3 December 1272, which, as he explic

 itly mentioned, had been done at Maragha and shows that he was there at least since

 1272 8i jjjg ]ast observation documented is that of the triple conjunctions of the two

 superior planets, i.e., Jupiter and Saturn, in 1305-6 (we are not told the place of this

 observation).82 Meanwhile, he mentioned the observation of the annulareclipse of
 30 January 1283 in Mughân83 and that of the great conjunction of 1286 (the place

 of the observation was not given).84 Based on the explanations given in the prologue

 79 It is borrowed from Ibn Yunus' zij (p. 174), corresponding to the solar eccentricity = 2;6,10 (R = 60).

 80 For a biographical outline of him, cf. van Dalen (2007). About his zij and some studies of it, cf. Kennedy

 211) employed the explanations given by WâbkanawT as regards the Maragha observatory to verify some

 remarks by al-Kâshî in a letter to the latter's father and, in another paper (1962, p. 24), quoted a section of

 the zTj related to chronology and astrology.

 of the zîj, these observations were mainly focused on testing the data derived from the

 various zîjes against observations. With regard to his explanations, it appears he paid

 considerable attention to test the ïlkhânî zîj, which was regarded as the main achieve

 ment of the observatory, and Muhyï al-Dïn's Adxvâr against the observations. He gives

 the numerical results concerning his comparative studies. He finally was convinced

 that the times of the occurrence of the astronomical phenomena such as conjunctions

 and oppositions as well as the planetary ecliptical coordinates calculated based on the

 ïlkhânî zîj did not coincide with the data derived from the observations, and added

 that, especially in the case of magnitudes and the instants of the eclipses' phases,

 heavy disagreements and evident differences were observed.85 Conversely, the Adwâr

 al-anwâr gave the results in good agreement with the observations, which persuaded

 him to adopt all of Muhyï al-Dïn's new values for the Ptolemaic parameters in his

 zîj: "we observed all of them [i.e., the previously mentioned phenomena] based on

 the principles established in this zîj and found the calculated [position and/or time] in

 agreement with the observed [position and/or time]."86 He also strictly criticized the

 ïlkhânî zîj especially for the reason that its fundamental planetary parameters were

 adopted from earlier zijes. He referred to Muhyï al-Dïn's Adwâr as based on "the

 New llkhanid Observations" (i.e., Muhyï al-Dïn's own observations) for the sake of

 making a distinction between it and the ïlkhânî zîj which was assumed to be obtained

 through the "llkhanid Observations" (i.e., the observational program supervised by

 85 Wâbkanawî, Τ: fol. 2v, Y: fol. 3v. Concerning the conjunctions, the differences that Wâbkanawî found are:

 Mars and Saturn: in the period of direct motion of Mars: 6 days

 in the period of retrograde motion of Mars: 8 days

 Mars and Jupiter: in the period of direct motion of Mars: 5 days

 al-Tûsï and performed by his colleagues). Wâbkanawï, as he himself says in his zTf s

 introduction, attempted to correct the minor disagreements found in "the principles of

 the Ilkhântd observations" (i.e., al-Maghribï's parameters) with regards to the results

 which, our author claims, had been obtained from observations during his 40-year

 career. One of them is the increase in MuhyT al-DTn's value for the mean longitude

 of the moon by 0; 13,11°, which is equivalent to a difference of about 24min in the

 arrival of the mean moon at a specific longitude between the times computed from

 al-Maghribï's and WâbkanawT's zTjes.^ As a result, for the synodic phenomena such

 as new moons or full moons, it is expected that the times computed from WâbkanawT's

 zîj precede those obtained from al-Maghribî's.

 That the author has presented such quantitative conclusions is significant and here

 is an appropriate opportunity to check them by means of testing the values derived

 from Ilkhânî zîj and al-Maghribï's Adwâr/Talkhîs against the true modern values.89

 In doing so, the times of the new moons for 135 lunations during the 1270s (from

 December 24, 1269 through November 24, 1280) were computed from the three zTjes,

 MuhyT al-DTn's, Ïlkhânîzïj, and WâbkanawT's, and then the found errors were plotted

 in the graphs of Fig. lOa-c, respectively.90 The mean values of the errors are, respec

 tively, + 18.3, +21.3, and -7.3 min. In 85 cases (i.e., 62.5 percent), Wâbkanawï has

 considerably better values than al-Maghribï. Accordingly, WâbkanawT's modification

 of al-Maghribï's value for the mean longitude of the moon seems to have improved

 the times computed.

 Wâbkanawï could test the theoretical values against the observations of the lunar

 eclipses in a sufficiently long period. He did so, as he claims, during his 40-year

 career. From the early 1270s to the end of the 1310s, the 15 lunar total eclipses were

 observable at their maximum phases from Maragha (cf. Table 14). Let us assume that
 Wâbkanawï had observed them. What could he find then? We know that he had access

 to a clepsydra called Pangân, maybe the same model of which al-Maghribï made use.

 We already estimated its accuracy to be about 5 min (cf. Sect. 4.5). In his zîj (IV, 15,

 87 E.g., Wâbkanawî, III, 3, I : Τ: fol. 53r, Y: fol. 96r; III, 9,5: Τ: fol. 60r, Y: fol. I08v; III, 13,6: T: fol. 67r,

 Y: fol. 120v. Since Wâbkanawî contends the Îlkliânlzîj to be majorly based on earlier astronomical tables,

 rather than obtained from making independent observations, he goes further to call only Muhyî al-Dïn's
 Adwàr as the "ïlkhànid Observations." Cf. Wâbkanawî, Τ: fol. 3r, Y: fol. 4v.

 88 The other three modifications made by Wâbkanawî are concerning ( I ) the mean longitude of Mars

 (increased by I ;5°), (2) the mean anomaly of Venus (increased by 2;30°), and (3) the latitudes of the two

 inferior planets; cf. Wâbkanawî, Τ: fol. 3r; Y: fol. 4v; P: fols. 4r-v. Wâbkanawî also differently arranged

 the entries of al-Maghribî's equations tables.

 89 The modern values in this paper are extracted from the software Alcyone, applying the estimates of

 Morrison and Stephenson 2004 for ΔΤ (the difference between the Dynamical Time and Universal Time).

 90 For the present study, a PC-program was used, which can compute the solar, lunar, and planetary ecliptical

 coordinates; the times of the synodic phenomena; etc, from the three zTjes of the Maragha tradition. In this

 program, the equations, of course, are computed from the corresponding trigonometric formulas, instead

 of interpolating in the equations tables of these zijes. The differences, however, are small enough to be less

 effective when testing a historical claim. In addition, rendering ineffective the errors and/or differences in

 the equations tables, this procedure makes a unified scale in order to make the comparison merely between

 the two sets of the parameter values adopted in these three zijes.

 Note 1 : Due to the 5° inclination of the moon's orbit to the ecliptic, the maximum phase of a lunar eclipse

 does not always occur exactly at the time when the moon is in opposition to the sun, except in the case of

 central lunar eclipses when the lunar latitude is zero (cf. Meeus 2002, p. 397). Jabir b. Aflah noticed this

 difference (cf. Bellver 2008, p. 63). Some medieval astronomers instructed how to take the inclination of

 the lunar orbit into account in order to compute a more accurate value for the duration of the phases of an
 eclipse (e.g., Wâbkanawi, HI, 11,4: T: fol. 63r, Y: fol. I I4r, P: fol. 96r)
 Note 2: The computation of the parameters of the lunar eclipse May 30, 1295, for the latitude of Tabriz

 may be found in the chapter 36 of the Greek translation of Ibn al-Fahhâd 'Ala l zîj (c. 1172) made based

 on the oral instructions of a Persian astronomer called Σάμψ Πουχαρής (=Shams al-Bukhârï, who may
 perhaps be identified as Wâbkanawi) to Gregory Chioniades (cf. Pingree 1985. 352ff). The computation
 of the parameters of this lunar eclipse (and that of November 23, 1295 as well) may also be found in the

 anonymous Sultânî zîj (fols. 137r— 138r) for the latitude of Yazd. The computation of the parameters of the

 lunar eclipses of May 9, 1305 and December 14, 1312 (and that of January 4, 1303 as well) can be found
 in the Ashrafizîj (fols. 133v-134r, 145v-146r) for the latitude of Shiraz

 8-9),91 Wâbkanawi mentions the two methods in order to measure the times of the

 phases of an eclipse: (1) the standard method of computing the time from the altitude

 of the sun (in the case of a solar eclipse) or the moon and reference stars (in the case of a

 lunar eclipse) and (2) using the clepsydra. They together, as Wâbkanawi emphasized,

 constituted a method that might reduce the probable errors in measuring time. In

 Table 14, the times of the maximum phases of these 15 lunar total eclipses calculated

 based on these three zîjes were compared with the true modern values. Comparing

 al-Maghribl's times with those given by the Ilkhânî zîj shows that each set have more

 accurate values for about half number of the eclipses; the mean values of errors are

 91 Wâbkanawï, Τ: fols. 92r-v, Y: fols. 159r-160r, P: fols. 139r— 140r. The passage in question may also be

 found in the "Ghâzân's treatise on the observational instruments" (cf. note 20). In it, the time-measuring

 device is, however, called the "time-glass" (shîsha-i sâ'at).

 about +24 and +30min, respectively. WâbkanawT has nine values more accurate

 than the Ïlkhânïzfj, while for the two eclipses (i.e., 1302-01-15 and 1320-07-21), the

 errors of the two zîjes (regardless of sign) are equal. Comparing with Muhyï al-DTn,
 WâbkanawT has 11 more accurate values. In the case of WâbkanawT, the mean value

 of the errors is only —2min. Therefore, it can obviously be seen that Wâbkanawï's

 modification of al-Maghribï's value for the mean longitude of the moon significantly

 resulted in reducing errors by a mean value of 22min. I believe that this statistically

 suggests that his correction of al-Maghribï's value for the lunar mean longitude at

 the epoch was the result of doing observations. The similar conclusion may be drawn

 from the computation of the annular solar eclipse of January 30, 1283. The error in the

 time of the maximum phase of this eclipse as computed by WâbkanawT in his zïj for

 the latitude of Mughân (northwestern Iran, φ % 39°) in comparison with the modern

 data is —4 min while the time computed according to al-Maghribï's parameter values

 (i.e., only neglecting Wâbkanawï's modification of al-Maghribï's value for the lunar

 mean longitude at the epoch) is +28 min.92

 6 Concluding remarks

 In this paper, we presented Muhyï al-Dïn al-Maghribï's determination of the parame

 ters of the Ptolemaic lunar model at the Maragha observatory in the 1270s and 1280s

 based on the contents of books V and VI of his Talkhîs al-majistî. As we already men

 tioned, besides al-Bïrunî ( 11 th et.) and al-Kâshï ( 15th et.), who documented their deter

 minations of the size of the lunar epicycle and the lunar mean motions, al-Maghribï

 is the only Islamic astronomer who gave the account of his determination of all of the

 lunar parameters on the basis of the data obtained from observations. His observations

 and computations were explained in Sect. 3, and some of their distinct features were

 commented upon in Sect. 4. The results were compared with the values preserved from
 other medieval Middle Eastern astronomers (4.7). Al-Maghribï obtained new values

 for the lunar mean motions (3.2), eccentricity (3.3), and parallax (3.6). The value 5; 12

 our author found for the size of the epicycle (3.1) dates, at least, back to the early

 tenth century, and in the case of the inclination of the lunar orbit, he preferred to stay
 with the ancient value 5° (3.5). Our author also tested the Ptolemaic lunar model and

 verified that the distance between the point of prosneusis and the earth's center is equal

 to the eccentricity.

 Muhyï al-Dïn, as the contents of the Talkhîs illustrate, was a well-experienced

 astronomer who knew when and under what conditions he could find what he sought

 after. For example, the lunar observation no. 6 was done when only three years had

 been elapsed after laying of the cornerstone of the observatory while its buildings

 and instruments had not yet been constructed completely; as already discussed (cf.

 Sect. 3.6 and note 50), the specific situation concerning the positions of the moon

 in connection with the ecliptic and the position of the ecliptic with respect to the
 local horizon at the instant of this observation, which satisfied the essential condi

 tions for measuring the lunar parallax, did not occur again at Maragha until nine

 years later.

 We also dealt, as a case study, with Wâbkanawï's attempts for reconciling theory

 and observation as regard the times of the lunar synodic phenomena computed from the

 zïjes of the Maragha tradition. It was concluded that al-Maghribï's parameter values

 resulted in times that agree only a bit better with the true modern values than those

 computed from the Îlkhânîzîj■ But Wâbkanawï's modification of al-Maghribl's value

 for the lunar mean longitude appears to make a remarkable improvement on times

 computed from al-Maghribl's values for the lunar parameters that were determined at

 the Maragha observatory.
