 Abstract This paper analyses a kinematic model for the solar motion by Qutb al

 Din al-ShMzI, a thirteenth-century Iranian astronomer at the Marägha observatory in

 northwestern Iran. The purpose of this model is to account for the continuous decrease

 of the obliquity of the ecliptic and the solar eccentricity since the time of Ptolemy.

 Shlräzl puts forward different versions of the model in his three major cosmographical

 works. In the final version, in his Tuhfa, the mean ecliptic is defined by an eccentric

 of fixed mean eccentricity and a mean obliquity fixed with respect to the celestial
 equator, and the center of the epicycle, which is inclined to the eccentric, moves on

 the eccentric with an annual period. By an additional slow motion of the sun on the

 epicycle, the true eccentricity of the solar deferent, defined by the annual motion of

 the sun, and the sun's extreme declination from the equator change, accounting for the

 reduction of the eccentricity and the obliquity of the ecliptic since the time of Ptolemy.

 1 Introduction

 A medieval astronomer working in the Ptolemaic tradition had the two choices in

 dealing with the differences he could ipso facto find between his own measured para

 meter values and those he inherited from Ptolemy or his close predecessors. As Ν. M.
 Swerdlow puts them:

 [A] The first was to reject all earlier observations until he could first establish a

 fairly accurate representation of the motions of the heavens using only extremely
 accurate observations from his own time. Ancient observations could then be

 measured against this standard to see whether they fit well enough to confirm or

 correct this preliminary theory, or were so far out of line that they could safely
 be eliminated as erroneous.

 [5] The alternative was to trust in the accuracy of his predecessors and develop

 a theory that would, in so far as possible, account for all their observations.1

 During the medieval Islamic period (eighth-sixteenth centuries), these two distinct

 approaches indeed highlight two different kinds of astronomy evolved in two sepa

 rated geographical domains of Islamic realm: the first can be addressed in Eastern

 (Middle Eastern) Islamic astronomy, but the most established steps of the second can

 be associated with Western Islamic astronomy (in Maghrib and Andalus) from the early

 eleventh century onwards, when Ibn al-Zarqälluh made the first attempts at explaining

 the long-term variations in the rate of precession, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and

 the solar eccentricity by inventing a series of historically eminent quantified models.2

 Let us call the first approach or methodology as the "Standard Establishment" and the

 latter as "For-All-Time Astronomy"; or "Short range observational astronomy" and

 "Long term theoretical astronomy", respectively, after Moesgaard.3

 By the astronomical observations in the early Islamic period, new values for the

 obliquity of the ecliptic, the rate of precession, and the solar parameters (eccentricity,

 the longitude of apogee, and the length of solar year) were observed; the first main

 focus of these experimental activities was at Baghdad about 830 AD. At this primary

 stage, a vast amount of attempts made at justifying the fact that the solar apsidal line

 has moved since Ptolemy, and that similar to the planetary apsidal lines, the apogee

 of the sun is subject to the precession and thus sidereally fixed. Another century was

 needed to pass until other non-Ptolemaic values for these parameters were measured,
 and thereafter the medieval Middle Eastern astronomers encountered a prominent

 problem concerning whether these fundamental parameters are in reality constant or
 variable. In his vast discussion on this basic problem in the turn of the past millennium,

 Βϊηΐηϊ, in his al-Qänün al-mas'üdl, put forward the reasons why the method [Λ] above

 should be adopted; his main, and indeed intelligible, reasons were the difficulties with
 the observational activities and the critical sensitivity of the methods by means of

 which the times of occurrence of solstices and equinoxes are estimated, and hence,

 the length of solar year and its orbital elements are determined.4 This work exerted a

 significant influence on the later astronomers in the Middle East, so that the problem

 no longer turned into being a central matter of busy for the later Eastern Islamic

 astronomers. Of the scarce attempts made there for accounting the long-term periodic

 or secular changes in the Ptolemaic constants, only these can be mentioned: a simple

 trepidation model seems to have been available in the Middle East prior to the tenth

 century, in which the variations both in the rate of precession and in the obliquity of

 the ecliptic are accounted for by the rotation of the pole of the ecliptic on a small circle

 of radius 4° around an axis that is fixed with respect to that of the celestial equator.

 The reference point of this model is the summer solstice (Head of Cancer). The purely

 geometrical and qualitative account of this model can be found in the two tenth-century
 Middle Eastern treatises: Ibrahim b. Sinän b. Thäbit b. Qurra's Kitäb harakät al-shams

 and Abü Ja'far al-Khäzin's Zij al-safä'ih.5 This is what the astronomers working at

 the Maragha observatory (northwestern Iran, 1260-c. 1320) like Naslr al-DTn al-TüsT
 (1201-1274) and Qutb al-Dln al-Shrrazi (1236-1311) discussed and discarded in his

 cosmographical works. Or the very curious idea that Ibn al-Amäjür maintained about

 the maximum value of the latitude (the inclination of the orbit) of the moon; as reported

 by Ibn Yünüs,6 Ibn al-Amäjür believed that it is not constant. Of course, no model was

 proposed to account for the variations observed in the inclination of the lunar orbit.

 For the explanation of the variations found in the parameter values derived from the

 observations, which were often minor and irregular, they were reasonably attributed

 to observational errors or deficiencies of applied instruments. Especially, many such

 instances can be addressed in BtrOnl's works, a good number of which have already

 been introduced and classified by Ο. B. Sheynin.7 An example (not considered in those

 papers) is: Getting a precision of about some sixtieths of a day, or higher degrees of

 accuracy, in the length of the solar year is impossible; as BTrünT remarks,8 this is so,

 because the instruments are, in principle, unable to record it thoroughly; with regard

 to the medieval methods of the interpolation in the solar meridian altitude within

 some days about the cardinal positions, i.e. the solstices and equinoxes, to estimate

 their times, in order to reach such a precision, one needs an instrument graduated to,

 e.g. every arc-second. Or Muhyi al-Dln al-Maghribl (d. 1283), who carried out an

 extensive observational programme at Maragha between 1262 and 1274, observed the

 eight brightest stars, then compared his derived latitudes with the surviving ancient
 values, and concluded that "what we found for their latitudes do not differ from the

 values observed by the ancients, no difference to an extent which is countable. The
 [inconsistencies] are due to observations, not owing to [proper] motion".9 Another

 example is al-Shlräzfs treatment of the differences in the values observed for the

 obliquity of the ecliptic from Hipparchus through the early Islamic period to his own

 time, for which he posits the idea, first in the order of priority, that the source, disorder,

 and irregularity of these differences may be due to the difference in the fabrication,

 5 On the trepidation models, a vast, elaborate literature exists, of which the following works are worth
 reading: Comes (1996, 2001), Goldstein (1965, 1994), Hartner (1971), Mancha (1998, 2004), Mercier
 (1976/1977, 1996), North (1967), Samsö (1994b, 1998, pp. 93-96,2001, pp. 169-174), Samsö and Milläs
 (1994), Swerdlow (1975), Swerdlow and Neugebauer (1984, pp. 129-148). On Islamic astronomical tables
 see Kennedy (1956) and Samsö et al. (2001); these two main sources of the knowledge of Islamic astro

 nomical tables, the so-called zijes, are followed by a new comprehensive survey that is currently prepared
 by Benno Van Dalen.

 for this inequality was not worked out until Tycho Brahe; see Swerdlow (2009, esp. pp. 35-40).

 size, graduation, and installation of the applied instruments. By irregularity, he actually

 means that, for example, the difference between Ptolemy's 23;51° and 23;35° as found

 in the observations carried out in the period of al-Ma'mün's reign (the 'Abbäsid caliph

 from 812 to 833) corresponds to a rate of decrease of 1' in 43 Egyptian/Persian years,

 the interval of time between the two being 690 years, whereas BTrünf s value is by 2'

 more than Yahyä b. Abi Mansür's 23;33°.10

 This type of treatment seems principally to have been based upon Ptolemy's refer

 ring to the decisive effect of the discrepancies in the observational instruments,11

 which could evidentially be enhanced by the Islamic astronomers' experiences with

 the difficulties with astronomical instruments, regardless of their sizes or types. For

 example, the Banü Müsä treated a difference of 2° they found between the motion of

 the solar apogee and that of Regulus (a Leo), i.e. precession, in the period between

 Ptolemy's and their time as "com[ing] from observational errors".12 By such consider

 ations, it may be said that a very primitive qualitative theory of errors in astronomical

 affairs had been evolved from Ptolemy's scattered allusions to them in the Almagest

 to an incidental conception and distinction of the random and systematic errors. For

 example, concerning Ptolemy's finding that the solar apogee is fixed by comparing his

 and Hipparchus's observations, TaqI al-DTn Muhamamd b. Ma'rüf (1525-1585), the

 director of the short-lived observatory at Istanbul, states that it may be because of the

 two sorts of the possible errors occurring in observations: the one, errors in making

 observations, and the other, discrepancies of the instruments, "because their situations

 are not investigated by repeating observations".13 That "situation of the instruments"

 should be examined by "repeating observations" seems to refer, though implicitly, to a

 possible source of systematic errors, in the modern sense, since a defected instrument

 may produce such errors.

 Nevertheless, on the contrary, when the same values for the solar parameters and the

 obliquity of the ecliptic arrived at the Western Islamic lands, they gave rise to a different

 10 Shlräzl, Ikhttyärät, f. 26v; Tuhfa, f. 18r; Nihäyat, PI: f. 18r, P2: f. 39r. The al-Ma'münlc observations

 were made by Yahyä b. Abi Mansür (d. 830) at Baghdad and by Khälid b. Abd al-Malik al-Marwarüdl and

 his team at the monastery of Murrän on a hill in the vicinity of Damascus. Shlräzl correctly ascribes the

 value 23;33° to the first and associates 23;35° with the latter. BlrünT is more precise and mentions all the
 values 23;33,52°, 23;33,57°, and 23;34,27° he found in his sources concerning the observational results
 at Damascus from 831 to 833 AD (the true modern value at the time ~23;35,33°). Blrünl's own value is

 23;35° derived from his observations of the extremal solar noon altitudes in the latter part of the 1010s

 (for the analysis of them, see Said and Stephenson 1995, esp. p. 123). As he notices, the majority of the

 early Islamic astronomers observed either exactly this value or the values close to it; e.g. 23;34,51° in
 a table in which the solar noon altitudes observed by Khälid in Damascus were written down; the Banü

 Mflsä at Baghdad (at Sämarrä', they had found 23;34,30°); Sulaymän b. 'Ismat of Samarqand: 23;34,40°

 (according to Βϊτϋηϊ, Sulaymän adjusted the solar noon altitudes at the solstices by the parallax, by which

 he yielded 23;33,42°); al-Battänl in Raqqa (Säbi' zlj, Sect. 4; Nallino [1899-1907] 1969, Vol. 3, p. 18:
 from the repeatedly observations of the solar yearly extremal zenith distances, he found ?mm = 12; 26° and

 kind of astronomy. The simple trepidation model mentioned above was also passed

 from the Middle East into Andalus where the complicated quantitative trepidation
 models were developed from the eleventh century on in order to account for the

 observed decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic (which was thought to be a periodic

 variation). Ibn al-Zarqälluh (d. 1100) is perhaps the most important who accomplished,

 elaborated, and promoted a plan for a long-term theoretical astronomy in Andalus;

 he invented a solar model with a variable eccentricity14 and some trepidation models,

 which appear to have also served as a point of departure for al-B itrüjT to work out his

 planetary homocentric models.15

 By the establishment of the Maragha observatory and gathering a good number of

 scholars and astronomers there, the two independent observational programmes were

 carried out: the one by al-MaghribT and the other by the main staff of the observatory

 under the supervision of al-TüsI. The first achieved a systematic re-measurement of
 the solar, lunar, and planetary orbital elements on the basis of the extensive obser

 vations which al-Maghribl documents in his Talkhis al-majisti, "Compendium of the

 Almagest", but the second was confined to the observations of 16 fixed stars and the

 derivation of a new value for the size of the epicycle of Mars. Rather, the main staff

 of the observatory, notably, Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdl of Damascus and Tüsl, along

 with Shlräzl, turned their attention to a theoretical aspect of astronomy, represented by

 cosmography, the tradition of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, in order to solve the

 philosophical difficulties arising from some components of Ptolemaic models such
 as the small circles responsible for the planetary motions in latitude as well as the

 separation of the centre of heavenly bodies' mean motions, i.e. the equant point, from

 the centre of universe. The purely geometrical models built there, which mainly use al

 Tüsl's geometrical device known today as Tüsi's Couple, along with those constructed

 by Ibn al-Shätir within a century later is known today as the Maragha School, which

 remained the main focus of historians of astronomy throughout the past half-century

 concerning the activities at Maragha.16

 and matured way to the planetary theory, and Copernicus did the same in De Revolutionibus ΙΠ. By the

 Gregory Chioniades, this device was entered into the Byzantine literature which were available in Padua

 recent decades. It deserves noting that although the transmission had most probably occurred in reality (as

 The early Islamic astronomers had raised some questions and kept them open to

 be answered after more observations would be made in a long period to enable future

 generations to find appropriate answers to them.17 At the core of them was the problem

 of secular or periodic changes in the Ptolemaic constants, and optimistically, it was

 expected that further continuous observations could gain new insights for solving them.

 Although the complicated nature of such a problem together with the methodology

 [A], mentioned in the beginning of this paper, established in Middle Eastern astronomy

 through about five centuries and enhanced by other observational programmes after
 BTriM (e.g. by 'Abd al-Rahmän al-Khäzini, c. 1125, and Ibn al-Fahhäd, c. 1175),

 raised a slight chance for a comprehensive programme of this kind. For example,

 despite the values observed for the solar eccentricity during the early Islamic period,

 which show a slow continuous decrease in its size, al-Khäzini derived a greater, and

 in fact more erroneous, value and Ibn al-Fahhäd arrived at the same value that Yahyä

 b. Abl Mansur had measured almost three centuries and a half earlier.18 The only

 parameters that clearly illustrate the probability of any change or variation in Ptolemaic

 constants with the passage of time were the rate of precession and the obliquity of the

 ecliptic.

 By means of his systematic stellar observations at Maragha, Muhyi al-DIn deduced

 that the precession consists only in a uniform, continuous motion, with the rate of 1°

 in every 66 years, which is faster than the value 1 °/72y he had derived from his obser

 vations at Damascus and adopted it in his earlier work, the Täj al-azyäj.19 His value

 for the rate of precession and his belief in the continuous uniform precession in the Täj

 al-azyäj stood against the theory of trepidation received in Western Islamic astronomy.

 Some astronomers that worked in the Maghrib in the fifteenth century on cast doubts on

 the truth of trepidation theory. In this aspect, the Täj al-azyäj exerted some influences

 on these astronomers, because the steady uniform precessional motion posited in this

 work with the rate of l°/72y would lead to a good agreement with the observations

 carried out there from the twelfth century on.20 Muhyi al-DTn's contemporaries and

 colleagues at the Maragha observatory such as Tüsl and Shlräzl accepted the constant

 rate l°/70y for the precession that their near predecessors (notably, Ibn al-A'lam and
 Ibn Yünus) found21; Shlräzl also adds that this value is used at our time, since it too is

 in accordance with the "new observations", namely those made at the Maragha obser

 Footnote 16 continued

 Swerdlow 1973, p. 504), nevertheless the question is still "when, where, and in what form he learned of

 Maragha theory" (Swerdlow and Neugebauer 1984, pp. 41-48).

 17 E.g. BTrunfs statement concerning the solar apogee motion in al-Qänün VI.8: 1954-1956, Vol. 2, p.

 685; translated in Hartner and Schramm (1961, p. 218).

 18 See Mozaffari (2013a, Part 1: p. 326 (Table 3, nos. 7 and 8), 330, Part 2: pp. 393,394-395).

 19 This is the best medieval approximation to the true rate \°/Ί\.Θ and also can be found in the Barcelona
 Tables (written c. 1381); see Dorce (2002-2003, p. 198); 2003, pp. Ill, 180. It was also independently
 measured in Italy or France in 1306, as documented in a codex preserved in Vienna, no. 5311, f. 137r; see

 Goldstein (1994, pp. 193,196-197); also, for the star tables in this manuscript, see Kunitzsch (1986).

 vatory.22 The two values l°/66y and l°/70y were known in the early Islamic period,
 and the Muslim astronomers sometimes reached the first and sometimes arrived at the

 latter, but apparently never wholly considered why the first value is deduced whenever

 their observed longitudes are compared with Ptolemy's or Menelaus' imaginary star

 catalogue (i.e. Ptolemaic longitudes minus 0;25°), while the latter values is derived

 whenever their longitude values are compared either with their Islamic predecessors

 or with those of the ancient astronomers, like Hipparchus and Timocharis as recorded

 in Almagest VII.2-3. Instead, the problem became whether the speed of the precession

 has really changed since Ptolemy (l°/100y) through the early Islamic period (l°/6G/)

 and then to the time of the turn of the eleventh century (Ibn al-A 'lam, Ibn Yünus, and
 BTrum: ~l°/70y).

 Also, from the extremal values observed for the solar noon/meridian altitude at

 Maragha in 1264, which were 76;9,30° and 29;9,30°, Muhyl al-DIn measured a value

 of 23;30° for the obliquity of the ecliptic.23 This value is used in the other two zijes

 of the Maragha tradition, i.e. the Ilkhäm zij and WabkanawT's Muhaqqa zij, as well

 as in al-Käshf s Zij.24 However, in the Ilkhäm zij, al-TüsT remarks that "on the basis

 of our observations, the obliquity of the ecliptic exceeds 23;30° by a small amount

 and we estimated it to be 23;30°".25 This as compared with Ptolemy's 23;51° and the

 values in the range from 23;33° to 23;35° repeatedly measured by the earlier Islamic

 astronomers conspicuously exhibit the permanent decrease in the maximum angular

 distance of the ecliptic from the celestial equator.

 These two problems found some echoes in the Maragha cosmographical works:

 Tüsl's Tadhkirajx 'ilm al-hay'a ("Memoir on the cosmography") and Shlrazi's three

 major treatise, Ikhtiyärät-i muzaffari ("Selections by Muzaffar al-DIn"; dedicated to

 Muzaffar al-DIn Buläq Arsalän, d. 1305, a local ruler), Tuhfa al-shähiyyafi Ί-hay'a

 ("Gift to the king on astronomy"), and Nihäyat al-idräkfi diräyat al-afläk ("Limit of

 Comprehension in the knowledge of celestial heavens").26

 The variation in the rate of precession is mentioned in these works in connection

 with the variation of the obliquity, and both of them are initially considered in relation

 to the simple trepidation model of the Eastern Islamic astronomy. Tüsl and ShirazT's

 works give some strong impression that no one at the time could be sure of the truth of

 whether such secular or periodic variation in reality exists in the precession or in the

 IBr, 20r, P2: ff. 39v, 43v. In his earlier wok, Mu'miyya (IV.6, p. 30), Tüsi does not mention this value, and

 only refers to "l°/100y found in the time of Ptolemy and Menelaus and l°/66y observed by the moderns".

 Mozaffari 2014). Muhyi al-DTn had already reached this figure through his observations carried out at

 obliquity.27 None of them extend their speculations to the variation in the precessional

 motion, but the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic appears more evident to them,

 since both Tüsl and ShiräzT consider more seriously the apparent decrease in the

 obliquity of the ecliptic since Ptolemy's time as indicated by the observations made

 by their early Islamic predecessors and their own. It was this that paved the way for

 the simple trepidation model having been posited, of course, solely as a provisional
 solution which was soon discarded.28

 Tusl's final solution is the employment of his own method (wajh) or, properly speak

 ing, the spherical version of the so-called Tüsl's Couple.29 Nevertheless, it appears

 to have been employed as a merely hypothetical consideration to highlight the power

 of his geometrical device for providing theoretical explanations for more problems at

 issue in astronomy of his time. In other words, he appears to consider the apparent

 permanent decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic and the variation of the rate of
 precession as typical hypothetical problems for which his geometrical device could

 readily provide a physically justified mechanism to account.

 ShiräzT rejects the variation in the speed of precession, but appears to show some

 doubt about the change in the obliquity, and that the decrease in its observed values may

 in reality be because of the closeness of the ecliptic to the equator.30 He then proceeds

 to explain the simple theory of trepidation accounting for the changes both in the speed

 of precession and in the obliquity in more details than TüsT. His other solution is, of

 course, the use of the spherical version of Tüsl's Couple, which he specifically calls

 the "model/hypothesis for the declination/obliquity" (asl al-mayl), in order to account

 for the variation in the obliquity.31 Meanwhile, he proposes a third alternative: as he

 puts it, if the value of the motion of the obliquity of the ecliptic is known precisely, then

 the simplest/nearest method (aqrab wajh) for the conception (tasawwur) of its mover

 (muharrik) and model (hay'a) is that the solar model should be an eccentric-epicyclic

 one. This model makes the decrease in the obliquity intrinsically pertinent to that of

 the solar eccentricity.

 This forgotten solar model appears interesting in some aspects; more notably, this

 is the only attempt we know from the medieval Middle Eastern astronomy to take

 into account the secular changes in Ptolemaic astronomy more seriously than had

 previously been considered. This model, which has hitherto remained unnoticed in

 the modern literature, is the main subject of the present paper.

 This solar model is explained in all of ShTräzI's three major treatises mentioned

 above, but, unfortunately, in none of them does he provide a figure, in the absence
 of which, it is difficult to reconstruct the model. In what follows, we summarize and

 27 Al-Tüsi (1993, pp. 222-223) says that his method (i.e. Tüsrs Couple) can be applied to accounting for

 the variation in the speed of the precession or in the obliquity if the truth of these two motions and their

 variability is ascertained. A similar remark is given by Shlrazi prior to the explanation of his solar model.

 28 Al-Tüsi (1993, pp. 125); Shlrazi explains this trepidation theory in a confused way in Ikhtiyärät II.4: ff.

 classify ShlräzT's remarks in Sect. 2 and then present our reconstruction of this model
 on the basis of his account in Sect. 3.32 Before beginning the explanation, let us first

 say something of ShlräzT's contribution to astronomy and then clarify a frequently
 used technical term that the whole of his solar model is to account for its variation,

 i.e. mayl.

 In two studies in 1979, Saliba shows that al-ShträzT's planetary model that became

 known through Kennedy's (1966) study is due to his elder colleague and contemporary,

 al-'UrdT.33 One year later, Saliba referred to ShTräzT's criticisms of a simple concentric

 epicycle model worked out by Abu 'Ubayd al-Jüzjänl (d. 1070), Avicenna's famous

 student.34 A decade later, he reasonably argued that ShlräzT's most ingenious models

 are for the moon and Mercury35; of course, he believed over two decades ago that

 "further studies may very well change the picture we now have of ShTräzT's contribution

 to the Maragha studies". To the best of our knowledge, no further and deeper study

 has yet be accomplished to reject or conversely establish ShTräzT's importance in this

 aspect, while the present study reveals another model of his own that seems ingenious,

 original, and unprecedented.

 The study of ShlräzT's astronomy has difficulties of its own: let us quote the late

 Kennedy and Saliba that when describing ShTräzT's planetary models, each folio is

 exasperating by itself, the reason being, as the latter explains,36 that ShTräzT put for

 wards parallel models or different variants of a model side-by-side, posits and discuss

 the faults and discrepancies or some aspects of a part of them, and leaves the remain

 der to his readers to discover or decide; an exceptional attitude we shall presently

 encounter, too, in the account of his solar model. The other problem is that ShTräzT,

 similar to many medieval scholars, does not identify his sources adequately: besides

 ShlräzT's adoption of al-'UrdT's models, he adopts al-'UrdT's planetary order, accord

 ing to which Venus is located above the sun in the geocentric view,37 without any

 33 Saliba [ 1979aand 1979b] 1994, pp. 114,119—134. Saliba (1987) also demonstrates theclose dependence
 of ShiräzTs discussion on the height of the atmosphere on that of 'Urdl. Also, it is noteworthy that in his non

 astronomical writings, Qutb al-DIn shows a heavy dependence on his Islamic predecessors, often without

 acknowledging them; e.g. in the case of his well-known encyclopaedia, Durrat al-Täj, see Pouijavady and

 Schmidtke (2004), in which the authors go farther to conclude that "the fact that, with the exception of

 portions of the section on logic, no part of the philosophical sections of Durrat al-täj was originally written

 by Qutb al-DTn al-Sh&äzI, suggests that his significance as a philosopher should be reconsidered" (ibid,

 p. 320). It is noteworthy that the mathematical part (first section of jumla 4) of Durrat al-täj seems to be

 a Persian translation of Muhyl al-DIn's al-Maghribrs Tahrlr al-Usül (ibid, p. 313), although this needs to

 be checked further. The astronomical part (second section of jumla 4) of Durrat al-täj is also a translation
 of 'Abd al-Malik b. Muhammad al-Shiräzi's (d. ca. 596 H/1200 AD) Talkhis al-majisti, as Qutb al-DIn

 himself states. About Qutb al-DIn's intellectual background and the manuscripts written by his own hand,
 see Pourjavady and Schmidtke (2007, 2009).

 37 Al-'Urdi made a drastic change in Ptolemy's order of the planets by placing Venus above the sun. He

 reasonably assumes the values which Ptolemy quotes from Hipparchus for the apparent radii of the plan
 ets at their mean distances should have been measured at their least distances, and as well, he takes the

 actual radii of the bodies of the sun, moon, and planets and the thickness of the sphere of lunar nodes

 into account in the computation of their distances. The latter consideration is indeed an improvement over

 mention of the latter's name, after he presents a densely argumentative comparative
 discussion of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses and Küshyär b. Labbän's (tenth cen

 tury) method for the measurement of the sizes and distances38 accompanied with
 his critical remarks.39 It is noteworthy that al-'Urdl's treatise on the sizes and dis

 tances was written before his joining the Maragha observatory, and hence, it is not

 known whether he withdrew his opinion of putting Venus above the sun after col

 laborating with TüsT and learning of the suspect observations of the Venus transit

 documented in his TahrTr al-majisti.40 But it is curious that Shlräzl poses again the

 Footnote 37 continued

 Ptolemy's procedure on the basis of which al- 'UrdI derives the boundaries of the lunar spheres, i.e. the limits
 of the convex and concave surfaces of its spheres as equal, respectively, to (maximum distance + radius
 of the moon + thickness of its sphere of nodes) = 64;10+0;17,33 + 0;2,27=64;30 and (minimum dis
 tance—radius of the moon)=33;33 — 0;17,33 = 33;15,27 terrestrial radii. Then, from the Ptolemaic value

 of 64;10t r· for the moon's greatest distance, together with committing an error in the calculation of Mer

 cury's least distance (wrongly assumed equal to radius of the deferent - 3 · eccentricity - radius of the

 epicycle), he finds that the space between Mercury and Sun is not large enough to accommodate Venus,

 which was persuasive for him to place Venus above the sun. Consequently, this made the radius of the
 universe enlarge to 140115tr\ i.e. about 7 times as large as Ptolemy's (cf. Goldstein and Swerdlow 1970).

 Al-'UrdT's schemata was not accepted by the later astronomers, except for Shlräzl, but taking the thickness

 of the sphere of the lunar node into consideration found echoes in the later treatises; e.g. in Käshf s Sullam

 al-samä' (the stairway to the heaven), ff. 7r and lOr where the thickness is computed as 3;28,47t r.

 40 Four Islamic reports of the Venus transit in the period of 800-1200 AD are discussed in Goldstein (1969);

 another report belonging to 939 AD came to light in Vaquero and Gallego (2002). As a comment upon
 Almagest IX. 1, in his Tahrir al-majisfi(PI: pp. 282-283, P2: f. 82v, P3: f. 107v), al-TusI mentions that a

 certain Sälih b. Muhammad al-Zaynabl al-Baghdädl reports in his book named Majispthe two observations
 of the transit of Venus made by al-Shaykh Abä 'Imrän at Baghdad and Muhammad b. AbT Bakr al-Haklm in

 Farsin in the vicinity of TQlak (all the three men are otherwise unknown); the interval of time between them

 was 20 years, and, in one of them, Venus was at the apogee of the epicycle (i.e. in superior conjunction)

 while in the other, at its perigee (i.e. in inferior conjunction). Al-Tüsl makes use of these reports to invalidate

 the idea that the two inferior planets are in the sphere of the sun as well as that the centre of their epicycles

 coincide with the centre of the sun's body, that is, that they rotate about the sun (for the translation of the

 passage in question, see Saliba [1987] 1994, p. 149). It is not known precisely whether each of the two

 mentioned astronomers had observed only one of the two presumed transits of Venus, or both of them had

 observed both of the two transits. In any case, one of the two observations is certainly incorrect simply

 because none of the inferior planets can transit across the solar disc in a superior conjunction, and thus,

 such an observation should at best be related to a large sunspot. Al-Tüsl mentions them after referring to

 Ibn SInä (Avicenna's) famous observation of the Venus transit, by means of which the time frame of them

 can be delimited: they should have been made somewhere between ca. 1032 (the only Venus transit that

 occurred during the lifetime of Ibn SInä) and 5 Shawwäl 644/13 February 1247 when al-TüsI completed
 his Tahrir al-majisti (Saliba [1987] 1994, p. 145). In this period, the only two Venus transits took place
 on 22 May 1040 and 23 November 1153 (Espenak, NASA's Six Millennium Catalog of Venus Transits).

 Another note is that in the case of Venus, 5 revolution of the anomaly occurs in 8 years; so, it is a very

 simple matter to contend that if Venus is at the apogee of its epicycle at a given time, then 20 years later,

 i.e. after the two revolutions and a half through the epicyclic anomaly, it would be located at the perigee of

 its epicycle. Nevertheless, the consideration of the validity of the Venus transits for a medieval astronomer
 (as well as a modern historian of astronomy) requires a deeper scrutiny of an inferior planet's motion in

 longitude as well as in latitude. If al-TüsI or al-ShiräzI had made such a quantitative study, then it could have

 been known that even in the framework of Ptolemaic planetary models, and by means of applying his own

 parameter values, Venus transits can occur in the intervals of 105.5 or 129 years, not in periods of 20 years
 (cf. Neugebauer 1975, Vol. 1, pp. 227-229). Ptolemy himself describes qualitatively the circumstances
 involved in the observations of the transit of an inferior planet across the solar disc in Planetary Hypotheses

 same order of the planets some time after al-TüsT and made some efforts to justify

 and defend the idea by rejecting his Muslim predecessors' observational reports of

 the Venus transit and, instead, considering them, amazingly, as the observations of

 "a tiny black spot existing above the centre of the solar disc, as some people hav

 ing a keen eyesight recognize it",41 presumably without worrying about violating
 the Aristotelian dogma of the heavens devoid of Generation and Corruption. It also

 seems strange that at the beginning of his account of al-'Urdl's schemata, Shlräzi

 severely criticizes Ptolemy's procedure of computing the heavenly distances in the

 Planetary Hypotheses, at the first step of which Ptolemy rounds the least and great
 est distances of the moon from the earth, 33;33 and 64;10 terrestrial radii, to 33 and

 64.42 Shlräzi believes that Ptolemy has deliberately dropped the fractions and said

 that there is a reason for it, while no reason in doing so is acceptable, but Shlräzi

 himself never realized that the whole of al-'Urdl's idea that Venus is put above the

 sun stems from a miscomputation of Mercury's minimum distance (see, above, note
 37).

 In his Nihäyat II.8,43 Shlräzi attempts to give an observational proof that in the

 case of the three outer planets, the centre of the geocentric orbit, the deferent, on

 the circumference of which the epicycle centre revolves, should be located between

 the equant, the centre of the uniform motion in longitude, and the earth, since on

 the basis of it, the difference in size of the arcs of the retrograde motions of the

 planets can be accounted for.44 It appears somewhat strange that an astronomer at

 once, on the one hand, makes attempts at constructing the alternative models to

 eliminate the physical/philosophical difficulties with the equant point in Ptolemaic

 models45 by superimposing it on complicated systems of "cycle on epicycle, orb

 on orb"46 and, on the other hand, incidentally, admits its validity in an observa

 tional aspect. Moreover, Shlräzl's proof is indeed circular, simply because the first

 step in his derivation of the deferent eccentricity of the outer planets from their ret

 rograde arcs consists in the use of the Apollonius's theorem for the determination

 of their stationary points; according to it, one needs to calculate the true angular

 Footnote 40 continued

 I: (1) the centre of the epicycle at one of the nodes and (2) the planet at that node (i.e. the longitude of that

 node equal to the true longitude of the planet), i.e. the planet at the (true) apogee or perigee of its epicycle.

 He also notes that a long time must elapse between the two successive returns of the centre of the epicycle
 and the planet in conjunction with the sun (Goldstein 1967, pp. 6-7,28).

 sunspots are also short-lived phenomena, and then it seems strange to maintain the existence of such an

 appearance for a long time; around ShirazT's time, there are the four reports of the observations of the large

 sunspots from the East Asian history dating to 15-16 September 1258,17 February and 17 March-15 April

 1276, and 31 August 1278, in which the sunspots are described as the "black spots as large as hen/goose's

 eggs"; see Clark and Stephenson (1978, p. 396), Yau and Stephenson (Yau and Stephenson 1988, p. 187).

 velocity of a planet on the epicycle and that of its epicycle centre, none of which

 can, of course, be determined prior to an early derivation of the eccentricity of the
 equant.47

 It is curious that his elder contemporary and colleague at Maragha, MuhyT al-DTn
 al-Maghribl, in his TalkhTs VII.4, makes similar remarks: that the centre of the defer

 ent spheres carrying the epicycles of the four planets, that is, except for Mercury, is

 midway between the centres of the universe and the equant [circle] provides that the

 various observed motions of the planets agree truly with the hypothesis/model (asl)

 established for their motions [i.e. epicycle-eccentric]. He then adds that "Ptolemy

 knew it by means of the artifice (hiylat) rather than by means of proof, [but] we

 offer a proof for it later, God Willing".48 The preserved incomplete manuscript

 of TalkhTs does not contain any such proof, and Ptolemy's iterative procedure is

 strictly applied to the computation of the eccentricities of the three superior plan
 ets. Nevertheless, since one of the missing two last books of the treatise is on the

 retrograde motions and latitudes of the planets, it is tempting to speculate that the

 proof (if in reality, it would have been included in the treatise) might have had

 something to do with the variation of the sizes of the arcs of retrograde motion

 of the planets, where the bisection of the eccentricity appears to account for their

 different sizes. This treatise appears to have been written after Muhyl al-DIn com

 pleted his last zTj, the Adwär al-anwär, at Maragha about the end of 1276, although

 some parts of it, including, especially, his extensive observations (spreading over

 one decade, from 1262 to 1274), the calculations embedded in it, and the parameter

 values derived from them, adopted in the Adwär, should certainly have been pre

 pared at a time preceding the appearance of this work 49 Due to the corruption of

 the only surviving MS. of the TalkhTs, we cannot, unfortunately, compare the two

 proofs given for Ptolemy's bisecting the equant eccentricity and examine whether

 Shiräzl borrowed his proof from his elder contemporary without acknowledging
 him.

 The term mayl is, indeed, a multi-purpose one in Islamic astronomy that was used

 for:

 (a) the declination of the sun (for the planets and stars, a less specified term bu 'd,

 "distance", or bu'd al-khaf'i, "hidden distance" was usually in use),50

 (b) the obliquity of the ecliptic (often more specialized as mayl al-kullT, "total decli

 nation", ghäyat al-mayl, "extremal declination", etc.), or

 (c) naming either the inclination (έγκλισιζ) of the planets' deferents to the ecliptic

 well as for the inclination (according to the majority of Islamic zijes, the "second")

 component of the latitude of the inferior planets.51

 2 Description of the model

 In what follows, a comprehensive account of the solar model as found in all of ShMzFs

 three works is presented. In doing so, we strictly follow the order in which our author

 explains his model. His remarks are numbered for the convenience of referring to them
 in our reconstruction in the next section, and the variations in his account are marked

 with regard to the relevant treatises in order to distinguish the differences between
 them.

 [1] The period at which the sun completes one revolution through the epicycle is

 equal to the period of [the variation in] the obliquity [of the ecliptic] from its
 maximum to minimum and then to maximum.

 [2] Its [i.e., the epicycle's] equator (mintaqa, lit. "belt")52 is inclined to the
 path/trajectory (madär) of its [i.e., the sun's] epicycle centre by the maxi

 mum excess or deficit of the obliquity [of the ecliptic from its mean value],

 [3a] [In the Nihäyat and Tuhfa:] The path of the centre of the epicycle actually

 [3b] [In the Ikhtiyärät:] The path of the centre of the epicycle lies in the plane of

 describes the ecliptic.

 the ecliptic.

 [4] [Only in the Tuhfa:] Or, its [i.e., the epicycle's] equator/belt is perpendicular

 to the path/trajectory of the centre [of the epicycle], so that the diameter of the

 path of the centre of the sun's body through the epicycle from the north to the

 south and vice versa becomes equal to the sum of the chords of the arcs of the

 [maximum] excess and deficit [of the obliquity of the ecliptic from its mean
 value],

 [5] Thus, the sun becomes closer to or further from the path of the epicycle centre,

 and so the ecliptic (since the path of the centre of the epicycle lies in the plane

 of the ecliptic), by the amount of the inclination (mayl) of the equator/belt of
 the epicycle.

 [6] Therefore, the sun becomes closer to or further from the celestial equator, and

 the obliquity increases or decreases, because the sun is not always moving in
 the plane of the ecliptic, but is inclined to it in either of the two directions

 51 Almagest X1II.3: Toomer (1998, pp. 601-602). This equivalence is according to Hunayn-Thäbit's trans

 lation which constituted the standards in the Arabic astronomical terminology: Arabic Almagest, S: ff.

 212v-213r, PN: ff. 162r-v. For the components of Ptolemy's planetary latitude models in the Almagest, see
 Pedersen (1974, pp. 358-359,369-370), where έγκλισιζ is rendered into "deviation"; Neugebauer (1975,
 Vol. 1, pp. 209,214), Swerdlow (2005, pp. 51-52).

 52 Since our author deals with these matters from a cosmographical (hay'a) point of view (as in

 Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses), the orbital components such as epicycle and eccentric are always treated
 as spheres/orbs. Accordingly, instead of simply using epicycle or eccentric as the geometrical instru

 ments/devices (as in the Almagest) in order to describe the compound motions of a heavenly object, he

 indicates this by referring to the equator/belt of the epicycle or eccentric spheres, that is, the great circle 90°
 distant from the poles of these spheres. In order not to confuse it with the celestial equator, we add "belt"
 immediately after "equator" in these cases.

 [i.e., towards north or south], except for when it is located in the two points

 intersecting the equators of its epicycle and eccentric;

 [7] [In this situation], the [eccentric] circle that the centre of the sun's body

 describes is equal to the equator/belt of the eccentric; in other situations: if the

 sun is at the apogee of the epicycle or in vicinity of it, the circle that the centre

 of the sun's body describes is greater than the equator of the eccentric, and if

 the sun is at the perigee of the epicycle or in its neighborhood, the circle that

 the centre of the sun's body describes is less than the equator of the eccentric.

 [8] From this, it necessitates that the amount of eccentricity varies, because it is

 a constant thing (Persian: yik az, Arabic: shay' wähid) that is once taken in

 proportion to a greater value and at another time, to a lesser value. In Ptolemy's

 time, the sun was at the perigee of the epicycle, and for this reason, his value

 for the eccentricity is larger than what is derived from the observations of the
 moderns.

 [9a] [In the Nihäyät and Ikhdyärät:] if we put the ecliptic in the plane of the path

 of the sun's body, then although this necessitates that the sun would always

 be/move in the plane of the ecliptic, it also necessitates that the equator/belt of

 the eight sphere is not always in the plane of the ecliptic, because the situation

 of the ecliptic changes while the situation of the equator/belt of the eight

 sphere does not, because there is no mover to move the equator/belt of the

 eight sphere in latitude.

 [9b] [In the Nihäyat:] We prefer the second, because the observations indicting

 that the sun moves in the plane of the ecliptic is more correct and closer to the

 truth than the observations denoting that the equator/belt of the eight sphere

 lies in the plane of the ecliptic. This is revealed to whoever uses the book of

 the Almagest and investigates the observations mentioned in it.

 [9c] First, if we put the ecliptic in the plane of the path of the centre of the sun's body,

 then the sun would still move in the plane of the ecliptic, but this necessitates

 that the ecliptic does not become a great circle, since the centre of the sun's

 body describes the circles parallel to that described by the centre of the epicycle

 that passes through the centre of the cosmos, and thus since they do not pass

 through it, they are not the great circles. Second, this also necessitates that the

 celestial equator does not lie in the midway/midpoint of the arc that is between

 the greatest [noon/meridian] altitude of the sun towards the north and its least

 altitude [noon/meridian] towards the south. Therefore, it is not only the most

 preferable, but also essential to make/put the circle described by the centre of

 the epicycle as the ecliptic, not that described by the centre of the sun's body.

 3 Reconstruction of the model

 The model consists of an inclined epicycle, the small circles with diameter ab in

 Fig. 1, the centre of which rotates on an eccentric, the circle of diameter C\C2. The sun

 rotates through the epicycle very slowly; the period of its rotation, as stated in [ l],53 is

 equal to the period of the variation in the obliquity of the ecliptic. On the basis of the

 quantities ShlräzT refers to, the bounds/limits of the obliquity are not greater than 24°
 and not yet reaching a value less than 23;30° according to the observations carried out

 at Maragha in Shlräzl's time. By comparing the value 23;35° obtained in al-Ma'münic
 observational programme at Baghdad/Damascus about 830 AD and Ptolemaic value
 23;51° in the 690 Egyptian/Persian years intervening between the two, ShlräzT finds
 the approximate rate 1' in every 43 E/P years. These are the only parameter values
 ShlräzT mentions in connection with this solar model. It is, of course, not known why

 he did not compare Ptolemy's value with the value 23;30° derived from the Maragha
 observations, which also constitutes his lower limit; by taking it into consideration, he

 could find a longer time interval, which is one of the Ptolemaic norms for establishing

 the rates of motions, and thus could arrive at a more precise value for the rate of the

 decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic (about 1' in each 53 years).54

 By the solar motion through the epicycle, it also departs from the ecliptic or
 approaches towards it [5], and hence, its vertical angular distance from the celestial
 equator, the highlighted circle of diameter PQ in Fig. 1, varies as well [6].

 The angle acT of the inclination of the epicycle from the eccentric C\C2, we are told

 in [2], is equal to the amplitude of the variation in the obliquity of the ecliptic (angle aTc
 and angle bTc) from its mean value (angle cTP=angle cTQ)\ this, of course, cannot
 be the case, simply because the inclination can be derived only from the amplitude
 of the variation in the ecliptic and two of the lengths 7c, 7a, and the radius ac of the

 epicycle. Our author seemingly recognize this difficulty and later in the Tuhfa [4],
 says that the epicycle is perpendicular to the path of its centre; in this case, the size
 of the epicycle can be calculated from the amplitude of the variation of the obliquity

 in terms of the arbitrary units assigned to either the length of Tc or of Ta. In addition,

 since the amplitude of the variation in the obliquity towards the north and south of

 Yazdigird, and the interval between it and Yahyä b. Abi Mansür's observations (200 Y) is about 433 E/P
 years. This added to Shlräzl's value 690 years between the latter and Ptolemy yields 1123 years; thus,

 the path of the epicycle centre appear to be equal, it is necessary for the epicycle to
 be perpendicular, namely to have an inclination of 90°, to c\ci- But, this introduces

 a difficulty in the interpretation of [8] where it is said that the solar deferent, i.e. the

 circle described by the trajectory of the centre of its body, is greater when the sun is

 located in the epicyclic perigee than when it is at the epicyclic apogee, while with a

 vertical epicycle, these two temporary deferents would be equal in size (In general,

 for every two points occupied by the sun on its epicycle that are symmetrical with

 respect to the diameter of the epicycle that is perpendicular to acb, the two deferents

 marked by the path of the centre of the solar body have equal diameters.). It is then

 clear that the passage [8] is only consistent with an acute angle for the inclination of

 the epicycle.

 In Shlräzl's accounts in all of his three works, how the model behaves is not suf

 ficiently explained. Since the model is to account for the variation in the obliquity,

 and the inclination of the epicycle is taken as fixed [2], it should safely be assumed

 that the epicycle keeps its positions fixed at all times; namely its surface at various

 positions on the eccentric C\C2 remains parallel to itself, and therefore, the model basi

 cally resembles Ptolemy's model for the latitude of the superior planets in the Handy

 Tables and Planetary Hypotheses, in both of which the inclination of the epicycle is

 fixed, although inclined to the ecliptic in the Handy Tables and parallel to the ecliptic

 in the Planetary Hypotheses. Also, it can be understood from [7] that when the sun is

 located at the epicyclic perigee a, the eccentric described by the centre of its body has

 the least diameter (a\a2), and, on the contrary, when the sun is at the epicyclic apogee

 b, the eccentric so described reaches its largest size (£»1^2)· In [8], the minimum size

 of the eccentric deferent is associated with about Ptolemy's time when the obliquity

 was close to its maximum value and, on the contrary, the maximum diameter of the

 deferent should naturally pertain to the minimum limit observed for the obliquity at

 Shlräzl's time. To put these together straightforwardly leads to the model illustrated

 in Fig. 1, which appears to be the most reasonable reconstruction of what our author
 had in mind.

 The circle c\ci is simply called the path of the centre of the epicycle, the role of

 which in the model is multifold: it lies in the plane of the ecliptic, as said in [3b], or

 the ecliptic itself is formed by it, as remarked in [3a]. It also defines the solar eccentric

 deferent when the sun is located at either of the points intersecting it and the epicycle;

 in this way, it can be taken as the representative of a mean eccentric. The trajectories

 of the centre of the solar body are the temporary eccentrics, continuously connected

 with one another to form a perplexing spiral path through which the sun moves around
 the earth.

 The difficulties arise from the passage [9a] in which ShlräzT exhibits his suspicion

 about the above-mentioned underlying assumptions of the model. From the remarks in

 [9a], the two versions of this model arise. Despite his initial statements in [3], our author

 appears now undecided about which does define, or lie in the plane of, the ecliptic: the

 path of the centre of the solar epicycle or the path of the centre of the solar body. In

 both the Nihäyat and Ikhtiyärät, he considers these two versions as equivalent and so

 leaves the matter to his reader to choose which of the two is preferable; however, in the

 Nihäyat, he adds the passage [9b] which clearly contradicts all of his earlier statements

 in [3] and [9a]: that the path of the centre of the solar body determines the ecliptic, the

 Fig. 2 a δ is the solar annual greatest declination at the perigee of the epicycle and δ', at the apogee of
 the epicycle. Subscript S denotes the summer and W the winter. In this model, the solar yearly maximum

 obliquity of which varies, and so the circle of diameter C\C2 is simply taken as laying in

 the plane of the equator/belt of the eight sphere (besides being the sun's mean eccentric
 and the mean ecliptic as well), which is permanently stable and unmoving, because,
 from a physical point of view, there is no mover to move it. But, by his additional
 statements in the Tuhfa [9c], he refrains from this second version and returns to his

 primary assumption in [3]: that the trajectory of the centre of the solar epicycle defines

 or lies in the plane of the ecliptic, and thus, this is no longer the obliquity of the ecliptic

 that varies, but the sun is implicitly given a slight latitude which smoothly and very
 slowly changes, and, as a result, the solar maximum declination varies, while the

 ecliptic is fixed in the surface C\C2■ Nevertheless, greater difficulties of the other sort

 still arise from the two reasons ShTräzI posits in [9c] for his change of mind in favour
 of a fixed ecliptic. As we have shown earlier, in order to enable the model to account

 for the variation either in the maximum declination of the sun or in the obliquity of the

 ecliptic, the epicycle should remain fixed everywhere on the mean eccentric, because,

 as shown simply from a lateral view in Fig. 2a, only by this can the symmetrical,
 continuous change in the declination of the sun during a solar year between the two
 equal limits (one positive, i.e. towards the north pole, and another negative, i.e. towards

 the south pole) be maintained, and consequently, the altitude of the highest point of the
 celestial equator in a given horizon (i.e. the co-latitude of a location) would be equal
 to the arithmetic mean of the sun's yearly greatest and least meridian/noon altitudes,

 which take place around the summer and winter solstices, respectively. In this model,
 the path of the centre of the sun's body, e.g. the circles with diameters a\a.2 and b\bi

 do not in principle belong to the same sphere, and therefore, one cannot speak of them

 as being the great or small circles on the surface of the celestial sphere, in spite of

 what Shlräzl posits as his first reason in [9c], This reason can, at first sight, be the case

 only if we assume that the epicycle does not keep its position fixed with respect to the

 path of the epicycle centre. This is shown in Fig. 2b: the trajectories a\a2 and b\b2

 of the centre of the sun's body are parallel to the path c\ci of the centre of the sun's

 epicycle. Accordingly, if the ecliptic is identical to the circle described by the path of

 the centre of the solar body, the ecliptic would no longer cross the equator at Τ, the

 earth's centre, and thus, the sun's yearly maximum northern declination would not be

 equal to its maximum southern declination, and therefore, the celestial equator would

 not lie midway between the greatest solar meridian altitude towards the north from
 the horizon and its least meridian altitude towards the south. Shlräzl seems to have

 totally lost the main purpose of the model, because, regardless of which of the two

 paths marks the ecliptic, the model as illustrated in Fig. 2b can in no way maintain

 the symmetry of the annual increase-and-decrease in the solar declination. This gives

 an impression of ShlräzT's confusion with this model, which we have already seen in

 his positing different variants of the model and freely passing from one assumption,

 premise, or consequence to another, without presenting a schematic view of the model

 and adequately setting out the necessary premises and logical sequences leading to

 some of the statements in all of his three major treatises.

 At any rate, if (a) we put ShMzT's hesitation in [9a] aside, (b) neglect his reasons in

 [9c] which, although correct, indicate a variant of the model, by means of which neither

 the long-term variation in the obliquity of the ecliptic nor in the maximum declination

 of the sun can be accounted for, and (c) accept the general stemma deduced and drawn

 by K. Niazi for the order in time of Shlräzi's writing of his main cosmographical

 works, i.e. Nihäyat -> lkhtiyärät —> Tuhfa,55 then it can be said that we confront

 a qualitative model, according to which the obliquity of the ecliptic is constant, but

 both the maximum declination and eccentricity of the sun vary periodically with the

 passage of time, which is accounted for by mounting an inclined epicycle on the solar

 eccentric. It should be noted that if this is in reality the case, then the term "mayf' in

 all of the above passages should be rendered into the "maximum declination of the
 sun".

 4 Final remarks

 By the final version of the model in his Tuhfa, Shlräzl appears to display his firm adher

 ence to the already-established methodology of the Middle Eastern Islamic astronomy

 by assuming/believing that both the solar eccentricity and the obliquity of the ecliptic

 are constant. The change in the first is due to the oscillating-in-size deferent of the

 sun that is temporarily defined by the trajectory of the centre of its body, which itself

 revolves on the epicycle; in fact, the eccentricity, a constant in Ptolemaic astronomy,

 remains constant in this model, by interpreting this parameter/concept as "a length",

 not "a ratio". In this model, it is the dimension of the geocentric orbit, i.e. the diameter

 of the deferent, of the sun that oscillates with a long period equal to that of the variation

 in the maximum declination of the sun, and so, by the change of its radius, the ratio

 285

 of the length of eccentricity to the radius of the deferent varies as well. And the vari

 ation in the second is in fact because of the change in the solar maximum declination

 that is the inevitable consequence of the sun's very slow motion through its inclined

 epicycle. In the other words, the problem is no longer the variation in the obliquity

 of the ecliptic, but in the maximum declination of the sun. In fact, the problem of

 the decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic is reduced to implicitly assuming a slight
 latitude for the sun.

 Shiräzl does not derive the underlying parameters of the model and so does not

 quantify it. Both the simple trepidation theory and this solar model remained (one

 can perhaps even say that both TüsT and Shiräzl kept them) in a theoretical level in

 the cosmographic works of the hay'a genre, without achieving any application in the

 mathematical and practical astronomy. Thus, the entirety of these considerations about

 the decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic or in the maximum declination of the sun in

 Middle Eastern medieval astronomy was confined merely to a qualitative hypothesis.

 Shiräzl, of course, remarks, perhaps as an excuse, that the size of the sun's motion

 in latitude or in maximum declination (namely the amplitude of the inclination of its

 deferent either from the ecliptic or from the celestial equator) has not been precisely

 ascertained, but only its bounds/limits are known: not reaching greater than 24° and not

 being less than 23;30°. From this situation, one can generally argue that the Maragha

 astronomers had never heard of the existence of such hypotheses and the elaborately

 constructed quantitative models in the Western Islamic astronomy during almost three
 centuries before them.56

 It remains to point out that in the Tuhfa and Nihäyat, Shiräzl says that the use of

 Tüsl's Couple is generally better and more useful, by which it is the change of the

 obliquity that is accounted for, not of the maximum declination of the sun, as in the

 final version of the first model, as presented above.

 The discovery that the obliquity of the ecliptic in reality decreases seems to have

 received no attention in Eastern Islamic astronomy until TaqI al-Dln's observations
 at Istanbul in the 1570s, perhaps because the values observed in the intermediate
 period are either greater than the value 23;30° observed at Maragha (e.g. Ibn al

 56 Cf., also, Comes (2001, esp. pp. 316-318), where she made some attempts at exhibiting some traces
 of Ibn al-Zarqälluh's trepidation model in Tüsf s discussions in his Tadhkira. Although some exchanges
 might have been existed between Castile and Iran (cf. Comes 2004), it seems that there is slight chance of

 demonstrating the implication of the Andalusian trepidation models for the Maragha cosmographical works;

 two out of the three issues of similarity the late M. Comes enumerates in his 2001 study, i.e. the hypothesis

 of the proper motion of the solar apogee and the maximum bound of 24° for the obliquity of the ecliptic

 (originated in Hindu astronomy, which is, of course, different from Ibn al-Zarqälluh's maximum limit of

 23;53°) were already available in the works of Tflsl's Middle Eastern predecessors; Comes's third issue is

 al-TusI's adoption of the vernal equinox as the reference point of the trepidation; this is correct, but it can

 be simply contended that al-TflsI points to it only when he briefly describes the simple zigzag trepidation

 model, and does not identify any reference point when presenting his summary of the simple trepidation

 model of the Eastern Islamic astronomy. It should also be noted that his discussion on the trepidation in the

 Tadhkira is so abridged that can not give any insight to a probable transmission of the elements embedded in

 the model; but, ShMzfs account of the model, in which the summer solstice (Head of Cancer) is evidently

 specified as the reference point, does not leave any room for doubt that the Maragha astronomers only

 describe the simple trepidation model of Eastern Islamic origin. Moreover, Shlräzi's solar model with an

 oscillating-in-size deferent is substantially different from Ibn al-Zarqälluh's solar model with the variable
 eccentricity.

 II.4.7: his observed value 23;28,54,8°58 appears to have convinced him to assert that

 the trustworthy, sound observations since Ptolemy's time testify that the obliquity
 decreases successively. He derives the motion of the ecliptic per solar year and per

 day, and mentions that after about 91,000 years, the ecliptic coincides with the equator,
 some consequences of which he briefly explains for various geographical latitudes. His

 derived yearly and daily motions, as can be read from MS. Κ of this work, are equal,
 respectively, to 0;0,0,55,34,44,13° and 0;0,0,0,9,14,16°, which are not, of course, in

 year into account (365;14,38,34,17,8,34,17... days); he does not explain how he has
 obtained these figures, but it should be noted that the value 23;28,54,8° taken as the

 upper limit yields an annual motion of about 55"'441V.59 He later crossed out the above

 mentioned figures in the MS. K, the reason for which seems to be that he reasonably

 about the additional sphere that should contain the ecliptic and be responsible for its

 upward and downward motion; as he states, on the upper margin of f. 18v,

 We are unable to know its configuration (hay'a) and position (wad') of its poles

 with respect to the ecliptic until we know the extremal value of this decrease [in

 the obliquity], which is not facilitated, except in some thousands of years. Nev

 ertheless, on the basis of the hypotheses of this technique, I say: that sphere/orb

 contains the ecliptic, its poles are the two equinoctial points, and the plane of

 its equator (mintaqa, lit. "belt") lies in the plane of the circle passing through

 the poles [of the celestial equator and ecliptic]. It moves from the north towards

 the south to make the ecliptic coincident with the celestial equator, and then the

 two are removed from each other and the ecliptic approaches the south pole;
 thereafter, the motion becomes from the south towards the north.

 The model he puts forward in order to account for this upward and downward motion

 of the ecliptic is substantially much simpler than both models proposed by the Maragha

 astronomers: he only adds an additional sphere (the middle sphere with the axis RT

 in Fig. 3) whose poles are the equinoxes, and whose equator lies in the plane of the

 great circle passing through the poles of the celestial equator (so-called the sphere of

 Atlas, the outer/upper sphere with the axis NS) and the ecliptic (the inner/lower sphere

 with the axis PQ). It is located above the sphere of the ecliptic, and its slow periodic

 oscillatory motion around the axis passing through the equinoxes simply accounts for

 the change in the obliquity.
