 Science and Coca-Cola

 Science and Coke? You must be joking. What logical set

 could possibly include as members the epitome of knowl-
 edge and the epitome of soft drink? Here is that set: each
 is a commodity, a commercial product bought and sold in

 a competitive market, and dependent for sales upon adver-
 tising. Ads for science? With no Pepsi to challenge for
 market-share, why does science need to be advertised?
 And how could science-if we distinguish it from techno-
 logical applications-be considered commercial? Who are
 buyers and sellers of science? And without anticipation of
 profits that drive the manufacture of Coca-Cola, what
 drives the manufacture of science?

 This paper has a simple theme, with anything-but-
 simple implications for a social theory of the "rise of sci-
 ence." The manufacture of Coke and of science depend on
 the availability of money: liquid assets of the Coca-Cola
 Corporation are about $1.2 billion; scientists preparing to
 do research with a new accelerator under construction near

 Geneva by CERN will have assets of about $200 million
 for their initial round of experiments. To get this money,
 Coca-Cola sells beverage-products and scientists sell
 knowledge-products: last year, thirsty people bought $9.3
 billion of Coke world-wide and the United States govern-
 ment bought about $60 billion of scientific research and
 development. Sales of all soft drink products went up 40%
 from 1976 to 1986, but American scientists did even better:

 a 176% increase in federal funding for R&D over the last
 decade. The Coca-Cola Corporation annually spends over
 $180 million for advertisements to convince people to buy
 Coke; scientists themselves spend almost nothing on ad-

 vertising but "science-ads" still appear everywhere to con-

 vince people (states or corporations or venture capitalists)
 to buy science. If Coke-ads succeed in eliciting sales, the
 Coca-Cola Corporation stays in business; if science-ads
 succeed in eliciting sales, scientists stay in business.

 Advertising campaigns for science and Coke have much
 in common, as my illustrations will suggest: science-ads
 and Coke-ads define unique features of the two products,
 show how they are better than the competition, describe

 the variety of Coke-products and science-products for dif-
 ferent needs and for different market-segments, and lure
 consumers with the promise of tantalizing side benefits.

 But one difference is crucial: science-ads-through vari-
 ous "de-advertising mechanisms" identified below-
 create science as something other than a commodity
 commercially bought and sold in a competitive market,
 and as something not in need of advertising. Paradoxically,
 science-ads tell audiences that "this is not a science-ad" be-

 cause science is simply not like Coke at all and does not
 need to advertise. Scientists thrive (materially) because
 science is seen as a kind of public good rather than as a
 product whose sales "profit" its manufacturers, even
 though the perceived non-commercial character of science
 is accomplished in part with the same vehicle used to sell
 Coke or any other commercial good: advertising.

 My curiosity about self-denying science-ads has been
 piqued by developments in four corners of the sociology
 of science. From Paris, Latour describes how Pasteur pio-
 neered Madison Avenue techniques by convincing French

 officials that their wants were best satisfied through the

 purchase of his laboratory.1 Just as Coke carried the day in
 1952 with an advertising slogan that translated our inter-

 ests into their product ("What you want is a Coke"), Pasteur
 told French society "What you want is science." Coke-ads

 enlist Coke-drinkers as allies who satisfy their thirst while
 bringing needed revenue to the Corporation; science-ads
 enlist science-buyers as allies who satisfy their thirst for
 knowledge while bringing needed revenue to scientists.

 From York, Mulkay and friends describe the interpretative

 flexibility found in scientists' diverse accounts of science,2

 the same discursive flexibility that may be the essence of

 successful advertising. No ad can be "definitive," and char-

 acteristics of products are selectively revealed or hidden:
 a Coke-ad from 1942 that featured the slogan "Coca-Cola
 has that extra something" did not tell readers that the

 "something" might be sufficient acidity to dissolve a tooth.

 From the Science Studies Unit at Edinburgh, the work

 of Barry Barnes, Donald MacKenzie and Steven Shapin
 suggests that although scientists may have divergent polit-
 ical or ideological interests that separate them, they are
 united by a common interest in maximizing collective or
 "professional" resources and opportunities made available
 (in unequal amounts) to practitioners.3 Just as Coke and
 Pepsi share an interest in government laws protecting their
 trade-marks, American scientists have a common stake in

 lobbying to enlarge the total budget of the National Sci-
 ence Foundation (though disputes about how that pie is
 cut into disciplines can be every bit as nasty as the cola

 wars). From the Tremont Institute in San Francisco, a clus-

 In a modern society, some say that science has re-

 ter including Elihu Gerson, Leigh Star, Adele Clarke, and
 Joan Fujimura pursue Chicago-school sociology of science

 by drawing attention to the idea that the "social world" of
 science goes far beyond laboratory walls.4 The "science-
 world" must include not only Einstein's theories but a re-

 cent ad for Discovery Toys showing young Albert and his

 mother at play, with a message that if you buy your kids

 the right toys they too might grow up to discover relativity.
 Science goes on in odd places like consumer-product ads
 in Time or Newsweek, though these science-ads at tlhe same
 time remind us that science really has no business amidst
 such crass commercialism.

 Functions of Advertising

 What do ads do? Much can be learned from Michael

 Schudson's Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion, although
 its focus on national consumer goods advertising would
 seem to tell us more about Coke-ads than Science-ads. The

 placed religion in the sense that some people have an
 almost worshipful attitude toward scientific authority
 and technological progress which seems to promise
 cures, solutions and a better life. Associating things
 with science and technology can also create the sense
 (or the illusion) of accuracy, certitude and truth. Non-
 verbal images suggesting scientific authority are very
 common (labs, microscopes, white-coated doctors,
 complex machinery, computers, print-outs, synthesizer
 music, etc.) as is the use of jargon and shop talk from

 many scientific and technical areas ... There is wide-
 spread use of science to lend prestige to many products
 and services.

 SCARE AND SELL: 'attack words' intensify the op-

 posite, undesirable aspects: the lack of scientific values;

 superstition, ignorant, unskilled, illogical, unsubstanti-
 ated, inaccurate, etc."6

 The contrast between the science sociologists find in lab-

 social significance of commercial advertising is not to per-

 oratory life (where "accuracy, certitude and truth" dissolve

 suade a rather inattentive audience to buy a specific brand
 but to instill in us a "consumer culture" or a "framework for

 thought and feeling" that "extols acquisition and con-
 sumption at the expense of other values."5 The barrage of
 ads create an interpretative context in which the endless
 and even unnecessary purchase of goods has prima facie
 legitimacy: one does not have to justify "shopping."

 But this is the distanced view of a sociologist; advertising

 firms and their clients must believe (even if they cannot
 prove) that advertisements help to sell the specifically-
 mentioned product. That belief has led some advertisers

 to use "science" as a way to persuade consumers to prefer

 their brand. The claim "Scientists at a leading research uni-
 versity have discovered..." is an advertising cliche con-
 stantly testing our credibility. Why is it so common? An
 insightful discussion of science in consumer products ad-

 into political interests or contextually-contingent beliefs or

 empiricist repertoires) and the science taken-for-granted

 by advertisers and their audiences is sustained in part by
 science-ads themselves.

 To return to Schudson, ads which present scientists as
 authoritative arbiters of useful truth reproduce another
 part of "culture"-not the consumer culture-but a kind

 of "folk epistemology" or a widely shared and simple the-
 ory of knowledge that demarcates scientific knowledge
 from other brands and (importantly) puts the purchase of
 science beyond reasonable question. Science-ads depict a
 science long ago banished from our sociology of it: science
 is assumed to be truthful, reliable knowledge, produced
 by disinterested experts, serving the good of us all. Such
 "misrepresentations" of science are characteristic of con-

 sumer product advertising, Schudson says, which "simpli-

 vertisements comes not from the mountain of advertising

 fies and typifies," [and] "does not claim to picture reality

 textbooks but from a countertext designed to reveal the de-
 ceptive ploys that have become Madison Avenue stock-in-

 as it is but reality as it should be...."7

 But even the belief that science should be the fount of

 trade. The book is written by Hugh Rank and titled How

 useful and truthful knowledge capable of reliable cures

 to Analyze Ads: The Pitch: A Simple 1-2-3-4-5 Way to Under-

 stand the Basic Pattern of Persuasion in Advertising. The fol-
 lowing, long passage from Rank, which explains why
 advertisers use white lab coats and fancy statistics to sell
 products, is best read while remembering the different
 image of science that has emerged from our sociological
 studies of what goes on in laboratory life:

 'Science' is used here as a category of some human

 need or desire, a 'good thing' already wanted or desired
 by people; ads often simply associate their product or
 service with 'science' words or images, thus suggesting
 or implying an 'added value' to the buyer...,. the com-
 mon human desire for certitude (for support, reassur-
 ance, guidance, direction, approval) is related to this
 category of 'science.'

 and solutions is sufficient to legitimate its purchase. Who
 would protest an investment in scientific research that dis-

 covers "the molecule that helps reverse visible effects of
 skin's aging, as the bio-chemist Chantal Burnison claims
 for her Elastogenic Skin Treatment? That science-ad is not

 only selling "Elasyn" but the research from Burnison's lab-

 oratory that confirmed "an ingredient that doesn't just
 'plump' the skin surface momentarily ... but one that
 works." In a word: science-ads reproduce a cultural envi-
 ronment in which purchases of science from scientists, not
 immediately by you and me but by our fiduciaries in in-
 dustry and government, are made plausible, justifiable, le-
 gitimate, obvious. Few voters and fewer politicians argue
 these days that government should buy no science at all,
 although controversy continues over which science we

 CHANTAL (1986)

 THE BUSINESSMAN (1907)

 want to buy: Star Wars or a cure for AIDS.

 How do science-ads market science? The question is not
 that different from asking how Coke-ads market
 Coca-Cola.

 Coke-ads and Science-ads

 Here are some pictures of advertisements for Coca-Cola

 and for a variety of other goods and services; the originals
 appeared in mass market magazines and newspapers. My
 analysis of them is not systematic: I am interested in the
 pitch that they make for a product, and (in a subset) how
 "science" is made part of that pitch. Because space allows
 me to reproduce only a few ads, I have selected polysemic
 ones (i.e., those rich enough to allow me to make several
 sociological points), The ads were originally scattered
 throughout the last eighty years, but I have little to say
 about historical changes in the form and content of adver-
 tising or in their changing use of science. And I am not
 looking to reveal deep symbolism or hidden meanings or
 subliminal persuaders: what interests me is on the surface,
 the intended and obvious messages about Coke and about
 science.

 The complete Coke-ad tells readers what Coca-Cola is,
 who it is for, where we can get it, when we should have it,

 14 * SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY STUDIES * Vol. 5, No. 1

 why we need it, and why only Coke will do; a good example
 is "The Businessman."8 The heading at the top, and pic-
 tures of bottles and drinking glasses, leave little doubt that
 Coca-Cola is a beverage-product. But what makes this
 drink different from all other drinks? Only Coke contains
 a unique combination of coca leaf and cola nut that not
 only quenches thirst but wakes up brain and body. A weary
 businessman should take a Coke to invigorate and sustain
 himself for the next round of work. All this for only five
 cents, at drugstores everywhere (we infer this from the
 soda jerk serving up the drink). The tiny print above the
 logo reads "Guaranteed under the Pure Food and Drug
 Act, June 30th, 1906, Serial No. 3321," presumably an as-
 surance that Coca-Cola safely delivers its promised "vim
 and go" as no other soda can.

 But Coca-Cola is not only for busy businessmen. "The
 Arrow" expands the target audience to include "every-
 body, everywhere," in "every walk of life." The universal
 love of Coke is a theme that persists through the 1970s jin-

 gle "I'd like to teach the world to sing/In perfect harmony/

 I'd like to buy the world a Coke/And keep it company." No
 one, nowhere is excluded from Coke. "The Arrow" also

 confronts the problem of distinguishing the original Coca-
 Cola from a myriad of like-sounding impostors: "Be sure

 to get the genuine. Ask for it by its full name to avoid imita-

 tions and substitution." For many of us, it is only the name
 that distinguishes Coke from Pepsi (although cola addicts
 swear the two are like night and day), and that is one reason

 why Coke resisted for a long time the proliferation of prod-

 ucts bearing its brand name. At risk of confusing consum-
 ers about what really is the real thing, we now have New
 Coke, Coca-Cola Classic, Cherry Coke, Diet Coke,
 Caffeine-Free Coke ... The simplicity of one product for
 all people had obvious marketing appeal, especially for
 something sold in innumerable countries and languages.
 The diet craze forced Coke to produce a cola drink that was
 targeted only for some people: the thinning crowd. But
 "Tab" covers all bases by selling it as "just one calorie" to

 the slimming Mrs. Jackie Olmstead and by selling it as just
 "good taste" to her naturally slim children. This effort at
 market segmentation-simultaneously denied by re-
 minding consumers that anyone can enjoy any Coke
 product-is continued in the current jingle "Just for the
 taste of it ... Diet Coke."

 So when should we reach for a Coke? "Cuba" tells us: "the

 moment of fun." The ad illustrates a long-running pitch
 linking Coke to the good times and the right people; the
 product has subtly evolved from something we need to
 something less utilitarian but still desirable. Compare
 "Cuba" from the 1950s to "The Bridge Player" from the

 1930s. In "Cuba," we associate Coca-Cola with pleasant
 moments lying around on the beach, and with the lucky
 people who can afford such leisure (if Coke is also for the
 poor-as claimed in "The Arrow"-we never see them in

 their ads). Water might do for that dull everyday thirst, but
 the fun thirst you get with your tan is made for Coke. In

 "The Bridge Player," Coke is something without which we

 are not "normal." Its restorative power is needed to prevent
 that fatal gaffe: yawning when you are supposed to be
 having too good a time to be tired or (worse) bored. So: we

 need Coke to stay awake, but we should want it even when
 we do not need it: are those beachcombers in "Tab' and

 "Cuba" trying to stay alert? Coke can be an upper or a
 downer, it seems, and since those are the only two ways
 to go, it is right anytime.

 "The Bridge Player" begins our move from Coke-ads to

 science-ads. If you do not believe Coke's claims for its prod-
 ucts, then take it on the authority of "foremost scientists"

 who say that it really works "in restoring you to your normal
 self." The epitome of a Coke-and-science-ad is "The Testi-
 monies." Unfortunately, I do not know where this "text"
 was first published (the tearsheet I examined had no iden-

 tifying reference); it is not obviously an ad for anything. So
 let me invent a scenario that may be like the one in 1905

 that produced this text. The setting, say, is the office of a

 to run any more of your ads in our magazine. Some of
 our subscribers have been, well, talking about what
 might be in Coca-Cola. You know how we Methodists
 are about alcohol and those sorts of things. A few be-

 lieve that there might be cocaine or some other drug ...
 COKE: Now wait just a minute. Don't tell me that you
 believe that rumor?

 EDITOR: Well, your ads do mention coca leaves, and
 anyway-how are we supposed to know what is or isn't
 in the stuff?

 COKE: Take my word for it: there's no cocaine in Coca-
 Cola. I swear.

 EDITOR: That won't work. Nobody would believe you
 or anyone else at your Company.
 COKE: Why not? We know what goes into the syrup,
 and I'm telling you there is nothing in it that a Methodist
 could not drink.

 EDITOR: Now don't get upset. I'm not accusing you of
 anything. I mean, really: the magazine badly needs

 your ads. You pay for about half our costs for each issue.
 But you guys are also in business, and there are too
 many Doubting Thomases in our Church who think
 you'd tell us anything so long as we kept drinking
 Coca-Cola.

 COKE: I have a plan. If you guys won't take my word
 for it, let's find someone who you can trust.
 EDITOR: Any ideas?
 COKE: I just happen to have these two letters with me,
 one is from the State Chemist and the other from a sci-

 entist up in New York who manufactures cocaine and
 other alkaloids.

 EDITOR: What's an alkaloid?

 COKE: Don't ask me. Seems they have done some ex-
 periments on Coca-Cola and found no traces of cocaine
 or any other illicit substances. Maybe you could run
 these letters as testimonials to our purity.
 EDITOR: Scientists? Do they believe in the Bible or that
 evolution hogwash? Besides, why should I trust them?
 You might be in cahoots with these guys.
 COKE: This guy is a chemist; he has no financial stake
 in the outcome. He gets paid by the State. He is sup-
 posed to, protect us, right? Are you accusing me of brib-

 ing a public official? Look, it says he bought our syrup

 THE TESTIMONIES (1905?)

 on the open market. We didn't slip him anything spe-
 cial. This is all above board.

 This scenario (in compact form) is rehearsed when any
 ad-writer and client decide to involve "science" in an ad-

 EDITOR: How do I know he really did any experiment-
 ing on the syrup?
 COKE: Where else do you think he got these numbers
 like 1.37 grains of this and .2472 grains of that. You don't

 get that kind of accuracy unless you're doing real scien-
 tific research.

 EDITOR: Maybe these chemists wouldn't know cocaine
 if it bit them on the nose.

 COKE: Well, look at this other letter. The man has long
 experience in the chemistry of alkaloids. I mean, he is
 an expert. And he says that the cocaine would have
 "pronounced characteristics." He couldn't miss it. Be-

 sides, he repeated those fractional whatevers and kept
 finding the same nothing. I tell you, there really is noth-
 ing funny in Coca-Cola. And he even went to the trou-
 ble to get the letter notarized.

 EDITOR: If this scientist is so trustworthy, why do I need
 the assurance of a notary public?
 COKE: Be reasonable. We've got two testimonials from
 two experts who have never met. Isn't that enough to
 make you confident that they've got it right?
 EDITOR: Ok, let's print them both and see what hap-
 pens. Cup of coffee for you?

 vertisement. The sociological beauty of "The Testimonies"
 is that, unlike later ads that typically rely on synechdoche
 (as in "Chesterfield," where microscope and white coat
 hint at science tout court), the case for trusting scientists is
 elaborate. Readers are told that scientists are disinterested,

 that they have no material stake in the outcome. The titles
 "Professor" and "Doctor" establish credentials and, pre-
 sumably, certify their training. The experiments measure
 nature, converting "sweet" into a specific gravity of 1.28
 due to sugar. That precision, and the use of technical terms

 like "alkaloid," establish scientific knowledge as more than

 common sense. It is the kind of knowledge only specialized

 experts can provide: years of experience in alkaloid chem-
 istry were needed. Conclusions in science are based on in-
 dependent but reproducible results of experiments with
 nature.

 This is all spelled out in "The Testimonies"; but these
 same assumptions form a widely-shared folk epistemol-
 ogy evoked by the mere whisper of "science." No better evi-
 dence can be found than "Chesterfield," in which the

 jumbled images and assertions create a parody of the
 science-ad. The "science" is presumably the testing done
 with a "taste panel" as reported by a "well-known research

 organization." But how does one use a microscope to detect
 taste? And if ash from that cigarette were to fall on the
 slide, it would look like a dinosaur! No matter. Take it from

 science: Chesterfield really does taste better.

 "R.J. Reynolds" does a more effective job in reminding

 us of what we all know about science. It carefully reviews

 the logic of scientific method, and may well do a better job

 of selling science than cigarettes. Here we read an explica-
 tion of why scientific knowledge is more reliable than non-

 scientific brands: the credibility of its conclusions can be
 traced back to the unique methods of its production. The
 ad suggests that "scientists" who violate these methods by

 retaining a theory in the face of non-corroborative findings
 (or by converting bivariate correlation into causation) have
 left science for the realm of "opinion." Science is factual
 "proof," not "judgment" (as we are reminded in the current
 General Motors slogan "Science not Fiction"). Notice how
 the ad deftly avoids the problem of maintaining scientific
 credibility when scientists offer different truth: those
 other scientists who tell you that smoking causes coronary
 heart disease are simply not being scientific-they violate
 the method.

 the future, to a better world, to progress, to new solutions

 of old human ills. "Crest" links its "Flouristan" to the history

 of scientific medicine's triumph over disease: Jenner's inoc-
 ulation to Fleming's penicillin to Crest's toothpaste. Sci-
 ence did what common-sense could not: those happy
 Western parents with cavity-free kids had no idea why
 they were so lucky. Scientists converted common sense
 into a discovery and then into a uniquely effective new
 technology that marks a "turning point in man's age-old
 struggle against this almost universal disease." Crest is ob-

 viously trying to sell toothpaste, but Procter and Gamble's

 ad effectively promotes science as a "public good" benefit-
 ting us all. Who could deny the desirability of "the long-
 dreamed of day of healthy decay-free teeth?" As
 advertisements for Dupont used to say: "Better living
 through chemistry."

 In "Champion,"science again becomes an unassailable
 public good and a fount of the better world: genetic engi-
 neering, for example, will be "a boon to children with
 stunted growth." But what is being sold here? It is almost
 incidental that gene splicing will allow Champion to grow
 a more profitable tree. In 1980 as now, genetic engineering

 easily made by talking about cures for hepatitis, flu and
 cancer (public good) than by talking about profitable trees

 few consumers fail to recognize such claims as ploys to sell
 a product made by a manufacturer whose coffers expand
 if we believe them. We recognize Coke as a commodity
 being sold to us. Science too is a commodity, but sales of
 (private gain). Obviously, scientists engaged in genetic en-
 gineering (both in private and public sectors) can only
 scientists' products depend in part on them not being rec-
 ognized as commodities. Science could become perceived
 champion Champion's efforts: they, too, "profit." But the
 ad cautions-in its litany of troubling questions raised by
 as a commodity if science-ads are seen and read as Coke-
 genetic engineering-that science will continue to move
 ads: "buy this knowledge so that scientists can stay in the
 research business." Compensating mechanisms are
 us into the better world only if it can "retain its necessary
 needed to preclude the idea that science is just another
 purity and freedom in a commercial situation." The mira-

 cles of science are polluted by the world of money.

 De-Advertising Science

 Science-ads present a paradoxical problem for advertis-

 ers who use science to sell consumer products, and poten-
 tially an even greater problem for scientists. As Rank
 observed, science sells Coke or skin care products because
 we assume its findings are reliably truthful and because
 we suspect that they emanate from disinterested and ob-
 jective experts working in value- and interest-free research
 contexts shielded from compromising pressures found in
 commercial or ideological marketplaces. This is the pitch
 for science-but in order to work for advertisers of con-

 I call these compensations "de-advertising mecha-

 nisms," and both scientists and advertisers who use sci-
 ence have a stake in their effectiveness. Advertisers can

 continue to use science as a ploy to assure consumers of

 the truth of their claims only if the folk epistemology defin-

 ing science as the epitome of reliably truthful accounts of
 nature remains more or less intact. Scientists benefit in two

 ways: if science is perceived as reliably truthful knowl-
 edge, its purchase by public fiduciaries (i.e., the state) is
 taken-for-granted as legitimate because it is seen as a com-
 mon public good rather than as a commodity whose pur-
 chase benefits sectarian interests (of scientists, for

 example). Also, if advertisers continue to use science in
 their ads, scientists benefit from the broadcasted repro-

 duction of this folk epistemology without paying for it. The
 danger is for science to become too much like Coke: as
 something we buy that directly benefits producers or pur-
 veyors whose interest in maximizing sales could jeopar-
 dize the accuracy of proffered descriptions of nature.

 The paradox: Scientists rely on science-ads to reproduce

 a folk epistemology that defines their accomplishments as

 the epitome of reliably truthful and useful knowledge, and

 that presents an unquestionable prima facie case for their
 purchase. But if science-ads are seen merely as ads their

 message is lost: can we believe claims to reliability and ac-
 curacy (or even utility) if scientists are-like Coke--
 dependent on sales driven by these advertisements?

 De-advertising mechanisms allow science-ads to sell
 science without our recognition that this is what is hap-
 pening, and here are some examples. Science-ads tell us
 why we should want more science, but they do not tell us

 what we need to know in order to buy some of it. In effect,
 science-ads break almost every rule in advertising text-

 rider in a pitch to buy toothpaste or skin treatments. R. J.
 Reynolds bought that page in Family Circle magazine in
 order to sell its cigarettes. How could science be a commod-

 ity if ads for it are bought not by scientists (the indirect ben-
 eficiaries) but by those who are using science to sell
 cigarettes or forest products or Coke?9

 There are exceptions of course, but some only prove the
 rule. The most explicit exhortation for ad-readers to buy
 science (that I have found) is not in a consumer-product
 ad but in a "public service message" for the Heart Fund (la-

 beled "Giraffe").1o The ad explicitly recognizes that scien-
 tists need dollars, but the altruistic goal of this research
 disconnects the plea from a commercial context. Science

 is established as a public good available and benefitting us

 all, rather than a market exchange that enables scientists

 to stay employed. This idea is reinforced by the absence

 of advertisements for competitors of science urging con-

 sumers to prefer their brand of knowledge or expertise. The
 competitive and commercial nature of Coke is obvious in
 a Pepsi-Cola ad showing a 21st-century archaeologist dig-

 ging up a Coke bottle that he cannot identify, as the camera

 books, in that they fail to identify the product in an easily

 recognizable way, to tell us the point-of-sale and the price,

 and to make us see ourselves as realistic buyers. In the early
 ads for Coke (before everyone came to know everything

 about it), readers were told that you should buy this bubbly
 beverage for only five cents at the corner soda fountain.
 All the information is there to achieve the advertisements'

 goal: to convert a magazine reader into a Coke-buyer. By
 contrast, science-buyers are left in the dark. The easily-
 grasped bottle of Coke becomes the enigmatic "knowl-

 edge" or "trust" or "expertise"; dollars and cents are rarely

 I have not seen an ad extolling the virtues of "ignorance"
 (one alternative to science), and generally ads for scien-
 tists' competition come not from commercial products but

 from alternative belief systems (as in an ad for religion that
 recommends the Bible over evolution). The near-absence

 of ads for competitors sustains the image that science is
 unique (in a category of its own) and an undeniable good
 (only the irrational could prefer the alternative).

 My restricted focus on science in consumer-product ad-
 vertising must be relaxed if one further kind of de-

 mentioned; we are never told where science is bought and

 advertising is to be identified. Advertisers call "marketing

 sold. Readers of science-ads cannot see themselves as buy-

 mix" the variety of ways producers get their products in

 ers of science from scientists, even though they are buyers
 of science when they purchase consumer goods produced

 (or marketed) with the aid of scientists or when they pay
 taxes to finance federal "patronage" of research.

 All of the clues to seeing science as involved in commer-

 cial transactions are missing, not because it is not bought
 and sold like Coke but because its sales depend on its not
 being seen like Coke. This might explain why, in "Crest,"
 the discoverers of inoculation, ether, and penicillin are
 mentioned by name but Harry G. Day and his colleagues
 at Indiana University who discovered stannous fluoride
 become the generic white-coated scientist holding a test
 tube. (Proctor and Gamble did indeed support Day's re-
 search, and Indiana University has since benefitted mater-

 front of consumers. Coke has not limited itself to print
 mass media: we have been subjected to video ads, bill-
 boards and other outdoor signs, promotional trays and
 toys and calendars, cents-off coupons, displays at the
 points of sale, visible sponsorship of artistic or sporting
 events and (now) trendy and expensive clothing with the

 irrepressible logo. Science, too, is marketed in a variety of

 ways that further obscure its identification as a commodity

 bought and sold (in part) for the financial support of scien-
 tists. Where do we meet science? I remember: childhood

 "field trips" to a natural history museum, "Mr Wizard" on

 TV, my first chemistry set ("You, too, can turn water into
 wine!"), dusty shelves of National Geographic, an adoles-
 cent "science project" ill-titled The Sceince of Plant-Growth

 ially from the sale of Crest toothpaste.) The authoritative
 disinterestedness of science is enhanced by its depersona-
 lization: to mention Day by name raises questions about
 his financial relationship to the Corporation that profited
 so much from the discovery. That disinterestedness is en-

 and the scientific dismemberment of a frog in biology
 class. Things have not changed much: my sons at ages six
 and seven know that paleontologists are those scientists
 lucky enough in their view to spend their lives studying
 dinosaurs (what could be less commercial?).

 hanced again by the correct assumption that scientists are
 not the sponsors of science-ads: science becomes a free-

 The point: none of the settings where we form our early

 and enduring images of science are businesslike. In choos-

 ing to look at science-ads in magazines and newspapers,

 science can distinctively satisfy their needs; indeed, the

 I have chosen perhaps the "toughest case," for the link be-
 tween science and business could easily be inferred here

 advertising even tells us what we need. No history of Coca-
 Cola is complete without several chapters on its advertis-

 (as in the Rockwell International slogan "... where science
 gets down to business"), and would be inferred if not for

 de-advertising. Science-ads are not recognized as ads be-
 cause all of our other contacts with science have little obvi-

 ous commercial relevance. By the time we are able to read
 consumer-product advertisements that mention science,
 we bring to them assumptions about science that picture
 it as completely unlike Coca-Cola. This does not reduce the
 importance of science-ads in reproducing those long-ago

 learned assumptions that science is the epitome of reliably
 useful knowledge about the world. Schudson says that re-

 production is the goal of most consumer product advertis-
 ing, which talks to "the already converted" hoping "to
 affect people who are already committed to a general

 product category.""1

 De-advertising mechanisms preserve the distinctive
 selling-points of science: its status as a public good of uni-

 ing and marketing; that is also the case for a history of

 science. Claims by scientists to the Truth or Utility of their

 knowledge are not viewed (from this theoretical angle) as

 definitive descriptions of what science yields but as a pitch
 for its purchase, not unlike the 1947 slogan "The quality
 of Coca-Cola is a friendly quality you can always trust."

 We lack systematic studies of ubiquitous efforts by sci-
 entists and allies to sell their expertise and accomplish-
 ments in a competitive knowledge-market. Those studies

 would identify the occasions in which science is advertised

 (from primary school science-textbooks to appeals by sci-

 entists before Congressional committees reviewing budg-
 ets for the National Science Foundation), the
 contextually-contingent content of the "sales pitch," the
 different characteristics of buyers at various "points of
 sale." The research would focus on how scientists meet the

 competition: what arguments are used to convince poten-

 versal aid, its promise of a new and better world resulting

 tial buyers that extant knowledge is insufficient ("more re-

 from useful and truthful discoveries about nature by disin-

 terested expert specialists not concerned about the bottom
 line. The de-advertising mechanisms found in science-ads
 and elsewhere demarcate science from business, and mini-
 mize the skepticism readers bring to ads for
 Coca-Cola.

 A Concluding Agenda

 search is needed"); that scientific knowledge is superior to
 non-scientific kinds marketed by other knowledge-
 producers such as religionists, ideologues, politicians, law-
 yers, soothsayers or you and me"2; and that one kind of
 science is preferable to another (disciplines sometimes
 compete among themselves selling distinctive brands of

 scientific expertise and authority). All this should add up
 to a better understanding of folk epistemologies-diverse

 and often implicit assumptions about types of knowledge
 and their relations and utilities-that sustain a cultural

 Such a paper as this can have no conclusion, for it is but

 a slim beginning to possibly fruitful lines of inquiry. The
 extended parallel of science and Coca-Cola is designed to
 provoke a reconceptualization of sociological theories
 about the historical "rise of science." That should really be
 "rise of scientists," for the central message is that the
 growth of scientific knowledge is dependent upon scien-
 tists' acquisition of the material and symbolic resources
 needed to do research and to broadcast results. A "social

 theory of science" must be able to explain three centuries
 of improvements (with only an occasional slide) in these

 context in which purchases of science only rarely face suc-
 cessful challenge. To better understand the culture that

 typically defines science as the epitome of reliably useful
 knowledge requires studies of how science gets done out-
 side laboratories and journals-in advertisements for
 consumer-products, as one small example-though the
 findings there will tell us much about why and how labo-
 ratories and journals acquire the wherewithal to exist.

 In 1986, both Coca-Cola in Atlanta and the Pasteur In-

 working conditions of scientists: the prestige of their occu-

 stitute in Paris celebrated their centennial as two of the

 pation, the money they receive for services rendered (in the

 forms of wages, grants, facilities), their authority over
 questions of fact, and the autonomy to pursue their own

 curiosities. The comparison to Coke suggests a kind of ex-
 planation that is not effective: the spectacular financial
 success of the Coca-Cola Corporation cannot be explained

 by the immanent qualities of Coke (it really is a sweet fizzy
 liquid, but so is Pepsi) nor by the innate thirstiness of hu-
 mans (let them drink water). So: the spectacular financial
 success of scientists cannot be explained by immanent
 qualities of the procedures or products of scientific re-
 search nor by an innate human "need to know." Both Coke

 and science thrive because of their successful marketing:
 potential buyers must be told (repeatedly) how Coke and

 most successful marketing campaigns in the history of...
 business? "Things go better with science!"

 a strong linkage between the outcomes of science policies

 and the development of the international scientific litera-

 ture. The base for this linkage is not "authors" but articles,
 or to put it more technically: document sets. The crucial

 question becomes: what makes a scientific article a signifi-

 cant contribution? From this perspective, science policy is-
 sues inevitably assume a more cognitive aspect.

 9. Scientists are of two minds on the use of science in advertising and,
 more generally, on its presentation in mass media. The ambivalence is

 noted in Dorothy Nelkin's brand new book Selling Science: How the Press

 Covers SciCece and Technology (New York: W H. Freeman, 1987 at page
 169): "Scientists today see improved press coverage as a means of fulfilling
 their obligation to bring science to the public and attracting support from
 legislators, corporate leaders, and foundation executives. But they have
 also carried over values from a time when science was less accountable and

 more isolated from public affairs. ... [Scientists] worry about the corruptive
 influence on science of self-promotion and the encouragement of scientists
 more skilled in public relations than in research."
