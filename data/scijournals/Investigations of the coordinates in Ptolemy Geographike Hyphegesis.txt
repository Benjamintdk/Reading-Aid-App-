 Abstract In Book 8 of his Geographike Hyphegesis Ptolemy gives coordinates for
 ca. 360 so-called noteworthy cities. These coordinates are the time difference to Alex

 andria, the length of the longest day, and partly the ecliptic distance from the summer
 solstice. The supposable original conversions between the coordinates in Book 8 and
 the geographical coordinates in the location catalogue of Books 2-7 including the
 underlying parameters and tabulations are here reconstructed. The results document
 the differences between the Q- and S-recension. The known difference in the lon

 gitude of Alexandria underlying the conversion of the longitudes is examined more

 closely. For the ecliptic distances from the summer solstice of the S3-recension, it is

 revealed that they were originally computed by means of a so far undiscovered approx

 imate, linear conversion. Further it is shown that the lengths of the longest day could
 be based on a linear interpolation of the data in the Mathematike Syntaxis 2.6.

 Fig. 1 Overview of the chapters in Book 8 (£. Europe, Af. Africa, As. Asia)

 sixty of these localities are additionally listed with coordinates in Book 8 of the Geog

 raphy. In contrast to the location catalogue, the positions in Book 8 are expressed by
 means of

 - the time difference A (in hours) from the location to Alexandria,

 - the length of the longest day M (in hours) at the location,
 - the ecliptic distance S (in arc degree) of the sun from the summer solstice at the

 time when the sun reaches the zenith (for locations between the tropics).

 The localities in Book 8 are selected cities, the so-called poleis episemoi ("noteworthy

 cities"). They are arranged in 26 chapters; each chapter is related to one of the maps
 Ptolemy divided the Oikoumene into (the inhabited world known to the Greeks and
 Romans). Figure 1 shows a general view of the sites of the single maps (see also
 Stuckelberger and GraBhoff 2006).

 Since the positions of the poleis episemoi are given in the location catalogue and
 in Book 8, a comparison of the positions of both sources is possible after a conver
 sion of coordinates. The poleis episemoi also appear in another of Ptolemy's works,
 the Procheiroi Kanones (Handy Tables; hereinafter denoted Canon). Unlike Book 8,
 the coordinates are given there in form of geographical coordinates as in the location

 catalogue of the Geography.

 A conversion of the A- and M-data in Book 8 into geographical coordinates can be
 found in Cuntz (1923) and in Stuckelberger and Mittenhuber (2009). The latter con
 tains an edition of the Canon with a compilation of the corresponding geographical
 coordinates of the GH 2-7 and the converted values A (A) and <J>(M) on the basis
 of Book 8. Cuntz examines four maps of Europe (GH 8.5-8). He supposes that A
 and M in Book 8 originate from the geographical coordinates in Books 2-7. By his
 assumptions about the precision of A and M as well as about tabulations underlying
 A and M, he makes an attempt to explain the coordinate values in Book 8 (see Sects.

 2 and 3). Honigmann (1929, p. 64 ff.) assumes that the data of the poleis episemoi
 in Book 8 as well as in Books 2-7 were derived from works by a predecessor of
 Ptolemy.

 In the following, the conversions of coordinates between the location catalogue
 and Book 8 are investigated. The underlying calculation methods and their parameters
 are worked out as well as the underlying tabulations. Deviations between the coor
 dinates in Book 8 and in the location catalogue are explained as comprehensively as
 possible by the resolution (precision) of the coordinates. As source for the data of the

 Geography, the edition of Stuckelberger and GraBhoff (2006) was used (for changes
 on the data see Appendix). It contains the coordinates of the two main recensions of

 the Geography, the Q- and E-recension. The latter one has been handed down only by
 the X-manuscript; its location catalogue ends in Book 5, Chapter 13, so that a direct
 comparison with the data in Book 8 is not possible. Both Q and X are considered in

 the present work. Stuckelberger and GraBhoff (2006, p. 44) state that many A/-values
 of X seem to be based on the coordinates of the Canon. The relation between the

 coordinates in Book 8 and the Canon is only broached here. The coordinates used are
 based on the edition of the Canon by Stuckelberger and Mittenhuber (2009).

 2 Time difference to Alexandria

 The conversion between the time difference to Alexandria A (in hours) and the lon

 gitude A (in degree) is

 A = A 15°/h + A A (1)

 Cuntz (1923, p. 101 ff.) investigates the coordinates of the 3. to 6. map in GH 8.5-8

 (Europe, 42 localities). He states that both 60°30' and 60°00' underlie the time dif
 ferences Ai (i — 1, 2,..., number of coordinates n) and that it is not possible to
 determine the Aa the coordinates are based on in all cases. His explanation for dif
 ferent Aa is that Ptolemy upgraded the value 60°30' to 60°00' and added the updated

 Ai in a further column besides the values underlying 60°30'; later copyists chose one

 of the values. Stuckelberger and GraBhoff (2006, p. 44) mention that 60° primarily
 underlies the data of Q as well as 60°30' the data of X.

 2.1 Conversion of coordinates and accuracy

 Ptolemy explicitly declares in GH 8.2.1 that the time differences A, in Book 8 are

 approximate values; thus, equality after a conversion between the data of Books 2-7
 and Book 8 is not to be expected. For the following conversions of coordinates, the

 with the longitude of Alexandria Aa (in degree). Ptolemy gives two different values
 for Aa in the Geography, in the location catalogue 60°30' =: Aa (4.5.9) and in
 Book 8 4h =: Aa (8.15.10; the distance between Alexandria and the zero merid
 ian); in GH 7.5.14, he gives both values. The difference between both parameters is
 AAa := Aa - Aa = 60°30' - 60° = 30' = 2min.

 Fig. 2 Frequency of differences AA; = A/ — A (A,) between the longitudes A; of the location catalogue
 and the longitudes A(Aj) computed from the time differences A, to Alexandria of Book 8 by means of Eq.
 (1) for the £2-recension (left) and the X-manuscript (right); Aa is the longitude of Alexandria underlying
 the conversion

 difference Ay between the conversion y(x) of a coordinate x and the given coordinate

 value y is defined as

 Ay = y- y(x). (2)

 Then Ay is the error of y with respect to y(x).
 Both Aa and A a were used here for the conversion of coordinates. For the conver

 sion/1 !-* AbyEq.(l), Fig. 2 shows the frequencies of differences A A,- = A/—A (A,)
 lying within specified intervals (interval width 10'). For Q the conversion with Aa
 gives a maximal frequency near zero and with Aa near —30'. That is the negative sys
 tematic difference A Aa and indicates that the majority of the coordinates were origi
 nally converted with Aa = 60°. In X, the conditions are converse so that Aa = 60°30'
 must be the main parameter of the original conversion. The frequency distribution is
 bimodal; the distance of the lower second peak from the main peak is 30'. Hence, the

 second peak is probably caused by A,- which are based on the corresponding other A\.

 The size of the differences A A, can mainly be explained by a original conversion

 A h> A in conjunction with a rounding of A. Apart from a few exceptions, the largest
 denominator of the fractions of the A, is 30 (1/30h = 2min). Cuntz (1923, p. 108)
 assumes an original precision of !/l2h = 5 min (= 1° 15').1 In general, if a number is
 rounded with a precision (resolution) a = 1 /d, the expected maximal rounding error
 is

 = ±^- (3)

 For a = 5 min, emax is 2.5 min ~ 2/3°. This agrees with that part of the tail of the
 frequency distribution which is not extended by the systematic difference AA\ (see
 Fig. 2).

 Cuntz (1923, p. 108) gives a tabulation of A- and A-values with a step size of
 AA = 5 min (AA = I1/40) by which A-values may have been determined. Cuntz

 1 Honigmann (1929), who discusses Cuntz' work, does not dissent.

 supposes that in the case of a A, which does not equal a tabulated A the nearest
 tabulated A was chosen. In the end Cuntz cannot explain several A,- by means of the
 tabulation. The use of a tabulation described by Cuntz was applied here to the entire
 A-data of Book 8. A tabulation was generated for Aa and Aa- In the case of £2 61 %
 and in the case of X 51 % of the A-values determined by one of both tabulations equal
 the Aj given in Book 8. Furthermore a tabulation with A A = 2.5 min was tested; the
 result are 61 and 55 %. That does not argue for the use of a tabulation. Cuntz gives
 the example of Lugdunum (8.5.5) with A = 23°15' and A = — 2h30m. The nearest
 tabulated A is 23° so that A becomes — 2h30m. However, this might also be the result

 of Eq. (1) and a rounding: A(A) = —2h29m.

 2.2 Determination of Aa and the resolution

 Considering the single chapters of Book 8, there are chapters whose longitudes are
 converted with one of both Aa mainly; in other cases, the underlying Aa cannot be
 recognized reliably. The question of the A a underlying a single A led to an attempt

 to determine Aa for each locality by means of the following method. A, is converted
 with Aa to A(A,) and with Aa to A(A,) by Eq. (1). A,- and A;- are rounded with
 different precisions a to determine the apparent resolution of the given A, . In general

 terms, the two coordinates x and y of different types are given as well as the converted

 coordinate y(x). Furthermore, a main resolution as is set. The procedure applied is then

 Procedure ROUND:

 (1) Round y{x) to the precision as; if Ay = y — y(x) = 0 end.
 (2) For each of the precisions a < as downwards: round y(x); if Ay = 0 end.
 (3) For each of the precisions a > as upwards: round v (x); if Ay = 0 end.

 If Ay becomes 0, the apparent resolution of y is found; if Ay does not become 0 until
 the end, an erroneous y or x can be assumed.

 Procedure ROUND was applied to the A,- and A,-. The results of a comparison with

 the given A,- were valued as follows:

 (1) rounded A, = A, or/and rounded A, = A,-:

 (a) only rounded A,- = A,- : A,- is apparently based on Aa;
 (b) only rounded A,- = A,- : A,- is apparently based on Aa;
 (c) rounded A,- = A,- and rounded A,- = A,- : A A,- = A,—A,-, A A; = A,—A,

 (i) |AA,| < | A A,-1 : A,- is possibly based on Aa;
 (ii) | AAZ-1 > | A A,-1 : A,- is possibly based on Aa;
 (iii) |AA, | = |AA;|: no decision possible;

 (2) rounded A,- ^ A,-and rounded A,- ^ A;: no decision possible, maybe a corrupted

 A,-value.

 The possible resolutions for Procedure ROUND were chosen according to the denom
 inators of the fractions which occur in Book 8. The resolutions used for £2 are (in h):

 A a, red! triangle A does not fit with A. (Color figure online)

 V360,1/60, 1/30,1/24, '/i5, V12, '/io, 1/8,1/7, 1/6, and 1/5.2 For X 1/60 and 1/7 were not used, and

 1/20 and 1/9 were added. The main resolution was set to as = 1/12 h (following Cuntz

 1923) and for a further run to as = 1/24 h. The results for the portions of apparent
 resolutions are:

 - as = i/i2h:

 - as = '/24 h:

 - £2: a = as:61 %,a < as: 34%,a > as:4%,no fitting rounding: 1 %;
 - X: a = as: 51 %,a < as: 36%, a > as: 9%, no fitting rounding: 4%;

 - £2:a = as:61 %,a < as: 24%,a > as: 14%,no fitting rounding: 1 %;
 - X: a = as: 55 %,a < as: 23 %, a > as: 19 %,no fitting rounding: 4%.

 The result indicates that not only as = 1/24 h is the main resolution, but as =
 1/12 h also comes into consideration. The result of Procedure ROUND applied with
 as — 1/24 h shows that ca. 80 % of the localities have only small absolute differences
 < 0.5 • 1/24h = 1/48h = 1.25min (cf. Eq. (3)) between A,- and A(A,) converted by
 Eq. (1). Further, almost all A,- can be explained by conversion based on either Aa or
 Aa and a rounding. Hence, the vast majority of the differences between the given A,
 and the converted A (A,) are explicable by the precision of the A,-. Consequently, the
 location catalogue and Book 8 show a high level of interdependence.

 The determined frequencies of A a and A a are

 - £2: Aa: 107 (31 %), Aa:209 (61 %), AAorAA:25 (7%),no fitting rounding:3

 (1 %);

 - X: Aa: 137 (62 %), Aa: 63(29 %), Aa or Aa: 11 (5 %), no fitting rounding: 9 (4 %).

 This again reveals that A a dominates in X and A a in Q (with a ratio of ca. 2:1).

 2 The denominator 360 does not really occur but was introduced because of the occurrence of the sum
 1/8 + I/90 = 49/360 (see Stiickelberger and GraBhoff 2006, p. 883, n. 65).

 Figures 3 and 4 show the result of the classification for each locality in
 the Ptolemaic coordinate system (Aa: blue/circle, Aa: yellow/circle, A a or Aa:
 green/square, no fitting rounding: red/triangle). In £2, the dominant Aa occurs nearly
 exclusively in the east, and in the west also Aa occurs often. There are in £2
 13 chapters in which A a dominates: Europe 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, Asia 3, 5-11; in 2
 chapters Aa dominates: Europe 7, Africa 2. In X Aa dominates in 8 chapters:
 Europe 2, 5, 7, 10, Africa 2—4, Asia 1; Aa dominates in 2 chapters: Europe 1,
 Asia 2.

 2.3 Comparison of £2 and X

 Finally, the A, of Q and X were compared. Three hundred and forty three values
 are equal and 143 values have differences, thereof 16 localities also have differences
 in A in the location catalogue so that 143 — 16 = 127 A; remain with actual dif
 ferences between Q and X (37%). Besides the expected systematic difference of
 AAa = 30' = 2 min also other differences occur comparably often: 2.5 min = >/24h,
 3 min = '/20h, 4min = Vi5h, and 5 min = l/l2h. This is explicable by the precision
 of the A,. As an example Clunia (8.4.5) is considered: In £2 A is — 3h15m, that is
 A = 11°00' converted with A a = 60° to A = —3h16m and rounded to the nearest
 1/12h. In X A is —3h20m, that is A converted with Aa = 60°30' to A = — 3h18m and

 rounded to the nearest '/i2h. The systematic difference of AAa = 2min becomes
 5 min here.

 Figure 5 shows the localities without (green/circle) and with differences in A
 between Q and X (Ptolemaic system). Those with differences are divided into local
 ities with difference in A (yellow/triangle), without difference in A (red/triangle),
 and the remaining localities (magenta/square) which have no A in the location cat
 alogue of X. Localities with differences disperse across the whole area; however,
 they often occur in local groups. In the west, there is a larger amount of differ
 ences.

 3 Length of the longest day

 The length of the longest day M increases from 12 h at the equator (<t> = 0) to 24h
 for 0 = 90° — e. Ptolemy derives the computation of <t> from M and vice versa in his
 Mathematike Syntaxis (MS) 2.3. The modern formulation of that relation between M
 and <f> is

 (4)

 (M in hours) with the obliquity of the ecliptic e.3 In MS 2.6 Ptolemy gives a compi
 lation of parallels with specific M including their latitudes (see Sect. 3.5).

 Ptolemy does not explicitly mention the e underlying the conversion between <J> and

 M in the Geography. In GH 7.6.7 he gives the ratio e : */2 ~ 4/l5> that is the roughly
 rounded value 90° • 4/15 = 24° =: er for e. In MS 1.12 Ptolemy states that the arc
 between the solstice points (i.e. 2e) is approximately (11/83) • 360°. That is 47°42'40"
 so that s becomes 23°51'20" =: em (Manitius 1912, p. 44). Other appearances of em
 are MS 1.14 and 2.4, where Ptolemy uses this value for exemplary computations, as
 well as the "Table of Inclination" in MS 1.15, where em occurs as the size of the arc of

 meridian with an ecliptic longitude of 90° (see Sect. 4). The correct value of Ptolemy's
 time is 23°41' =: sc so that em has an error of about 11'.

 Rawlins (1985) gives two groups of cities of Book 8, on the one hand 10 cities,

 whose M and <t> could be related by Eq. (4) through 23°50' ~ em, on the other hand
 7 cities, whose M and <t> could be related through 23°55' =: eh. Rawlins attributes
 the latter value to Hipparchus (see also Rawlins 1982) so that the original conversion

 3 Trigonometric problems could be solved accurately in antiquity by using tabulations of chords as it can
 be found in MS 1.11. On ancient trigonometry used by Ptolemy and described in his MS see Neugebauer
 (1975, p. 21 ff.).

 and the latitudes <P(M, ) computed from the lengths of the longest day M,■ of Book 8 by Eq. (4) for the

 would have been done with that value before Ptolemy. A further hint to eT — 24° used
 in Ptolemy's data was detected by Neugebauer (1975, pp. 236, 245 ff.), who found
 er underlying the data in the tables for the first and last visibility of the planets in
 MS 13.10. The question of the s underlying the M, in Book 8 is considered in the
 following.

 3.1 Conversion of coordinates and accuracy

 A conversion between $ and M was carried out for both directions M 4> and

 $ i-> M by means of Eq. (4), and the differences A<t>, = <$,■ — <P(Mj) and AM; =
 Mi — to the given values <t>, and M(- were computed. For M i-» O with s = sm
 Fig. 6 shows the frequencies of differences A<t>, lying within specified intervals (inter

 val width 10'). The distribution has a bell-shaped form with its maximum at ss 0. The

 majority of the absolute values of the differences is not larger than 1/2° •

 As a measure of the consistency between given coordinates >',■ and converted coor

 dinates y(xi) the median absolute deviation

 MAD = med(|>v - y(xj)|) (5)

 (i = 1,... ,n) and the mean deviation

 MD = -V \yi-y(Xi)\ (6)

 1 -

 n i=l

 are used here (Hampel 1974; Sachs 1992, p. 337). Unlike the MD, the MAD is resistent
 against outliers (i.e. abnormally large differences y, — >'(x,) here).

 For both directions of conversion four conversions were carried out with em, s^, s,,

 as well as experimentally with ec. Table 1 shows the MAD, MD, and the number of
 coordinates n. Because of its resistent property the MAD is lower than the MD. In
 most cases value sm leads to the lowest measures of precision; only in the case of
 M h-> <t> the MAD based on eh is 1' (X) and 2' (£2) smaller than the MAD based on

 em. Regarding <t> M as the main direction, the results does not argue against em
 underlying the data.

 A conversion of coordinates and a comparison with given coordinate values was
 also carried out for the M,- of Book 8 and the latitudes of the Canon. For e = em

 the resulting MAD slightly increases in comparison to the location catalogue by 1'
 or 0.1 min, respectively, and the MD increases noticeably by 6' or 0.4 min, respec
 tively (see Table 1). Consequently, the close relation between the M-data of X and the

 latitudes of the Canon stated by Stiickelberger and GraBhoff (2006, p. 44) cannot be

 supported by means of the present computations.

 The size of the differences AO, = <t>; — 0(M,) can be explained by a rough reso
 lution of the M-data and a disadvantageous propagation of their errors (assuming that

 the original direction of conversion was 4) M). Cuntz (1923, p. 104) assumes that
 the original resolution was i/i2h. The largest denominators occurring in £2 among the

 fractions of the M; are 150 (Palura (8.26.6)) and 60 (e.g. Ptolemais Herme (8.15.13),
 Omanon (8.22.12), Saue (8.22.15)); however, they are exceptional values. In X the
 largest denominator is 30. In both £2 and X the denominator 12 occurs often so that
 the main resolution of M-values seems to be i/12 h = 5 min. From fractions like
 n/6 = 2n/12 and n/A = 3n/12 the precision is not known for sure, rougher resolu
 tions than Vi2 h are also possible. For 30° < <t> < 40° Fig. 7 exemplarily shows the
 data points (<t>,, M( ) of Q and X as well as the curve of the trigonometric conversion

 groups have a distance of !/i 2 h so that their resolution is apparently '/12 h (doted lines).
 Also Mi with other resolutions become apparent. The plot shows, too, that equal <J>,

 a = 1/6 h. Regarding only the lines of a = l/6h (solid), no <t>, with different M, occur.

 The error of an M affects the corresponding latitude <t>(A/) according to the value

 of that latitude. In general, the estimated effect of an error Ax in x on the value of the

 function y(x) is

 of O is > 10'. A® increases for M —> 12h to 2/3°. Accordingly, an ancient con
 version O i—> M with a precision of 1/12I1 (or more imprecise) caused a significant
 loss of accuracy in the latitude expressed by M. Even exceptionally high precisions
 as V6°h could have a noticeable effect as the example of Ptolemais Herme shows:
 M — 13 43/60h, Am = 0.5 ■ '/60h, A<j> = 7'. Therefore, a large denominator in the
 fraction of M does not generally mean that the value is given with an unrealistically
 high precision.

 3.2 Distribution of the coordinate differences

 For the coordinate differences AM,- = M, — after the conversion O i-> M

 with s = em it was tested by means of the x2-test of goodness of fit (e.g. Sachs 1992,

 p. 420 ff.) whether they are normally distributed. The test statistic is in general

 k

 1=1

 (8)

 with the class number k, the observed frequencies n, of class (, the hypothetical prob

 abilities pi, and n = X?=i n'- Null hypothesis of the test is the normal distribution
 assumption. Under this hypothesis y1 follows a x2-distribution with / = k — 1 — u

 degrees of freedom, where u is the number of the unknown parameters. The two param

 eters of the normal distribution, the location parameter /z and the scale parameter a,
 were estimated by the arithmetical mean of the AM, and by the root mean square
 deviation (with respect to the mean). A few outlying, very large differences, which are
 not characteristic for the distribution form, were excluded. According to the assumed
 crudest resolution a — l/4h of the M,- (see Sect. 3.4) the limit for |AM, | was set to
 a/2 — 7.5 min (Eq. (3)). The level of significance a used is 5 %. The results are:

 - Q : n = 341, k = 10, / = 7, /z = 0.06min, a = 1.58min,x2 = 26.9;
 - X: n = 216, k = 10, / = 7, At = —0.17min, a = 1.83min,x2 = 27.5.

 The quantile is in both cases q\~a,f = 14.1 so that the normal distribution assump

 tion has to be rejected.

 The x2-test was repeated for the Laplace distribution. Its two parameters ji and a
 were estimated by the median and by the MD (Eq. (6), but here with respect to the
 computed median). The results are:

 - £2 : n = 341, k = 10, / = 7, /z = 0.06min, o = 1.16min,x2 = 12.4;
 - X: n — 216, k = 10, / = 7, = 0.03min, a = 1.35min,x2 = 7.6.

 For £2 and X x 2 goes below the quantile q\-a,f = 14.1. Accordingly it can be assumed
 that the differences AM, follow (at least approximately) a Laplace distribution.

 3.3 On the original direction of conversion

 Ptolemy states in GH 8.2.1 that the M-data are computed from latitudes. However, it

 is known from a few localities that Ptolemy adopted their M-values from Hipparchus

 (Berggren and Jones 2000, p. 29). Hipparchus attributed them to parallels with par
 ticular lengths of the longest day (Meroe (8.16.9), Ptolemais Theron (8.16.10), So
 ene (8.15.15), Rhodos (8.17.21), and Massalia (8.5.7)). From these localities can be
 expected that their latitudes in the location catalogue are derived from M in Book 8.
 Rawlins (1985, 2008) mentions the possibility of a conversion M O for major
 cities; in Rawlins (1985) examples are given. Exemplarily, the localities shall be con
 sidered which Rawlins relates to eh- The contrary conversion M was done by
 means of Eq. (4) with em; the result is shown in Table 2. As can be seen, each computed
 M(<I>) agrees satisfactorily with the value in Book 8. Hence, the coordinates of these

 localities also support the direction of conversion <J> m>- M.

 To provide evidence for the original direction of conversion it was examined how
 satisfactorily the coordinate differences AO, = <t>, — <t> (M,) and A M, = M, —M(<t, )

 after both conversions M h> 4> and <1> t-> M can be explained by the precision of the
 coordinates. Unfortunately, the precision of and M is not constant and not known
 in each case; however, a maximal resolution can be given for the O-values and a main
 resolution for the M-values. Thereby limits La® and Lam for the differences A<J>,
 and AM, can be given so that the numbers of differences was determined, which go
 below these limits.

 For the <t>-values of the poleis episemoi a maximal resolution of 1/2° can be assumed,
 definitely the actual resolution is often more precise (e.g. 1/12° or 1/6° (see Marx
 2011)). According to Eq. (3) the limit La<d is then 0.5 • 1/2° = 1/4°. For the M-values
 a main resolution of 1/12h (or more imprecise; see Sect. 3.1) can be assumed so that
 Lam = 0-5 • 1/12 h = 1/24 h = 2.5 min was used as a limit.

 For both conversions M 4> and <J> i->- M the parameters em and 6|, were used.

 The result is:

 |AM| < Lam;

 |AM| < Lam

 - em : Q. : 69%|AO| < LA<J>, 88 %|AM| < LAjW; X: 66 %\A0>| < LA<j>, 82%

 - eh : £2 : 68%|A4>| < LA<t»87%|AM| < LAM;X: 66%\A<P\ < LAo, 81 %

 The test conditions for the conversions M i->- <J>and4> 1-^ M were not the same, for

 A<t> the limit was advantageously large and for AM small. Nevertheless, the amount
 of AM, going below their limit is noticeably larger than in the case of AO, . Thus,

 the results argue for a main direction of conversion of <t> t-> M. The resulting M; of
 this conversion were round values, whose inaccuracies affect the AO; computed here
 after the back conversion Mt->

 3.4 The obliquity of the ecliptic

 The question of which value e underlies the M-data was investigated more in detail
 chapter by chapter, assuming that the majority of the localities of a chapter were con
 verted with the same value of e. An approach to determine the underlying e is an
 adjustment of e, which also leads to information about the accuracy of the result.
 Solving Eq. (4) for M gives the observation equation of the adjustment model

 Mj + Vi = f (s) = arccos (— tan <1>, tane), i = 1,..., n (9)

 lh

 with the observation M, and its correction Vj. The solution of this non-linear adjust

 ment problem can be obtained iteratively by means of a linearisation (see e.g. Jager et

 al. 2005, p. 116). In Sect. 3.2 the x2-test of goodness of fit showed that the differences

 AM, with respect to a conversion with em follow rather a Laplace distribution than
 a normal distribution. It shall be assumed here that the Laplace distribution can also
 be expected for errors of M, whose conversion is based on e ^ em. The maximum
 likelihood estimation for the Laplace distribution is the Li-norm estimation, which is

 applied here (see e.g. Jager et al. 2005, p. 117 ff.).

 To estimate the accuracy of the adjusted parameter e, the term q = (ATA)-1
 is needed, whose one-column design matrix A of the linearised adjustment problem
 contains the derivatives d/;(e)/de of fi with respect to e. Then the (1 — a)100%
 confidence interval for e can be estimated according to Dielman and Pfaffenberger
 (1982, 1990) by

 e ± As — S ± Za/2^\/q (10)

 , vm+ix ~ vm—v /ii\
 A— - ; • (iij

 4 v/n

 Value m is the index of the median of the computed corrections iin the ordered

 sequence 0/. Values vm+IM and vm~v are the corrections having a distance v from vm
 in the ordered sequence.

 The investigations in Sects. 3.1 and 3.3 show that there are inaccurate M, with larger

 errors, possibly partly corrupt.4 The Li-norm estimation of e and the estimation (10)

 of Ae have the advantage to be resistent against outlying observations.

 4 Examples for corrupt or roughly given Af-values are Nisaia (8.23.6) and Arbis (8.25.14) in Q (Stiickel
 berger and Mittenhuber 2009, pp. 205, 209)

 with the quantile za/2 of the standard normal distribution as well as with

 Geographike Hyphegesis Book 8 545

 Due to their small number of observations (< 3), the chapters Europe 4 and Asia 12
 were excluded from the parameter estimation. X was computed using all v, of the
 remaining chapters, v must to be small but larger than the half of the number u of
 adjustments of e; it was set to 11 + u/2 = 18 for X and to 18 + m/2 = 30 for £25. For
 the confidence interval of e, the probability 95 % was chosen. In summary, the results

 are

 - Q : n = 338, u = 24, X = 0.7', smallest s : 23°46' ± 8' in Europe 10, largest

 s : 24°0r ± 30'in Asia 11;

 - X:n = 217, u — 16, X = 1.0', smalleste : 23°30'±44'in Africa 4 (anomalously
 inaccurate) and 23°45' ± 11' in Europe 10, largest e : 23°56' ± 11' in Europe 9.

 With the exception of Asia 11 in £2 and Africa 4 in X, the adjusted values of e
 deviate from em in the order of some arc minutes (< 10'). Only in the case of Asia 3
 in £2, em lies outside of the estimated 95 %-confidence interval (e = 24°02' ± 9').

 Apart from this exception, the adjustment does not result in significant deviations from
 em, and accordingly the results do not argue against em underlying the M-values in
 general.

 Moreover, em need not be rejected as long as the differences AM, = M, — M(<t>;)

 based on em can be explained by rounding. Exemplarily Asia 3 in Q with the significant

 deviation from em is considered. Each of its ten M, can be explained by a kind of round

 ing as it can be found among the M, of Book 8 (see Sect. 3.5). There are eight M, expli

 cable by a rounding to the nearest 1/12 h. Further, in the case of Thospia, the precision
 could be V24h (M(<t> = 39°50') = 14h53.2m « 142i/24h = 147/8h = M) and in
 the case of Albana Veh (M(<D = 45°50') = 15h36.7m 154/eh = 14 2/3 h = M).
 Apart from that, M of Artemita is not explicable by a conversion with er (which is
 to be expected in view of the adjustment) in conjunction with any kind of rounding
 (M(4> = 40°20') = 14h57.7m, but M = 14h55.0m).

 Finally, all M, were used for an L\ -norm-adjustment of one parameter e. For £2 is

 obtained s = 23°52' ± 2' and for X e = 23°52' ± 3'. Among the different values for
 e introduced here, only em lies within both 95 % confidence intervals.

 3.5 Conversion by means of linear interpolation

 It is much more probable that a conversion of coordinates was originally done by
 means of a tabulation and not by means of a single, trigonometric computation from

 Eq. (4) for each locality. Cuntz (1923, p. 101 ff.) assumes an underlying tabulation
 (Mj, with a step size of 1/12h = 5 min. Using this tabulation, Cuntz cannot
 explain each AZ-value in the examined chapters (8.3-8). An example is Gesoriacum
 (8.5.6) with <J> = 53°30' and M — 16h50m. The nearest <l> in Cuntz's tabulation is
 53°39' which leads to M = 16h55m. Thus, Cuntz supposes that <t> = 53°30' is not
 the original value underlying M.

 ^ In an L \ -norm estimation of « unknown parameters, (at least) u corrections become zero. The choice
 v' = 11 = v — a 12 for X is reconcilable with the values used in Dielman and Pfaffenberger (1990).
 According to the ratio («q — «J2)/("X — Mx) = 1-6, f was set to v — 1.6v' + m/2 = 18 + 12 = 30 for £2.

 computed from the latitude <t> (Eq. (4)), and the Af-data of Book 8 (Q-recension and X-manuscript) as well

 Another approach to explain the M-data in Book 8 is taking recourse to known

 <t>- and M-data given by Ptolemy. There are two datasets with latitudes and corre
 sponding A/-data in the Geography and the MS, these are the compilations of parallels
 in GH 1.23 and MS 2.6. It is conceivable that such data were used in conjunction with

 an interpolation, a method applied by Ptolemy (Pedersen 2011, p. 84). Considering
 the mentioned example of Gesoriacum, M(<t>) computed from Eq. (4) is 16h54m.
 The same result is obtained by means of the compilation of the parallels in GH 1.23
 and a linear interpolation. The slope a of the 17th and 18th parallels in GH 1.23

 The approximated M of Gesoriacum is then

 M = 16h30m + a • (O - 51°30') = 16h54m. (13)

 This value rounded to the nearest 1/6 is 16h50m, the value in the location catalogue.

 As the plot in Fig. 7 shows, a precision of !/6h can be assumed for part of the M-data
 (see Sect. 3.1).

 The accuracy of a linear interpolation of the data in GH 1.23 and MS 2.6 was

 determined by computing the difference AM(<t>) = M(<t>) — M(<t>) between the
 interpolated value M(<t>) and the trigonometric computed value M(<J>) (Eq. (4)).

 interpolated GH- and MS-data are equal6. For <I> < 54°, the interpolation of the MS
 data is very accurate (| AM\ < 0.5 min); for <I> > 54°, the majority of the differences
 A Mi coincide with the curve AM(<t>). This indicates that the M, of Book 8 are based

 on an interpolation of the data in MS 2.6. The interpolation of the GH-data produces
 errors up to 3 min. Its curve AM(<1>) does not coincide with the distribution of the

 differences AM, in general. However, some data points lie next to the curve, and three

 data points coincide with the curve so that an interpolation of the data in GH 1.23 can
 be assumed at least in these cases (£2: Harmuza (8.22.21), Aspithra (8.27.11); Q and
 X.Ambrodax (8.21.17)).

 Finally, the trigonometric computation (e = em) and the linear interpolation
 were compared with regard to the amount of M, explicable by their precision.
 For this purpose, Procedure ROUND was applied (see Sect. 2). As it was shown in
 Sect. 3.1, different resolutions come into consideration. The possible resolutions of
 M were chosen according to the denominators of the fractions occurring in Book 8.
 In addition to the standard resolution as = i/i2h there are in £2 the more precise a
 (in h) '/15, 1/20, 1/24, V30- V60' and '/l^O as well as the less precise l/io, 1/8, 1/6, and

 1/4. The more precise a in X are (in h) 1/15 and 1/30 as well as the less precise 1/8, 1/6,
 and 1/4. The result is given in Table 3. The more precise the resulting resolutions are,
 the more probable the conversion can be considered. The trigonometric conversion
 and the interpolation of the MS-data have nearly the same result; the interpolation of
 the data in GH 1.23 has a worse result than the other two methods. Thus, a conversion

 by means of the data in MS 2.6 is very probable. The amount of A/,- being explainable
 with a resolution of Vl2h is 72 % for £2 and 69 % for X.

 The results in Table 3 show that in the case of £2 84 % and in the case of X 72 % of

 the localities have only small absolute differences < 0.5 • 1/12 h = 1/24 h = 2.5 min

 (cf. Eq. (3)) between A/,- and M(<1>,) converted by means of the data of MS 2.6. Almost
 all Mi (ca. 95 %) can be explained by a conversion (data of MS 2.6 or Eq. (4)) and
 rounding. Hence, the majority of the differences between Book 8 and the location
 catalogue are explicable by the precision of the M-data. Accordingly, both datasets
 show a high level of interdependence.

 6 There are more parallels in MS 2.6 than in GH 1.23 from 45° latitude, but from 54° to 63°, there are
 some interpolated values in MS 2.6 so that a linear interpolation of the data in MS 2.6 and in GH 1.23 leads
 to the same result for latitudes > 54°.

 There is a lower percentage of M, (3 % in Q, 6% in X) differences AM,- of which
 are inexplicable by one of the types of rounding used. These as well as lower precise
 explicable M- values occur in nearly all chapters of Book 8. Possible reasons for M,

 and A/(4>, ) not fitting are

 (1) M is rounded incorrectly7 or is slightly erroneous due to a propagation of round
 ing errors in intermediate results; for example possibly Asturica August (8.4.5)
 with M = 15h25m (in Q. and X) and M(<t>) = 15h22.2m % 15h20m;

 (2) M is wrong due to a corruption; for example possibly Palmyra (8.20.10) in £2

 with M = 14h40m and M(O) = 14h19m ~ 14h20m;

 (3) 4> is wrong due to a corruption; for example Osika (8.19.9) in X with O =
 45°30', M = 15h27.5m, M(<I>) = 15h34m (in contrast ft : <D = 44°45' and
 Canon: $ = 44°30').

 It was tested for the remaining inexplicable M,, whether a conversion with £j, or

 er brings an explanation of their fractions. For this purpose Procedure ROUND was

 repeated. As a result, a few M, can be explained by a rounding, but there still remain
 inexplicable values. However, it is not necessary to assume another value than em; each

 of the problematic M, can be explained by Error 1: Asturica August: see above; Luppia
 (8.6.3): = 16h44m became 16h50m instead of 16h40m (resolution i/6h); Rav
 enna (8.8.5): as Asturica August', Capua (8.8.6): M(<S>) — 15h02m became 15h05m
 instead of 15h00m; Mallos (8.17.44): = 14h32.8m became 14h34m instead
 of 14h32m (resolution i/30h); Medaba (8.20.20): M(4>) = 14h02m became 14h05m
 instead of 14h00m.

 4 Distance from the summer solstice

 At places located between the tropics the sun is at the zenith two (for | <J> | < e) or one

 (for | <J> | = e) times within the year. For this date, the distance S of the sun from the
 summer solstice on the ecliptic is given in Book 8. The quantity I = 90° — S is the
 ecliptic longitude, reckoned from the vernal equinox. There are about 60 localities in
 Book 8 with given S. In MS 1.14, Ptolemy explains the computation of the distance of
 the sun from the equator (declination) by means of Z8. When the sun is at the zenith,

 its declination equals the latitude 4> of the locality. Thus, the calculational relations
 can be used to determine I or S from <t>. The relation between S and the latitude <1> is

 sin <i> = sin e cos S. (14)

 In MS 1.15, Ptolemy gives a list of tabulated <&(/)) for /, = 1°,..., 90° in steps

 of 1° ("Table of Inclination"). A further source of S-data is MS 2.6, where Ptolemy
 arranges data about specific parallels (see Sect. 3.5); however, it includes only 5 data

 pairs (<t>j, Sj). For the parallels with <I> < e S is given there. In the following both

 7 A known inconsistence of this kind, but in latitude, occurs in GH 1.23 in the latitude <t> = 43°05'ofthe 13th

 parallel. Since M of this parallel is lS*1^111, the correct value for <t> should be 43°00' & <t>(M) = 43°01'
 which was given by Ptolemy in MS 2.6.

 ® In MS 1.14, the ecliptic longitude Z is reckoned from the autumnal equinox.

 compilations of S-data in the MS are taken into consideration besides Eq. (14) as a
 possible basis of the 5-data in Book 8 of the Geography.

 4.1 Conversion of coordinates and accuracy

 Firstly, the precision of the S/ is considered to get an idea, which size of coordinate

 differences are to be expected after a conversion between S and 4>. The largest denom
 inator of the fractions of the Si is 6 in Q and 8 in X; the main resolutions seem to

 be 1/3° and 1/4°. Solving Eq. (14) for <J>, the variation A<t of <t> due to an error A5

 in S can be estimated by Eq. (7). The computation of propagation of errors was done

 exemplarily for the resolutions 1/6° and 1/20. The variations were set to the expected
 maximal rounding errors (Eq. (3)): As = 0.5 • 1/6° = V12° and Aty = 0.5 • i/2° = '/4°

 Figure 8 shows the result. The effect of a variation in S on 4> is very low (in comparison

 to M and <t>). For an inaccurate resolution of 1/2° the expected maximal error in <t>

 increases only to 6'; it goes to zero for S —> 0 (i.e. <t> —*■ e).

 The conversion between S and <t> was carried out for both directions S i-> <t> and

 4> h* S by means of Eq. (14) with the four different e introduced in Sect. 3, and the

 differences AO,- = <J>, — 4>(S,) and A.S', = St — 5(4>,-) to the given values <t>, and
 Si were computed. Since X ends in GH 5.13, only 16 5-values can be considered for
 the comparison of Book 8 and the location catalogue (these are Syene (8.15.15) and
 Chapter 16 (Asia 4)). From the differences between the converted and the original
 coordinates, the MAD and the MD were computed by Eqs. (5) and (6); the results are
 given in Table 1.9

 In the case of X, the MAD = 2' for $ 5(em) is very small and goes below the
 expected result with regard to the assumed main precisions of 1/30 and 1/40. In contrast,

 the MD = 31' is considerably larger. It is increased by four large differences.10 The

 MAD for e 7^ em is significantly larger than for em; that argues for em underlying the
 S'-data of X.

 Stiickelberger and GraBhoff (2006, p. 44) mention that the .S'-data of X are consid

 erably more precise than the .S'-data of Q. Using a conversion based on Eq. (14), this
 can be confirmed. In the case of £2, the MAD for O t-> 5(em) is 72'. There are many
 differences A Si >1° which cannot be explained by the resolution of the S,. A wrong
 value for s underlying the reconversion can be excluded; the other (eligible) values do

 not lead to considerably smaller coordinate differences. Thus, either corrupt data must

 be assumed for £2 or that the conversion done here is wrong. Regarding the known

 sources of .S'-data, the tabulation in MS 1.15 has a step size of 10 for /, and Ptolemy's
 Handy Tables include a similar tabulation with a step size of 3° (Neugebauer 1975,
 p. 979). Thus, the usage of these tabulations (without interpolation) would result in
 •S-values with fractions equal to zero. That does not hold for the data in Book 8. In

 9 In the case of <t> i-* S(ec), the number n of the converted latitudes is smaller because values <i> > sc can

 not be converted by Eq. (14). Arbis (8.25.14) is excluded from the computations because of its exceptionally
 wrong S = 0° in Q.

 10 These localities are Syene (8.15.15) andAutolalai (8.16.3) with the crude value S = 0° for<t = 23°50'
 as well as Dere (8.16.12) and Mosylon (8.16.13).

 Fig. 10 Differences AS = S — S(<J>) between the distances S(<t>) from the summer solstice, trigonomet
 rically computed from the latitude <J> (Eq. (14)), and the S-data of Book 8 (£2-recension and X-manuscript)
 as well as S resulting from an linear interpolation of the S-data of MS 1.15, MS 2.6, and Handy Tables
 (AS « 0 for MS 1.15 and Handy Tables)

 Fig. 10, the differences A5,- = Si — S(4>i) are plotted against the latitude." The plot
 indicates a dependence between AS and <t> of £2; regionally AS increases or decreases

 with increasing <t>. This suggests that the S-data in £2 are not determined by means of
 the conversion (14).

 Table 1 also gives the MAD and the MD for the differences A<J>, and A Si computed
 from the <t>,- and converted S(<t>i) of the Canon. In the case of Q the results do not

 change significantly in comparison to the location catalogue of the Geography. In the

 case of X, the Canon enables a comparison for all S-data (in contrast to the incomplete
 location catalogue of X). Using the Canon, the small MAD = 3.5' for <I> h-> S(em)
 confirms the high accuracy of the S-data which has already been observed for the
 small sample size of the location catalogue. The large MD of 50' shows, as in case of
 the location catalogue, that there are also some latitudes which do not agree with the
 respective S.

 Due to the incomplete location catalogue of X the missing latitudes were experi
 mentally substituted by the values of £2 as well as of the Canon to compute the 5(0,).
 In the case of Q, there are eight localities more than in the case of the Canon with
 large differences | A5"; | > 1°.12 Figure 10 shows the AS, based on the latitudes of
 the Canon. In the case of X there is no comparable dependence between AS and <t>
 as detected for £2. Most of the differences are near zero. Consequently, the coordinate
 differences of X reveal a close connection between its S-data and the latitudes of the

 Canon.

 Furthermore, Fig. 10 shows the curves of the differences AS(<t>) = S(<t>) — S(<t>)
 between the trigonometrically computed S(4>) (Eq. (14)) and the value S(O) deter
 mined by linear interpolations: (1) of the tabulation in MS 1.15, (2) of the tabulation in

 '' Arbis (8.25.14) with very large |AS| is excluded in the case of £2.

 12 Localities with |AS| > 1° occurring in £2 but not in the Canon are: Kane (8.22.9), Gerra (8.22.10), Sapp
 hara (8.22.16), Chaberis (8.26.5), Palura (8.26.6), Patala (8.26.10), Barbarei (8.26.11), Tosalei (8.27.5),

 the Handy Tables,13 and (3) of the data of the parallels in MS 2.6. The interpolations
 of the data in MS 1.15 and the Handy Tables lead to accurate results (| A5| < 2.3' and
 | A5| < 0.5°, respectively). Their error curves run close to zero so that they coincide
 with the majority of the differences A5/ occurring in X. Consequently, a conversion
 by means of one of both tabulations can be assumed for the predominant amount of
 accurate Sj in X. Because of the small number of data pairs Sj) in MS 2.6, the
 interpolation of these data is significantly erroneous, especially for <t> > 20°. How
 ever, the curve AS fits the differences A5, of some localities in 12 for (fr > 16° well.

 This reveals the possibility of another type of interpolation underlying the data of Q,
 see Sect. 4.2.

 For the S-data of X and the auxiliary latitudes of the Canon, Procedure ROUND
 (see Sect. 2) was applied to explain as many S1, as possible by rounding. Because of
 the small MAD, the standard resolution was set to as = V8° = 7.5'. The less pre
 cise resolutions are a = 1/6°, |/4°, 1/3°, 1/2°, and 1°. As a result 42 of 59 S, can be
 explained by a rounding: a = as: 15, a = 1/6°: 20, a — 1 /4°: 3, a = 1/2°: 3, and
 a — 1°: 1. Among the remaining 17 S, there are 5 with the obviously approximative

 value S = 0°.14 Furthermore, two 5,- can be explained by a linear interpolation of the
 data in MS 2.6, the concerning localities are Argyre (8.27.10) and Kattigara (8.27.13).
 Their <J> is 8°30', the interpolated S is 68°49', that is ~ 68 3/4°, the S in Book 8. The
 remaining 10 problematic S) probably have corruptions; for example, Dere (8.16.12)
 has O = 11 °()()' and S — 623/4°, but the converted value is S(0) = 61°51' ~ 613/4°

 so that an error of 1 ° in S is possible.

 4.2 Linearly converted data in £2

 A few localities in Book 8 of £2 have accurate S-values with | A.S'| < 15', they are Geira
 (8.16.6), Garama (8.16.7), Napata (8.16.8), Muza (8.22.6), Karminna (8.22.23), and
 Barbarei (8.26.11). The localities Syene (8.15.15), Berenike (8.15.19) and Autolalai
 (8.16.3) have d> = 23°50' and the approximative S = 0°. Arbis (8.25.14) has the
 erroneous S = 0°. The S-values of most of the other localities can be explained by a

 conversion of <t> by means of a piecewise linear function. The data reveal three regions
 for which a linear conversion was done separately. These regions cannot be made out

 well in the plot of the differences A Si in Fig. 10 but by means of a plot of S against
 <t>, see Fig. 11. Obviously, the limits between the three regions are <J> 12 ^ 12°30'
 and <I>23 20° 15'; they correspond to a division of the quadrant of the ecliptic into
 three equal parts with the range of ~ 30°. Hence, the piecewise linear function of
 conversion is

 S'(4>) =

 S\ (O) = a\<t> + b\ for 0° < <t> < O12
 S'2(®) — Cl2$> + b2 for <t>|2 < O < 023 (15)
 5^(<j>) = a3c|) + £3 for <J>23 < O < e.

 13 The tabulation of the Handy Tables is represented here by the data of the table in MS 1.15. To obtain a

 step size of 3° for / each third row was used.

 14 These localities areSyene (8.15.15), Autolalai (8.16.3), Gerra (8.22.10), Harmuza (8.22.21), and Tosalei
 (8.27.5).

 the location catalogue, trigonometric conversion function 5(<t>) (derived from Eq. (14)), linear conversion
 functions , S^, and S^ (Eq. (15))

 To define a linear functions two points are necessary. Two points (<t>, S) are known:
 (0°, 90°)and(e, 0°). Moreover, very probably Radeo (8.22.4) with Or = 20° 15' and

 .SB = 30° was used as end point of S[ (O) and starting point of S'2(O) as well as Pityn
 dra (8.26.19) with Op = 12°30' and Sp = 60° was used as end point of ^(O) and
 starting point of ^(O). Sb and Sp are inaccurate, but conspicuously round values,
 possibly intensionally approximative to simplify the computations.15 It is obtained
 with (0°, 90°) and Pityndra:

 a\ =(5p-90°)/(Op-0°)%-2.4 (16)

 b\ — 90° — a\ 0° = 90°. (17)

 It is obtained with Badeo and Pityndra:

 a2 = (SB - Sp)/(<t>B - fp) 88 -3-9 (18)
 b2 = 5b - a2 ■ Ob = 108°58' « 109°. (19)

 It is obtained with Badeo and (e, 0°):

 above).

 S'(O) is plotted in Fig. 11 together with the given data points (O;, Si) and the
 trigonometric conversion function S(O) based on Eq. (14). S' fits the inaccurate

 data points very well. Especially S3 is a bad approximation for the trigonometric

 from Eq. (14) is S(<t>) = 31°09'.

 function S(<3>) based on Eq. (14). In Table 4 Si, the computed S'fO,) as well as
 the remaining difference AS- = St — £'(<!>,) are given for the 47 localities which

 have not been discussed so far. The differences A S[ are explicable in almost every
 case by a reasonable rounding to the nearest 1°, 1/2°, 1/3°, or 1/4°. There remain
 10 localities whose S'(<t>) cannot be rounded to the given S in this way. The rea
 son could be peculiar roundings or scribal errors, also in an originally trigonomet
 ric converted S. For example, a linear conversion and a confusion of !/3 = y and
 2/3 — yo can be assumed for Barygaza (S"(<I>) = 41°24' 411/3° ^ 41 2/3° = S)
 as well as for Maagrammon. A trigonometric conversion and a scribal error can be
 assumed for Iazeitha, which has S = 47°40' in £2 and the accurate value 48°40' in
 X.

 Appendix: Changes to and errors in the data source

 The following changes of coordinates values underlie the present investigations.
 Changes of known inconsistent values are: <J> of Autolalai (4.6.24) in X was changed
 from 27°20' to 23°50' (as Q and Canon). Argyre (8.27.10) and Kattigara (8.27.13)
 were positioned on the northern hemisphere instead of the southern one. (The pos
 itive latitudes equal the more plausible values in the Canon. On the negative lati
 tudes of Chinese places see also Rawlins 2008, p. 47.) Further changes are: Pal
 myra (8.20.10): M = 14h40m (also Nobbe 1843-1845) to M = 14h20m (Rawlins
 2009) and Apameia (8.20.9): A = i/8h to A = 5/8h (Nobbe 1843-1845; Rawlins
 2009).

 As a support for further investigations of the coordinates of Book 8, the errors
 shall be given here, which were found in the data base of Stuckelberger and GraBhoff
 (2006). Data which are correct in the printout but erroneous in the database are given
 in Table 5.
