 Abstract In the early 1930s W. O. Kermack and W. H. McCrea published three
 papers in which they attempted to prove a result of E. T. Whittaker on the solution of

 differential equations. In modern parlance, their key idea consisted in using quantized

 contact transformations over an algebra of differential operators. Although their papers

 do not seem to have had any impact, either then or at any later time, the same ideas

 were independently developed in the 1960-1980s in the framework of the theory of

 modules over rings of microdifferential operators. In this paper we describe the results

 of Kermack and McCrea and discuss possible reasons why such promising papers had

 no impact on the mathematics of the twentieth century.

 1 Introduction

 Amongst the ideas that made a deep impact on mathematics in the 1980s and 1990s

 we can certainly count the twin theories of differential and microdifferential oper-
 ators, jointly known as algebraic analysis. Their impact extended far and wide,
 and spread through such areas as partial differential equations, representations of

 algebraic groups, noncommutative ring theory, and combinatorics. Nor has their
 influence waned, as a search of MathSciNet clearly shows.

 The genesis of both theories is usually traced to the 1960s, when modules over

 rings of differential operators were first systematically studied by M. Sato in Japan

 and, independently, by J. Bernstein in the Soviet Union. These ideas were then devel-

 oped systematically by Sato, Bernstein, M. Kashiwara, Z. Mebhkout and many other

 mathematicians. For more details see Sect. 9.2. However, 30 years earlier some of the
 ideas that we now associate with algebraic analysis had already been introduced in
 four papers of W. O. Kermack and W. H. McCrea. Published between 1931 and 1933,

 the papers were motivated by a 'research lecture' given by Sir Edmund Whittaker in
 Edinburgh. In this lecture, whose content appeared in Whittaker (1931), Whittaker

 proposed a theorem on the transformation of definite integrals which he used to solve

 various differential equations. It turned out, however, that Whittaker's proof of this
 theorem was, in his own words, 'defective'.

 Whittaker's audience included the chemist W. O. Kermack and the physicist W. H.

 McCrea. In McCrea's words (Davidson 1971, p. 421)

 Kermack saw immediately that Whittaker's ideas required in the first place an

 algebra of operators of a novel sort. Within a day or two he sketched his thoughts

 to me and we proceeded together to develop them in four papers published soon
 afterwards.

 This 'novel algebra of operators' turned out to be analogous to the algebra gener-
 ated by the operators position and momentum in quantum mechanics, which had
 been introduced by Dirac in 1926 (see Dirac 1926a; also in van der Waerden 1967, pp.
 307-320). This is a noncommutative algebra, for which they introduced 'contact trans-

 formations' like the ones used in Hamiltonian dynamics (Whittaker 1999, p. 288ff).

 These transformations allowed them to prove Whittaker's theorem.

 In this paper we recount the history of the work on differential operators by

 Kermack and McCrea and relate it to modern work on rings of differential opera-

 tors. Section 2 contains short biographies of the three main characters of our story:
 Whittaker, Kermack and McCrea. These do not cover in detail the whole life of each

 of these scientists, but only take the story up to the time when the work discussed here
 was done. In Sect. 3 we review the basics of contact transformations, both the 1930s

 approach as expounded in Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics (Whittaker 1999), and its
 modern presentation. The analysis of the work of Whittaker, Kermack and McCrea

 on differential equations begins in Sect. 4, with a description of Whittaker's seminar

 in Edinburgh, where his results on integration were first presented to an audience that
 included both Kermack and McCrea. The next sections contain a presentation of six

 different papers. The first, by Whittaker, states his integration theorem and gives sev-

 eral examples; this is followed by two substantial papers, jointly written by Kermack

 and McCrea, which give their proof of Whittaker's theorem, based on noncommutative

 algebra. Of the last three papers, two develop some collateral themes, whilst the very
 last one (written by McCrea alone) is an exposition of their method aimed at a more

 general audience. In the final section we analyse some of the weak points of the theory
 introduced by Kermack and McCrea, explain how they anticipated some key ideas of
 modern algebraic analysis, and discuss the possibility of this being a case of missed

 opportunity, in the terminology of Dyson (1972). This section ends with a general

 conclusion which summarizes the main points of the article. To simplify cross-ref-

 erencing, equations will be numbered sequentially throughout the paper, even when

 they are part of a quotation from a primary source.

 2 Dramatis personae

 In this section we give biographical data on the three main characters of our story,

 beginning with the oldest and best known of the three.

 2.1 E. T. Whittaker

 Edmund Taylor Whittaker was born on 24 October 1873 in Southport. Whittaker was

 not very strong as a child, and his mother took care of his early education. It was only

 when he was 1 1 years old that he entered Manchester Grammar School, where he was

 on the classical side, with more than three-fifths of his time taken up with Latin and

 Greek. Whilst the study was purely linguistic, he did very well; however, his lack of

 interest in poetry and drama led to a falling-off in the upper forms. In order to escape

 that he elected to specialize in mathematics.

 In December, 1891 Whittaker obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge,

 and in 1895 graduated as second wrangler, being beaten to the first place by T. J. l'A.

 Bromwich. The next year he was elected a Fellow of Trinity and was put on the staff.

 Although Whittaker's early interests where in applied mathematics, the work for which
 he was awarded the First Smith Prize in 1897 dealt with uniform functions, a theme

 of pure mathematics.

 Amongst the courses he taught in Cambridge was the one on complex function the-

 ory which would later become the basis for Whittaker's first book A Course of Modern

 Analysis (Watson and Whittaker 1963). Although the book is often called 'Whittaker

 and Watson', the first edition, published in 1902, was a solo effort (see Barrow-Green

 2002). Watson's collaboration began with the second edition, which appeared in 1915,

 and it is thanks to him that this edition included topics like Riemann integration and

 the zeta function. Beside Watson himself, many well-known mathematicians attended

 Whittaker's Cambridge lectures, amongst them G. H. Hardy, J. E. Littlewood and
 H. W. Turnbull, as well as the astronomers J. H. Jeans and A. S. Eddington.

 Whittaker remained in Cambridge until 1906, when he moved to Dublin to take the

 post of Royal Astronomer for Ireland. At the same time he was appointed professor

 of astronomy at the University of Dublin. By this time he had already been elected a

 fellow of the Royal Society. Despite the title of his chair, Whittaker recognized that he

 was more of a mathematician than an astronomer, his talents being in the line of devel-
 oping the sort of mathematics that would be useful to astronomers (Barrow-Green

 2002). In 1912, Whittaker moved to the University of Edinburgh where he had been

 elected professor of mathematics and he stayed there for the next 35 years, by which

 time he had established a research school and founded (in 1914) what may have been

 the first university mathematical laboratory.

 Whittaker was awarded many prizes, amongst them the Sylvester Medal (193 1) and

 the Copley Medal (1956) by the Royal Society and he served as president of both the
 Edinburgh Mathematical Society (1939-1944) and the London Mathematical Society
 (1928-1929). He died on 24 March 1956. For more details see McCrea (1957) and
 Temple (1956).

 2.2 W. O. Kermack

 Of the three main characters in our story, Kermack is surely the least known

 amongst mathematicians; and this is not at all surprising, for he was an experimental
 chemist.

 William Ogilvy Kermack was born on 26 April 1898 in Kirriemuir, Scotland, the

 birthplace of J. M. Barrie. Actually, Barrie's first novels are based on stories that his
 mother told him about Kirriemuir, which is called Trums' in the novels.

 On the death of his mother in 1904, Kermack was brought up by his father's sis-

 ter. At the age of five he entered Webster's Seminary, a local school that provided

 primary and secondary education. At this school he was introduced to mathematics,

 mainly by the headmaster Thomas Pullar, who took him as far as coordinate geometry
 and conies, as well as topics of mixed mathematics like elementary dynamics and

 hydrostatics.

 Kermack entered Aberdeen University in 1914 where he graduated M.A. 4 years
 later, with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, and B.Sc. with

 special Distinction in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, having been
 awarded several prizes. He was taught mathematics at Aberdeen by J. H. Grace, who

 did a great deal to stimulate his interest in it.

 After a few years at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory in Oxford, Kermack was
 appointed in charge of the Chemical Section of the Royal College of Physicians Labo-

 ratory in Edinburgh. This was in 1 92 1 . Three years later, tragedy struck. Whilst he was
 alone at the laboratory, the preparation on which he was working exploded, driving

 caustic substances into his eyes and rendering him totally blind for life. Although he

 was only 26 at the time, Kermack was not put down by his blindness. Instead, he

 re-organised his life to meet his new needs, in which he was helped by friends and col-

 leagues; with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Carnegie
 Trust providing funds for a special assistant.

 Kermack would remain in Edinburgh until 1949, when he moved to Aberdeen to
 take the MacLeod-Smith Chair of Biological Chemistry, from which he retired in

 1968. He died suddenly, 2 years later, whilst working at his desk. Most of Kermack's

 work is in the area of biochemistry. However, he kept his interest in mathematics and

 was an active member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society during his stay in that

 city. Besides the work on differential equations that we will discuss here, Kermack's
 mathematical papers dealt also with Riemannian geometry, relativistic cosmology and
 statistics. Kermack was elected to the Royal Society in 1944. His obituary in the Bio-

 graphical Memoirs (Davidson 1971) provides an extensive bibliography, as well as a
 detailed account of his chemical work.

 2.3 W. H. McCrea

 Although he is best known as an astronomer, Sir William Hunter McCrea held posi-
 tions in mathematics departments for many years. Born in Dublin in 1904, McCrea

 was brought up in Derbyshire, after his family moved to England when he was 2 years
 old. He attended Chesterfield Grammar School and won an Entrance Scholarship to
 Trinity College Cambridge in 1923. Whilst working for the Mathematical Tripos, he
 found time to obtain a first class B.Sc. with honours in mathematics from London

 University. McCrea graduated from Cambridge in 1926, and immediately began to

 work for a Ph.D. there under the supervision of R. H. Fowler. In 1928 he won a Rouse

 Ball Traveling Studentship that took him to Göttingen for the year 1928-1929.

 Back from Göttingen, McCrea took his first teaching position in 1930 as Lecturer

 in Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. He spent 2 years in Edinburgh, during
 which the work that we report in this paper was undertaken. In 1932 he moved to
 Imperial College, London, as Reader in Mathematics, where he stayed until 1936,
 then moving to a Chair of Mathematics at Queen's University in Belfast. During the
 war McCrea worked at the Operational Research Group, after which he took over as
 Professor and Head at the Mathematics Department, Royal Holloway College. It was
 only in 1966 that he had his first post in Astronomy, as founding Research Professor

 in the Astronomy Centre of the recently opened University of Sussex.

 McCrea published some 280 scientific papers and six books. Although many of his

 early papers are on topics of physics and mathematics, his interests gradually focused
 on the application of theoretical physics to astronomy. Indeed, he is probably best

 known for his work on stellar atmospheres, relativity and cosmology.

 McCrea was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1929, served

 as President between 1961 and 1963 and was awarded its Gold Medal in 1976. He

 was elected to a Fellowship of the Royal Society of London in 1952.

 3 Contact transformations

 As we saw at the introduction, the work of Kermack and McCrea on the application of

 rings of differential operators was prompted by Whittaker's idea of using contact trans-

 formations in order to solve differential equations. Actually, Whittaker's interest in

 these transformations predates this paper by many years, as we shall see in this section,

 where we also introduce the basic facts of the theory of contact transformations.

 3.1 Whittaker's 'Analytical Dynamics'

 As we saw in Sect. 2.1, Whittaker lectured in Cambridge between 1896 and 1906. At

 this time he wrote several books, the best known of which is probably his very first
 book Modern Analysis, which has already been mentioned in Sect. 2. 1 . Another book

 written at this time, and published in 1904, had the long title A treatise on the analytical

 dynamics of particles and rigid bodies, with an introduction to the problem of three

 bodies', nowadays it is known simply as Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics. Although
 mainly based on the notes of his Cambridge lectures, it also included material from

 the Report on the progress of the solution of the problem of three bodies, which he

 had prepared for the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1899. At

 the time it appeared, Analytical Dynamics was, according to Martin (1958),

 the first systematic account to be given in English of general dynamical theory,

 i.e. the superbly beautiful theory which springs from Hamilton's equations and

 which has turned out to be of such fundamental importance for the development

 of quantum mechanics.

 In its more than 450 pages, Analytical Dynamics ranges from the more elementary

 concepts of kinematics and dynamics, through specific problems that are completely

 soluble, to Hamiltonian dynamics and celestial mechanics. The chapters that will con-
 cern us here are those that deal with Hamiltonian mechanics, specially what he calls
 the 'transformation theory of dynamics'. This chapter played a decisive rôle in the

 history of modern physics by inspiring Dirac's approach to quantum mechanics (see
 Kragh 1990, p. 17).

 3.2 Contact transformations

 Let us begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of Hamiltonian mechanics in the

 terminology of Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics (see Whittaker 1931, Sect. 109, pp.
 263-265).

 Consider a conservative time-independent (holonomic) dynamical system with

 coordinate functions q', ...,qn and let L(q' , . . . , qn, q' , . . . , qn) be its kinetic poten-

 tial. Writing the equations of motion in Lagrangian form we obtain,

 where, as usual, the dot over a letter denotes the time derivative of the corresponding

 function. Using 8 for the increment of a function with respect to a small change of its

 Denoting by H the quantity L - Xr=i Pr4r, and equating terms on 8qr and 8pr on
 both sides of (3.1) we find that

 -2- =

 -2- dqr dH -£- dpr dH
 dí 3/?r dř dqr

 In present day terminology, H is the Hamiltonian function and (3.2) the Hamiltonian

 equations of the given system. Thus, in this framework, the equations of the system

 are described in terms of In variables, the n position variables q' , . . . , qn and the n

 conjugate momentum variables p' , . . . , pn.

 Suppose now that we have two sets of 2n variables, denoted by

 (qi,...,qn,Pi,-..,Pn) and (ßi, . . . , ß„, ßi, . . . , ß„),

 the second of which is defined in terms of the first. In other words, each ß and P is

 a function of the qs and ps. The change of variables from the capitalised variables
 to the noncapitalised ones defined by the formulae for the ßs and Ps is a contact

 transformation if the differential form

 n

 ^PrdQr-pràqr,

 when written in terms of the #s and ps is the differential of a function

 W = W(q',...,qn,pi,...,Pn).

 Take, for instance,

 ß = (2#)1/2ekcos(/?) and P = (2^)1/2e"ksin(/7); (3.3)

 see Whittaker (1931, Example 1, p. 293). Since

 Pdß = (-(2^)-1/2 cos(p)) dq - (i2qÝ'2 sin(p)) dp

 we have that Pdß - pdq = dW for W = q sin(p) cos(p) - qp. Hence the formula
 (3.3) defines a contact transformation. This article of Analytical Dynamics ends with

 an argument purporting to prove that if the sets of variables q and ß are independent,

 then there exists a function W' (q' , . . . , qn, Q' , . . . , Qn), such that

 Pr = - dQr i and Pr = -1-1. dqr (3.4)

 The function W' is called a generating function of the corresponding contact transfor-

 mation. For a more accurate discussion of these functions see Arnold (1989, p. 258ff).
 In Sect. 131 of Analytical Dynamics the conditions under which the Ps and ßs as

 functions of q' , . . . , qn, p' , . . . , pn define a contact transformation are expressed in

 terms of the Poisson bracket. If u and v are functions of these same variables, then
 their Poisson bracket is

 A /du dv du dv'

 f^x'dqrdpr dprdqrj'

 Although Whittaker writes (w, v) for this bracket, we will use the modern notation
 {«, v] instead. The main theorem of Sect. 131 is stated as follows:

 Now let (gi , . . . , gn, P' , . . . , Pn) denote In functions of In variables (<?i , . . . ,

 qn, p' , . . . , pn)' we shew that the conditions which must be satisfied in order
 that the transformation from one set of variables to the other may be a contact

 transformation may be written in the form

 [Pi,Pj} = 0, {Qi,Qj} = 0 (1,7 = 1,2,...,*),
 {Qi,Pj} = 0 (i'7 = l,2,. ..,n;i9fc 7),
 [Qi,Pi) = l (i,7 = l,2,.. .,n)

 Although Whittaker goes a lot deeper in his investigation of transformation theory,
 this is essentially all we need from Analytical Dynamics. However, before we move

 on, it is convenient to present this material under more modern garb, since it will

 reappear in this form when we come to relate the work of Kermack and McCrea to
 modern algebraic analysis.

 3.3 Symplectic geometry

 Although its roots can be found in the work of Lagrange, Poisson, Hamilton and
 Jacobi, symplectic geometry only took hold as the proper geometrical framework for

 conservative dynamical systems in the twentieth century.

 Let q' , . . . , qn, p' , . . . pn be coordinates in a real In -dimensional space R2n. The

 standard symplectic structure of such a space is defined by the closed 2-form

 Çl = ^àqr Aápr =á'y'tqr Aàpr 1,

 where A denotes the exterior product of differential forms. Let gi, . . . , Qn and
 Pi, . . . , Pn be another set of coordinates of R2n and assume that T : R2n -> R2n

 is a map that transforms the P, g coordinates into the p, q coordinates. In this termi-

 nology, T is a contact transformation (or canonical) if

 Nowadays these transformations are more often called symplectomorphisms. It follows
 from (3.5) that

 is a closed 1-form, so it must be written as the differential of some function W, just
 as in Whittaker's definition. We can also easily define the Poisson bracket of two

 functions / and g on R2" by the formula

 {f,g} = Q(df,dg).

 4 Differential equations

 We are lucky in having Sir William McCrea's personal testimony on his work with
 Kermack, which appeared at the end of Davidson (1971).

 4.1 The 'research lectures'

 As part of his effort to create a research school at Edinburgh, Whittaker gave 'research
 lectures' on two afternoons a week on themes that interested him at the moment. On

 his obituary of Whittaker, McCrea (1957, p. 239) writes

 The most famous of the department's activities were his 'research lectures' to

 staff, postgraduate students and visitors. He gave them twice a week in the mid-

 dle of the afternoon, throughout the academic year. Either he discussed his own

 current work or he gave his own development of topics of current interest in

 mathematics. One marvels at the mathematical power that enabled him always,

 year after year, to have material for these lectures - he never repeated the same

 ones - just as though he had nothing else to think about, when actually he was
 inundated with other duties. He had everything fully written out in his notes,

 which he kept tidy by a method of his own depending upon much use of scissors

 and paste. As he delivered the lecture, he wrote the whole of it on the blackboard

 as fast as he spoke. Apparently all his lectures to students were given in this
 style.

 In his obituary of Whittaker for the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, Martin (1958)
 adds a few more details to McCrea's description

 For instance, when Einstein first produced a unified field theory the lectures
 dealt with that theory whilst a course on spinors followed the publication by
 Cartan of his important book on the subject. Whittaker's ability to absorb and
 digest so much fresh mathematical work and to lecture on it term after term was

 truly remarkable. For it must be emphasized that his lecture notes were not just

 verbatim copies of the essential parts of the published papers on the subject, but
 contained what was almost a redevelopment of the subject by himself.

 674 S. C. Coutinho

 And, after commenting, as does McCrea, on the fact that Whittaker wrote his whole
 talk on the blackboard, Martin adds

 At the end of a lecture he may have been physically tired but he was certainly

 mentally exhilarated. The research room in the Mathematical Institute is a small

 homely lecture room with a fire-place at the back, and a few minutes before the

 end of Whittaker's lecture someone in the back row would put the kettle on the

 fire so that by four o'clock tea would be ready. Whittaker would then relax in

 his armchair by the fire, serenely happy with his colleagues and visitors around

 him, whilst the animated discussion which arose would cover anything from the

 lecture just given to academic affairs or religion. In this atmosphere Whittaker

 was in a most exhilarating form and the inspiration seemed to flow from him.

 Indeed, as far as research work is concerned, it is rather for his power of inspiring

 others than for his own work that he will long be remembered.

 It was at one of these lectures that he introduced the generalisation of Laplace's trans-

 form that led Kermack and McCrea to their work on differential operators.

 4.2 Edinburgh, autumn of 1930

 We now turn to McCrea's description of his joint work with Kermack, which originated
 in one of Whittaker's 'research lectures' at Edinburgh. According to him, Kermack

 often came to these lectures, even though they were aimed mainly at mathematicians.

 Here is what he says at the end of Kermack's obituary (Davidson 1 97 1 , pp. 420-422):

 In one of these lectures in the autumn of 1930, Whittaker propounded a remark-

 able theorem on the solution of differential equations by definite integrals.

 Roughly stated, it dealt with the type of relation

 Ý(q)=Jx(q,Q)<KQ)dQ (4.1)

 where V and 0 are solutions of linear differential equations related through a
 contact transformation, x is a solution of a pair of partial differential equations
 derived from the same contact transformation, and the path of integration has

 to be suitably chosen. The theorem may be regarded as a greatly generalised

 Laplace transformation, and it covers all the well-known integral relations in the

 theory of special functions. It was a brilliant conjecture of Whittaker's, but for

 his part he contented himself with a number of interesting illustrations. He did

 not attempt to formulate a general statement nor to give a proof.

 McCrea's comments should be compared with Whittaker's. In the paper Whittaker

 (1931) where he announces this 'brilliant conjecture', Whittaker says:

 My own original way of establishing the theorem was defective as a proof, and
 has been superseded by a proof devised by Dr Kermack and Dr M 'Crea [sic],
 which is given in the paper following this.

 Whittaker on contact transformations 675

 So it seems that Whittaker originally had a proof, which turned out to be wrong; and

 that's why the result he presented ended up as no more than a conjecture.

 McCrea goes on to explain how the collaboration with Kermack came about:

 Kermack saw immediately that Whittaker's ideas required in the first place an
 algebra of operators of a novel sort. Within a day or two he sketched out his

 thoughts to me and we proceeded together to develop them in four papers pub-
 lished soon afterwards.

 The papers are Kermack and McCrea (1931a,b,c, 1933), the first two of which we
 discuss in detail in Sects. 6 and 7. Next, McCrea explains the contents of each one of

 the papers:

 The first requirement of a theory was to show how to derive the equations for the

 function x in a manner that is unambiguous and that makes them compatible.

 This was the main point of the first paper. We proceeded to give definite rules

 for passing from the differential equation for (/> to that for '¡r, and vice versa.
 We then showed how to generalise the equations for x- If (4.1) be regarded
 as a transformation from </> to y, we also obtained some results on successive
 transformations of this sort.

 In our second paper we began by giving a number of theorems in the algebra of
 a pair of operators p, q that commute according to qp - pq = 1 and otherwise
 obey the usual laws of algebra. Probably most of these are now familiar in the

 literature, but at the time they were new and somewhat surprising. Kermack fore-

 saw the forms of some of the most complicated results, doing all the working in

 his head; he had an altogether exceptional sense of algebraic form, in addition to
 his penetrating sense of mathematical significance. Functions p(q, p),cr(q, p)
 such that pa - op = 1 we called conjugate and the transformation from q, p
 to p, o we called canonical. We were then able to reformulate the work on

 differential equations in terms of these concepts.

 It should perhaps be recalled that by this time Kermack had been blind for 5 years. At

 the very beginning of his comments, McCrea says

 I understand that when [Kermack] was in hospital after the accident, as soon as

 he knew he would not see again, he got friends and nurses to read fairly ele-
 mentary mathematics to him, so that he could train himself to take mathematics

 in this way and then to think about it for himself. It was incredible to find how

 much he could do without being able to put anything down on paper.

 Kermack's feats are indeed quite remarkable, as anyone who has had to compute
 with noncommuting differential operators will surely appreciate. As to Kermack and
 McCrea (1931c, 1933), here is what McCrea had to say about them:

 In the third paper we showed that in Whittaker's original theorem it is possible to

 replace the definite integral by a certain differential operator. Perhaps, not unnat-

 urally, this could be thought of as a generalisation of Maclaurin's theorem. We

 showed that it gave as a particular case R. A. Fisher's rule for the transformation

 of the moment-generating function in probability theory.

 The fourth paper is one with the most general mathematical appeal. It is, of
 course, well known that the eigen-solutions of an equation of hypergeometric

 type form a set of functions orthogonal to the eigen-solutions of the adjoint dif-

 ferential equation. It is also well known that such functions satisfy a difference

 equation in the integral parameter of the set. We were able to show, at any rate

 formally, that the differential equation and the difference equation form a com-

 patible or 'conjugate' pair in our sense, as do the adjoint pair, and that the two sets

 of solutions form normalized orthogonal sets. This seems to illustrate the unity

 and coherence that our work was bringing to the theory of special functions. We

 had plenty of ideas for further developments when circumstances brought our
 mathematical collaboration to an end.

 Actually, there is a fifth paper (McCrea 1933) on the subject, this time by McCrea

 alone. It was published in the Mathematical Gazette and is of a more expository nature.
 We will come back to it in Sect. 8.3.

 5 On the solution of differential equations by definite integrals

 In this section we begin to analyse the contents of the papers whose genesis has been
 described in Sect. 4, beginning with the one by Whittaker which gave rise to the

 whole sequence. The purpose of Whittaker's paper is clearly stated at its introduction
 (Whittaker 1931, p. 189):

 The object of the present paper is to communicate a general theorem regard-

 ing the solution of both ordinary and partial differential equations by means of

 families of definite integrals.

 As he points out, the motivation is the fact that 'in many cases the solutions of a lin-

 ear differential equation can be expressed as definite integrals'. Although Whittaker

 gives his results for any number of variables, we will state them only for two pairs of

 conjugate variables because this is the only case explicitly described by Kermack and

 McCrea in their papers. However, as they put it in a footnote to (Kermack and McCrea
 1931a, p. 205)

 It is clear [. . .] that [the theory] may be generalised at once to include any number

 of pairs.

 Consider any contact transformation from a pair of conjugate variables (q, p) to

 another pair (g, P), defined by a function W(q, Q). In other words,

 see (3.4). Denoting by Q(q, p) and P(q, p) the variables when expressed in terms of

 p and q, the differential equations

 are compatible and possess a common solution x(#> 0- Note that the operators that
 define the equations were obtained substituting p by d/dq in the expressions of
 Q(q, p) and P(q, p). Whittaker does not go into any details on how this is to be
 done, and this is one of the weakest points in his approach. In the next article we will

 see how Kermack and McCrea proposed to get around this problem using the algebra

 of differential operators.

 Whittaker's General Theorem Suppose that we wish to determine a function ý
 which satisfies a differential equation

 f(*,±)y = 0. (5.3)

 Suppose that, on replacing q and p by their values in terms of P and Q in F(q, p)
 we obtain G(ß, P). Then,

 Ý(q)=Jx(q,t)4>(t)dt

 where </> is the solution of

 g(,.1), = o.

 Immediately after stating the theorem, Whittaker proceeds to show that it is an
 extension of the well-known Laplace transform. To see that, choose W = -qQ.
 Then,

 „ dW J dW

 P „ =

 Replacing p by d/dq in these equations, we find that the equations in (5.2) become,

 ^ = -tX and -W = -£.

 The solution is readily seen to be x = eqt where we are, as Whittaker adds in brack-

 ets, 'neglecting now, as always, an arbitrary multiplicative constant'. Before we can

 state the conclusion of the General Theorem for this example, we must compute the
 operator G. Luckily, in this case all we have to do is replace p by Q and q by - P in
 F, which gives G(ß, P) = F(-P, Q). Thus, it follows from the General Theorem
 that if Ý is a solution of a differential equation (5.3), then

 Mq)=Jeqt4>(t)dt

 where <'> is the solution of

 F(-ÍL,r), = O;

 which shows that Whittaker's theorem is a generalisation of the Laplace Transform,
 as claimed.

 The remainder of the paper, comprising five more sections besides the first three

 discussed here, contains a number of more sophisticated examples related to the hyper-

 geometric function (Sects. 4-7) and the Bessel function (Sect. 8).

 6 On Professor Whittaker's solution of differential equations by definite

 integrals: part I

 As pointed out before, one of the problems with Whittaker's method is, in the words
 of Kermack and McCrea, how to pass

 from a contact transformation in its algebraic form to these partial differential

 equations, in a manner which is unambiguous and which makes them compatible.

 The emphasis is theirs. The introduction of such a method is, according to themselves,

 the 'first object' of their paper. From now on we refer to this paper as Part I, whilst its

 sequel, discussed in the next section, will be called Part II.

 6.1 The method

 Following their approach, we begin with a contact transformation derived from a
 function W(q, Q). Thus, by Sect. 3.2, the transformation is given by

 Next take p and P to be the operators 3/3 ß and -d/dq, respectively. The simulta-
 neous equations that define the function / = x(ô, q) will then be

 which clearly have x = ew for a solution. Then comes the clincher:

 Now this x will satisfy any equations derived from [(6.5), (6.6)] by multiplying

 them by any functions of q or Q, or by differentiating them with respect to q or

 Q, or by any combination of such processes.

 Thus, given operators R(q, -d/dq) and S(q, -d/dq), we have that any function that
 satisfies (6.5), (6.6) also satisfies the two equations

 / a ' r d dW'

 Actually, for the method to work we have to be more careful. We need to know that

 X satisfies equations of the form

 q{q,-^X-Qx = 0 and (6.7)
 4'-¿)*-£r0' (68)

 assuming that they have been determined by the procedure of multiplication by an

 operator described above. Their next step is to simplify the above equations by writ-

 ing them in the form

 [Q(q,p)-QÌX=0 (6.9)

 [P(q,p)-P]X=0, (6.10)

 where we should not forget that P = d/dQ and p = -d/dq. Then comes the follow-
 ing rather cryptic comment:

 It is clear that the passage from [(6.3), (6.4) to (6.9), (6.10)] by the stated pro-
 cesses is exactly equivalent to the algebraic solution of [(6.3), (6.4)] for Q, P in
 terms ofq,p provided that the algebraic operations employed are:
 (i) Pre-multiplication by q, Q, p or P or any function of these,

 (ii) Permutation of the variables according to the equations

 qQ-Qq=0, qP-Pq = 0,

 Qp-pQ=0, pP-Pq=0, (6.11)

 qp-pq = l, QP-PQ = -1.

 (iii) Equal quantities may be added or subtracted but not multiplied or divided.

 These are to replace the ordinary rules of algebra for the present set of variables.

 Since q, Q commute it does not matter in what order the terms in W(q, Q) and
 its derivatives are written.

 In modern parlance these are the equations that define the second Weyl algebra,

 which is the algebra of differential operators of the polynomial ring C[q, Q], Denoting

 by /^the operator of C[q, Q] that corresponds to multiplication byjhe polynomial
 / = f(q, Q), it is easy to show that this algebra is generated by 'q, Q and the partial
 differential operators P = d/dQ and p = -d/dq (see Coutinho 1995, pp. 8-10 for
 example). A straightforward computation shows that these operators satisfy the rules
 reproduced above.

 The paragraphs of Part I quoted above give a sketch of the procedure that Kermack

 and McCrea proposed to use to compute the operators in (6.9) and (6. 10). For the sake

 of clarity, we will perform the required computations in a particular example, as we

 go through the various stages of the procedure as described in Kermack and McCrea
 (1931a, p. 207). In the example, which is taken from Kermack and McCrea (1931a,
 Sect. 3.12), W = q2Q/4, so equations (6.1) and (6.2) become

 6.2 An example

 4

 P - %- = 0 (6.12)
 /? + ^=0 (6.13)

 The description of the procedure begins as follows:

 We can solve equation [(6.2)], which involves only p, q and g, for the variable
 Q according to the rules and obtain

 Q(q,p)-Q = 0 (6.14)

 giving equation [(6.9)] at once.

 -2- -0 = 0; so that Q(g,p) = -2-.
 q q

 pq-l-q-lp = q~2' (6-15>

 However, taking into account the meaning of p and q as operators, the most natural
 choice is Q(q, p) = -2q~lp, which is the operator chosen in Kermack and McCrea

 Applying this to the example, we have to solve (6.13) with respect to Q, which gives

 Note that this is not quite as straightforward as it looks because the 'fraction' p/q is
 not well-defined. Since p and q do not commute, pq~x ^ q~XP- Indeed, it follows
 from (9) that

 (1931a, Sect. 3.12, Eq. 19). Thus, in this example, Eq. 6.9 is given by

 Proceeding in this way we may write in general, if F(Q) is any function of Q,

 Whittaker on contact transformations 68 1

 [-2q-lp-Q]X=0.

 The description continues as follows:

 From [(6.14)] we obtain, for example,

 Q(q,p)2-Q2 = 0, (6.16)

 where we must obey the rules laid down in forming

 Q(q,pf = Q(q,p)xQ(q,p)l]

 F{Q(g,p))-F(Q) = 0.

 Let us compute Q(q, p)2 for Q(q, p) = -2q~lp. Using (6.15) we find that

 (-q-lp)(-q-lp) = q~'p{q~x)p) = q~'-q~xp + <rV

 Hence,

 Q(qiP)2 = -4q-2p2-q-3p.

 Of course any polynomial function of p and q can then be written in the desired form.

 This is the method they apply to compute (6.10):

 Consequently, if we write [(6.1)] in such a way that in each term of
 9W(#, Q)/dQ the part depending on Q comes last, we have merely to sub-
 stitute for Q its value already found in [(6.14)]. This gives equation [(6.10)], and
 we have now derived [(6.9), (6.10)] in such a manner that x is still a solution.

 Since, in our example,

 dW _ q2

 which does not depend on Q, we obtain

 without any need for further calculations. This example is so simple that it obscures

 the many difficulties that one may have to overcome in order to apply the procedure.
 However, Kermack and McCrea are quite clear about these difficulties:

 682 S. C. Coutinho

 The processes employed may be called pre-multiplication zná post-substitution.

 It is evident from the operational form of the equations that we may substitute

 only for a quantity which immediately precedes the x • In practical cases we may

 always check the algebra by verifying that x remains a solution of any equation

 obtained. These rules never permit of any ambiguity of interpretation. The only

 difficulty is that sometimes they do not yield a solution in finite terms of [(6.2)]
 for Q. This is the case, for example, if one requires the solution of a general
 quadratic equation. There seems to be nothing corresponding to 'completion of

 the square' of ordinary algebra, but we may assume there exists a formal solution
 in series.

 Indeed, as we will see later in Sect. 9.1 the fact that the authors assume that such

 'formal solutions' always exist is one of the weakest points of the paper even when

 judged by the standards of the 1930s.

 6.3 Definite integrals

 Immediately after the comment quoted above, Kermack and McCrea turn to the anal-

 ysis of Whittaker's approach to the solution of definite integrals. Let us assume that

 Ý(q)=Jx(q,t)<Kt)at (6.17)

 and that 0 satisfies a given linear differential equation; say

 G(ř'^W)=0; (6.18)

 where G(ß, P) can be written as a sum of monomials of the form Pn Qm. They begin

 by studying the action of one of these monomials on ý (q). Writing both P and Q in
 terms of q and p = -d/dq, we have

 pnQm^ =Jpn ^ _^ Qm ^ _^ ^ tm)àt%

 which equals

 / pn (*- "¿) tmx(q' t)<t>mt = I hpn'x {q' "¿) tn>x(q' tm)àt'

 by the two equations of (6.7). On integrating by parts once, we obtain

 Pn-lx tm<l>-J Pn~l (q, ~' ± {tmx(q, 00(0) di;

 and if we keep doing this we end up with an expression of the form

 / H ' n~^ 1

 [H p»-ix . tm<t> - p"-2x-(tm4>) + ■■■ + (-i)"-1/ y^j (tm<P)
 +(-l)nJx(^)'tm<t>)dt- (6.19)

 Since these calculations apply to each one of the monomials of G we get that

 / X(i. t)G (t, 1) *m = I + G (q (,, -A) , _p (,, _£)) ,(i),

 where I is a sum of terms like the one that appears in square brackets in (6.19).
 Choosing the path of integration C such that I vanishes on C and taking (6.18) into
 account,

 which is actually the converse of Whittaker's original theorem. But, as the authors

 point out in Sect. 3.2 of their paper, the original statement can be proved in essentially

 the same way. The result is summarised on page 208 of Part 1 as follows:

 If the function </> satisfies a given differential equation G(ß, P)(/> = 0, then the

 definite integral [(6.17)], taken along a suitable path, will satisfy the differential
 equation obtained by substituting for Q, P in G(Q, P) the values of Q(q, p)
 and -P(q,p) derived according to the given rules. The order of the factors in
 terms like Pn Qm must be preserved.

 They give a nice application of this result to the integral

 Ý(q) = J exp í^' (1 + ř)"5"1 d - t)kn-l)àt;

 c

 with C chosen as the 'contour that encircles t = - 1 and begins and ends at - oo'
 Taking / = exp(#2ř/4), it follows that W = q2t/4. Thus, in this case, (5.1) gives
 P = q2/4 and p = -qQ/2; which when solved for g, P9 give Q = -2q~lp and
 P = q2/4. Now, our choice of x requires that <f>(t) = (1 + t)~%~l(l - t)?(n~l'
 which is easily shown to satisfy the differential equation

 <'2-»£-H-ï')*=o;

 which corresponds to the differential operator

 G(ß, P) = (ß2 - 1)P - (n + l- - 3-q} .

 Substituting the expressions for Q, P in terms ofq,p obtained above in this operator,

 we find that 'j/ must be a zero of

 / , d id 'q2 ( 1 id'
 V áq áq ) 4 V 2 áq J

 Note that (^~1d/d^)(^~1d/d^) must be computed according to the rules of the alge-

 bra established in Sect. 6. 1 . Performing this rather messy calculation, we may write

 the equation for ý in the form

 d20 / 11 2'

 A look at some standard reference like Watson and Whittaker ( 1 963 , Sect. 1 6.5 , p. 347)

 shows that this is the Weber equation, which received this name because it appears in

 a paper of Weber (1869) on the solution of a partial differential equation that arises

 when one studies certain physical problems (like heat propagation) on cylindrical sur-

 faces. In the language of Whittaker and Watson, the calculations we performed above

 amount to proving that ^ is a constant multiple of the parabolic cylinder function Dn.

 In other words, we have given an integral representation for Dn . See also Watson and

 Whittaker (1963, Exercise 11, p. 353), where the constant of proportionality is given

 explicitly.

 6.4 Generalised equations

 It turns out that to subsume all the examples in Whittaker 's paper (1931) under this
 scheme it is necessary to consider what Kermack and McCrea call generalised equa-
 tions for the function x • Let

 Px=h(piq)x (620)
 Qx=Hp,q)x,

 be a pair of compatible differential equations, and let S be a function of q and p.
 Recall that we are assuming that P = 3/3 ß and p = -d/dq. Note that, with this
 interpretation, œ is actually a differential operator on q, p. Multiplying both sides of
 (6.20) by S"1 , we have

 œ~xPx =cû~Xh(p,q)x
 ü>~lQx =cú~Xk(p,q)x.

 Since, according to the relations satisfied by q, p, g, P, the operator co commutes
 with both g and P, these last equations become

 Writing x* = cú~1x and taking into account that a>~xœ = 1, we end up with a new

 g, P, the relations

 n-1JÎ(j8,P)nX*=S-1A(p^)Sx*
 n-lK(Q,P)nx* =œ-xk(p,q)a>x*.

 yield a new pair of compatible equations whose solution is given by x * = ^5~ 1 n ~ l x •

 For example, by taking n = g, we can transform the system

 PX =qQ~lX
 PX = -logg/,

 into

 qX* = PQx* ,,9n (6-21)
 PX* = -loggx*, ,,9n (6-21)

 where x* = g"1 X • Moreover, since g^ is a solution of the original system, it follows
 that x* = Qq~x satisfies (6.21).

 In the remainder of their paper, Kermack and McCrea discuss the case whereby
 the generating function of the contact transformation has P and p as its independent
 variables (Sect. 5.1) and the composition of transformations, which they call suc-
 cessive transformations (Sect. 6.1), giving several examples along the way. This last
 topic leads to a method that can be used to evaluate definite integrals based on the
 elimination of operators between two given equations (Sects. 6.2 and 6.3).

 integrals: part II

 7 On Professor Whittaker's solution of differential equations by definite

 Subtitled Applications of the methods of non-commutative algebra, Part II continues

 the search for solutions of ever more general differential equations that began in Parti.

 Indeed, as the authors state at the very beginning of the paper:

 It will be shown in the present communication that the necessary and sufficient

 condition that [the system (6.7)] should be compatible is that

 Q(q, p)P(q, p) - P(q, p)Q(q, p) = 1, (7.1)

 regarded as an equation in the non-commutative variables q , p which themselves

 satisfy the condition

 qp-pq = '. (7.2)

 We shall call functions satisfying this condition conjugate functions. From this

 point of view the method employed by Professor Whittaker in his original paper,

 involving the use of a contact transformation, was really a particular method

 of generating conjugate functions. This powerful method may be supplemented

 and extended by the other methods developed in the following pages.

 However, in order to do this they found it necessary to dig deeper into the underlying

 non-commutative algebra

 In working out this theory it has been found necessary to develop somewhat the

 algebra of non-commutative variables obeying the law [(7.2)].

 The paper is divided into three parts, which we call ILA, II.B, and II.C, that we discuss

 in some detail below. All the proofs in Part II are formal calculations with expressions

 in q and p, taking into account only the commutation relation qp - pq - '.

 7.1 Non-commutative algebra

 In Part II. A the authors investigate some properties of the algebra of non-commuta-

 tive operators that are required for the applications in subsequent parts. They begin
 by formally defining the derivative of an operator with respect to q and p, denoted
 by 8/8q and 8/8p respectively, and by proving that the rules they introduce corre-
 spond to commuting with the conjugate operator. Thus, if K(q, p) is an element in
 the non-commutative algebra generated by q and p, then

 8J^. 8q = K(q1p)p-pK(qip);

 8q

 as shown in Sect. 3, Theorem I. As Kermack and McCrea themselves point out, this

 had already been observed by Dirac (Dirac 1926a,b; also in van der Waerden 1967,
 pp. 307-320, Ml-'21). The uniqueness of this derivative is proved in Theorem II.
 Defining integration as the 'process inverse to differentiation', it is shown in Theorem

 Whittaker on contact transformations 687

 III that every function has an integral with respect to q and that this integral is unique

 up to a function of q. Of course, a similar result holds for integrals relative to p.

 Following present terminology we have chosen to refer to K(q, p) above as an ele-

 ment of the non-commutative algebra generated by q and /?, but Kermack and McCrea

 call it a 'function of q and p' Indeed, although they call attention to some of the prob-

 lems encountered in calculating with these 'functions', like using the correct relations

 when swapping sides, they are never clear about the hypotheses these 'functions' have

 to satisfy for the theory to make sense mathematically. As they put it:

 All mixed derivatives are independent of the order of differentiation, provided the

 necessary differentiability conditions are satisfied. It would, however, be difficult

 to formulate conditions of convergence or continuity or differentiability in the

 present variables. In this paper, we leave aside such considerations and assume

 that the functions with which we deal are such that we may legitimately perform
 the required operations upon them. (Kermack and McCrea 1931b, p. 221)

 This is essentially Dirac's point of view in Dirac (1926b) (also in van der Waerden
 1967, pp. 417-427).

 The fact is that it would have been easy to give a formal justification for these

 results if one could restrict oneself to polynomial functions in q and p. This, however,
 is not enough for the intended applications. Indeed, most of Part ILA of the paper
 is concerned with functions defined by series, specially the exponential function. In
 order to do this, it is necessary first to find a binomial formula for (p + q)n. As a

 preparation they prove in Theorem IV that if the derivatives of L(q, p) with respect to

 q and p coincide, then L(q, p) is a function of q + p. Theorem V gives the familiarly
 looking formula

 oq op

 An induction is then used in Theorem VI to show that

 (/> + <?)" _^/lV 1 (Pi+q)n-2j n„ (7-3)
 -^-±{ï) ß (n-2jV. ' n„ (7-3)

 where

 (pi+q)n = Ít(n)pn~J<lJ W

 7=0 W

 is the 'usual' binomial formula, written so that p always precedes q. Note that (7.3)
 is a finite sum, since only finitely many of its terms are non-zero.

 Turning now to Sect. 6, we find the definition and properties of the exponential
 function in q and p. Take eq, for instance. Since this is a function of q only, it may
 be defined with the help of the usual infinite series. The same, of course, holds for

 ď. However, problems related to the non-commutativity of q and p take over when

 we try to find what ď+q should be. The solution is given in Theorems VII and VIII,

 The remainder of Part ILA (Sect. 8) consists of a long and drawn out formal calculation

 that leads to a formula for (q + 0 (p))n in terms of the exponential function of a series,

 where 0 is 'any function of p'

 7.2 The solution of differential equations

 In Part II.B we come to the applications of non-commutative algebra to differential

 equations. The section begins with two 'preliminary results', the first of which (The-
 orem X) states that every element of the algebra in q, p is conjugate to q. In other

 words, given any p(q, p), there exists co(q, p) such that

 p(q, p) = co(q, p)qco(q, p)~X . (7.4)

 Their 'proof of this result is as follows. First, (7.4) is equivalent to

 p(q,p)œ(q,p) =œ(q,p)q,

 ~ ~ S(õ(q9p)
 co(q, ~ p)q = qo>(q, ~ P)

 whilst,

 so that

 8p

 which they consider as a differential equation to be solved by the method of undeter-
 mined coefficients. In order to do this both a>(q, p) and q - p are written as power

 series on p whose coefficients are functions on q. This leads to a recursive system that
 the authors claim can be formally solved.

 Now let p(q, p) be any element of the algebra in q, p, and let cû(q, p) be chosen

 so that (7.4) is satisfied. Then, if

 cr(q, p) = a>(q, p)pco(q, p)~X

 it follows that pa - op = 1; and p and a are said to be conjugate functions. This
 is Theorem XI, which states that for every 'function' p(q, p) there is a 'function'

 o(q,p) such that p and a are conjugate. The converse of this result is given in Theo-
 rem XII, where it is shown that every pair of conjugate functions can be obtained by

 conjugating q and p with an appropriate 'function' œ(q, p). Their proof of this result

 makes use of the exponential defined in the Part ILA.

 It is only with Theorem XIII (Sect. 10) that we properly turn to the applications of

 these results to differential equations. More precisely, the authors prove that a pair of

 equations of the form

 Q(q,p)x = Qx r7Sx { }
 P(q,p)X = Px r7Sx { }

 is compatible if and only if Q (q , p) and P(q, p) are conjugate as functions of the oper-
 ators q and p = -d/dq. Writing the commutator Q(q, p)P(q, p) - P(q, p)Q{q, p)
 as [Q(q, p), P(q, /?)], we have from (7.5) that

 [P(q,p),Q(q,p)]X = [Q,P]X=X'

 where the last equality follows by taking P = d/dQ as in Part I. Next, the authors
 claim that if [P(q, p), Q(q, p)] / 1 then the previous equation implies that / (q, Q)
 may be written as a product,

 where ([Q(q, p), P(q, p)] - l)X = 0. This, however, is not compatible with the
 original system, thus proving that [P(q, p), Q(q, p)] = 1. Conversely, if P(q, p)
 and Q(q, p) are conjugate, then there exists a function a> such that

 Q = ã(q, p)qœ(qi p)~x and P = a>~x {q, p)pcú(q, p). (7.6)

 In this case, (7.5) has a solution given by œ(q, p)t~qQ' so the equations are indeed
 compatible.

 Theorem XIII is used to give a unified approach to the two methods of constructing
 contact transformations used in Part I. Recall that, in the first method, the contact

 transformation was constructed from a generating function W(q, Q)' whilst, in the
 second, P(q, p) and Q{q, p) were given as in (7.6). In terms of the integral (6.17),
 the kernel x (which they call a nucleus) equals e^ in the first method and a>t~qQ in

 the second. The equivalence of these two methods is made explicit in the following
 theorem.

 Theorem XIV To any given œ-function there corresponds a X'fanction given by
 X(q> Q) = 25(#, p)e~qQ = e~qQ(o(q, Q), and to any ^-function there corresponds
 a œ-function given by co(q, Q) = eq@x(q, Q)-

 The next result (Theorem XV) proposes a method for constructing a family of con-

 tact transformations. It is followed by two theorems of a very general nature. Consider
 a differential equation

 g(q, p)yfr = 0, where p = -d/dq.

 Theorem XVI The solution of this equation is given by

 690 S. C. Coutinho

 1r(q)=fiï(q,p)e-*tdt (7.7)

 where œ is defined by g(q, p) = - cůqa)~x;

 Theorem XVII IfG(Q, P)</> = 0 is any other linear differential equation, then there

 exists a function x such that

 Ý(q)=J X(q,P)<P(Q)dQ, (7.8)

 for a suitable path of integration.

 Thus, whilst Theorem XVI gives a general formula for the solution of any linear dif-

 ferential equation, Theorem XVII shows that the solutions of any two such equations

 are connected by an integral formula.

 The proofs of both theorems follow by combining previous results from Parts I and

 II. Thus, by Theorem X, there exists co such that g(q, p) = -œqco~x , and by Theorem
 XIV we have an explicit formula for the corresponding x -function. Let 0 = 0(ř) be
 a function that satisfies d0/di = 0. Hence, P(j)(q) = 0 and by Part I, the function 'jr
 defined in (7.7) is a solution of g{q, p)^ = 0; which proves Theorem XVI.

 In order to prove Theorem XVII we must first introduce the adjoint G of G as the

 operator obtained by 'reversing the order of each term and changing the sign of P9
 (Kermack and McCrea 1931b, p. 234). Next, we determine (Theorem X) œ(q, p) and
 Y'(q, p) suchthat

 g(q, p) = -œqœ~x and G(q, p) = -n^FT1.

 Thus, x = coTle~qQ is a solution of the equations

 -œqœ-xx = TÌPYTìx C7-9)
 a>pœ~xx = nQT'-xx (7.10)

 which, being compatible, define a contact transformation from q, p to ß, P. Thus,
 by (7.9), g(q, p) = G(Q, P). But this is exactly the condition required to apply the
 results of Part I in order to conclude that if 0 satisfies G(g, P)<j> = 0 then the function

 Ý defined by (7.8) satisfies g(q, p)f = 0.

 Part II.B ends with an integral formula for the function œ that satisfies Q(q, p) =

 a>pa>~x . Suppose that the function x corresponding to the given contact transformation
 is known, and let 6(Q, t) be the function defined by

 e-«Q=[o(Q,t)x(q,t)dt.

 Since x = 5e~*ř, then

 œ~le-qQ = [ 0(Q,t)e-qtdt,

 is the desired formula.

 7.3 The identical transformation and infinitesimal transformations

 This short part collects a miscellany of results. Of course the identical transformation
 of the title is the one given by Q = q and P = p. Applying Whittaker's Theo-
 rem to this transformation it is possible to prove the well-known property of Dirac's

 ¿-function; namely,

 Ý(q) = Jir(t)S(t-q)dt.

 An infinitesimal transformation is a deformation of the identical transformation by a

 function depending on a parameter e whose square vanishes. The authors prove that,
 for any 6(q, p) the formulae

 Q = q- €80 /Sp and P = p + eSO/Sp

 define a contact transformation. Articles 15-17 discuss some identities, including a
 generalisation of Taylor's Theorem to non-commutative variables. Finally, in Sect. 18
 the authors state that every algebra whose generators q, r satisfy qr - rq = F(r, q)
 'can be reduced to the algebra for which' qp - pq = 1. This has to be interpreted
 with great care because it is not true that every algebra with a relation of this sort is

 isomorphic to the Weyl algebra; indeed, we need only take qr - rq = 0 to see that.

 The argument given in the paper depends on infinite series in q, p which, as we shall
 see, can cause all sorts of problems; see Sect. 9.1 for more details.

 8 Three more papers

 In this section we discuss two shorter papers of Kermack and McCrea that explore
 and extend some of the themes discussed in Parts I and II, and a more elementary
 exposition of these methods written by McCrea for the Mathematical Gazette. The

 notation we have been using will remain in force throughout this section.

 8.1 An operational method

 The main result of this paper is a formula for ifr in terms 0 that, unlike (7.7), does not

 involve integration. In keeping with the policy of Parts I and II we consider only the

 2-dimensional case of the result. This is essentially what the authors do for, although

 the statement is given in full generality in Kermack and McCrea (1931c, p. 177), they

 prove it only in dimension two.

 Theorem 8.1 Consider a contact transformation from the variables q, p to the vari-
 ables Q, P derived from the function W(q, P), so that

 Q = - and p= -

 and suppose that the variables g, P when expressed in terms ofq, p are denoted by
 Q(<7, /?), P(q, p). Suppose that(p(Q) satisfies the differential equation G(Q, P)</> =
 0, where P = 3/8 Q. Let F(q, p)'/r = 0 be the equation obtained by substituting
 Q(q, p)for Q and - P(#, p)for Pf where p = -d/dq. Then

 Kermack and McCrea give two proofs of this result, both of which take as their

 starting point the integral expression for ý in terms of </> given in (6.17) and formally

 deduce from it the required differential expression (see Kermack and McCrea 1931c,

 p. 177). Neither of these proofs is complete, a fact that the authors themselves point

 out; adding that:

 There is much more that requires investigation about the nature of the functions

 for which the result holds and the paths of integration used to obtain it, and about

 the degree of generality when obtained. We do not attempt this investigation, but

 pass on to applications of the general theorem.

 See Kermack and McCrea (1931c, p. 176). After a brief discussion of how Theorem

 8. 1 can be generalised in the spirit of Part II, the authors turn to what they call special
 cases. By taking W = qP, they argue in Sect. 6 that the theorem can be seen as a

 generalisation of Taylor's Theorem, which they write in the form

 Ý(x + h) = ehá/áxÝ(x).

 In Sect. 7 they use their method to give a new proof of a result by Fischer (1929,
 Sect. 10, p. 226ff) on the moment-generating function; whilst Sect. 8 is concerned
 with obtaining a differential equation satisfied by a function series. This in turn leads
 to a method that allows them 'formally to reduce the solution of any [linear] differ-

 ential equation [...] to a simple quadrature, together with the solution of a problem
 in non-commutative algebra' (see Kermack and McCrea 1931c, Sect. 9, p. 184). The

 'problem in non-commutative algebra' is that of finding the 'roots' p of the equation
 p = F(q, p) - 1, where F is a polynomial expression in q, p = -d/dq. Generating
 functions are the theme of Sect. 10, where it is shown that their method can be used to

 derive differential and difference equations for the functions of q that constitute the

 coefficients of the power series in t of a generating function eu^qJK

 Whittaker on contact transformations 693

 From Sect. 12 (infinitesimal transformations) and throughout the whole of the final

 section (called 'examples and applications') Kermack and McCrea apply these results
 to various choices of W9 deriving from some of them new proofs of well-known
 results about special functions such as Bessel's function (Sect. 14), Hermite polyno-
 mials (Sect. 15) and Laguerre polynomials (Sect. 16).

 8.2 On compatible differential equations

 The authors explain the aim of this paper as follows:

 In some previous work [i.e. the three papers we have already discussed] we have

 defined conjugate partial differential equations for a function of two variables.

 In the present paper we begin by examining more fully the condition for their

 compatibility and that of their adjoint equations. We then extend the work to the

 case where, instead of partial derivatives with respect to one of the variables,
 we have differences with respect to that variable. This is the case applicable to
 discrete eigenvalues. It is well known that the eigen-solutions of a linear dif-
 ferential equation involving a parameter are orthogonal to those of its adjoint

 equation. This parameter can be treated as the second variable in this work, and
 a difference equation with respect to its eigenvalues can be written down for

 the eigenfunctions. What we now show is that the eigen-solutions of this differ-

 ential and difference equation, and those of the adjoint pair of equations, form
 normalized orthogonal sets.

 See Kermack and McCrea (1933, p. 81). This is followed by the usual disclaimer:

 We do not examine fully the general conditions under which the latter theorem

 is true. Our purpose is rather to show how it can be used to predict the existence

 and form of orthogonality relations, the strict validity of which may require
 independent investigation.

 As the statement above indicates, Sect. 2 begins with a study of the system

 (ß(*,p)-ß)X=0 (8.1)

 (P(qìP)-P)X=0 (8.2)

 which, by Theorem XIII of Part II (see Sect. 7), is compatible if and only if

 Q(q, p)P(q, p) - P(q, p)Q(g, p) = 1. (8.3)

 This is followed by one of the main results of the paper.

 Theorem II If the condition [8.3] is satisfied, and ifQ(q, p) is an integral function
 °fP of degree n, then there are in general n, and only n, common solutions x(#, Q)
 of [8.1, 8.2], linearly independent in both q and Q.

 The proof they proposed is rather clever and deserves to be reproduced here.

 Following the authors, we give it only for « = 3. Since Q(q, p) has degree n = 3

 in p = -d/dq9 it follows that Eq. 8.1 is a linear differential equation of the third
 order. As such, it has a basis of three elements, which we denote by xi, X2 and X3-

 These are functions of q and Q, and every other solution of (8.1) can be written as a
 linear combination of xi , X2 and X3 with coefficients that are functions of g. All the

 computations that follow take place in the algebra generated by q, p, Q, P, subject
 to the rules stated in Sect. 6.1. Multiplying (Q(q, p) - Q)Xj = 0 respectively by
 P(q, p) and P, and using the commutation relations, we get the two equations

 (Q(q, p)P(q, P) - QP(q, p) " DXy = 0

 (Q(q,p)P-QP-l)Xj=O;

 which, when added up and factored, give rise to

 (Q(q,p)-QKP(q,p)-P)Xj=O.

 Thus (P(q, p) - P)Xj is a solution of (8.1) and, as such, may be written in the form

 (P(q,p)-P)Xj =<*j'Xi +aj2X2 + aj3X3.

 Thus, if x =¿1X1 + ¿2X2 + ¿3X3> we obtain from the previous equations that

 (P(q, p) - P)x = ¿ (aijbi + a2jb2 + a3jb3 - ¿}) Xj, (8.4)

 where bf- = dbj/dQ. Thus x is also a solution of (8.2) if and only if the ¿s satisfy
 the system of differential equations given by the vanishing of the coefficients of xi,
 X2 and X3 in (8.4). By eliminating two of the bs, say b' and ¿2, we can produce a

 linear differential equation of the third order in the remaining b3. This equation is then

 solved, and each one of its three solutions will give rise to a triple ¿1 , ¿2, ¿3 that is a

 solution of the required system, thus completing the proof of the theorem.

 Adjoint equations (already defined in Sect. 7.2 above) are introduced in Sect. 2,
 where it is also proved that if a pair of equations is compatible then so are their

 adjoints. Difference equations appear for the first time in Sect. 3 as an equality of the
 form (S(q, p) - ep)x = 0, where ep is the operator formally defined by ep/(ß) =
 f(Q + 1). Two theorems are then stated. According to the first (Theorem IV) the

 system

 (Q(q,p)-Q)X=0 (8.5)
 (S(q,p)-ep)x=0, (8.6)

 is compatible if and only if

 Q(q, p)S(q, p) - S(q, p)Q(q, p) = S(q, p),

 when qp - pq = 1; whilst the second (Theorem V) is the analogue of Theorem II
 above for this system of equations. Finally, it is pointed out that the adjoint of the

 operator ep is e~p; so the adjoints of equations (8.5) are

 The orthogonality of x and x*, mentioned in the introduction to the paper (see quo-
 tation above), can be formally stated as

 a

 j X(q,Q)X*(q,Q')eq = k8QQ>i

 where 8qq> is Kronecker's delta symbol. These orthogonality relations are proved in
 Theorem VII of Sect. 5 by an integration by parts argument. A comment is required

 concerning the limits of integration a and b. It is assumed that

 the pair of solutions x and x* can be made to satisfy 'suitable boundary con-
 ditions at end-points q = a,q = b (say), by restricting Q to assume integral
 eigenvalues.

 See Kermack and McCrea (1933, p. 87). What these 'suitable boundary conditions'
 are, depends on the equations, some of which are discussed in Sects. 9-12. These
 include Legendre polynomials (Sect. 10), parabolic cylinder functions (Sect. 11) and
 Bessel functions (Sect. 12). This leaves out Sects. 6-8, which treat of some possible

 generalisations of the previously discussed methods. Article 8, on continuous eigen-

 values, deserves to be quoted in full:

 A similar theory can be written down formally for the case of continuous eigen-

 values, with Dirac's ¿-function replacing the Kronecker ¿-symbol. But the sat-

 isfaction of the boundary conditions appears to be more difficult, and we have

 not succeeded in constructing examples for which it holds.

 See Kermack and McCrea (1933, p. 89).

 8.3 Operational proofs of some identities

 This is the shortest of the four papers. It contains a brief explanation, by McCrea
 alone, of the method developed in the previous papers with some applications to
 special functions (Bessel and Legendre). We quote the first paragraph in full for the

 opinion it contains on the merits of the method and the status of the theory of special
 functions in the 1930s:

 The interest of pure mathematicians is nowadays shifting from the study of spe-

 cial functions to general function theory. In fact the study of special functions

 might ultimately be forsaken, as for example in geometry the study of the trian-

 gle is now virtually a closed chapter, were it not for one important consideration.

 That is, that these functions must always be in constant use in mathematical
 physics. Hence their properties tend to become questions of practical applica-
 tion rather than of theoretical interest. It follows that there is a demand for some

 method, if only a formal one, which will derive the required properties in an

 expeditious manner, without always calling for the services of the professional

 pure mathematician. The purpose of this note is to show how a beginning might

 be made by using a calculus of operators. We illustrate the method by obtaining

 some identities for functions of hypergeometric type.

 See McCrea (1933, p. 43). This point of view is reinforced at the conclusion, where it
 is said that

 The point illustrated, however, is that [the identities] can all be discovered by

 the single method of transforming operators.

 See McCrea (1933, p. 45).

 9 Discussion

 As far as I can determine these papers had essentially no impact on the mathematics of

 the twentieth century. In this section we seek to answer two questions. The first is why

 this might be so; the second is whether this constitutes a case of a missed opportunity,
 as defined by Dyson (1972).

 9.1 On rigour, and its absence

 As the quotations given in Sects. 7.1,8.1 and 8.2 indicate, Kermack and McCrea knew

 very well that theirs was a formal method, that would require a lot of work to become

 acceptable by the standards of rigour of the 1930s. We begin with a problem that had
 already been explicitly discussed in a paper published at about the same time, the
 convergence of a series in q and p = -d/dq.

 Recall that such series are necessary as long as we consider generalised equations

 of the type introduced in Sect. 6.4, which are defined by conjugating with an operator

 a>(q, p). Since all elements in the algebra generated by q, p are implicitly taken to be
 sums of monomials in q and /?, we can only apply the results of Part I if 5(#, p)~x
 can be so written. However, such a sum would very often be infinite; a series, in other
 words.

 The convergence of series in the algebra generated byq.p subject to pq - qp = 1
 was discussed by Littlewood (1931, pp. 217-219). As Littlewood points out, there is

 no difficulty in defining what it should mean to say that a sum of monomials in q, p

 is convergent. However, as he puts it:

 If two such series were multiplied, a question of convergence would arise, as
 indeed it would in the multiplication of two infinite matrices.

 See Littlewood (1931, p. 217). Indeed, it follows from pq -qp = l that

 Whittaker on contact transformations 697

 Pnqn = pq(pq + l)~-(pq + n-l).

 Thus, for example, if we try to write the product (X/x)0*/7*) (Xy>o^#/ asaseries

 in the monomials qkpl, we must deal with the sum

 ;>o

 which need not be finite even when X¿>o aiPl anci X/>o hq1 are convergent. Little-
 wood, however, adds that

 Without making any attempt to obtain best possible conditions, we give a suf-
 ficient condition that multiplication should be possible according to the usual

 rules. If, in the series of the form ^amtnpmxn for existent terms, m - n is
 bounded above (alternatively below) products are always convergent, and in the
 product m - n is still bounded above (below).

 Of course x denotes what we have been calling q, and an 'existent term' is one whose
 coefficient is nonzero.

 Actually, as Littlewood also points out, although it is always possible to rewrite a

 convergent series ^ aminpnqm into the form ^ bmfnqmpn, the latter need not be con-
 vergent, so that 'it would appear to be necessary to restrict our infinite series to some
 specific form' (Littlewood 1931, p. 217). The way out he proposes is to allow only

 infinite series of the form ^bmtnqmpn. Unfortunately, by doing that we introduce
 zero divisors; for example,

 (,_.,+¿¿_£¿+...)f_fll

 as one readily checks (Littlewood 1931, p. 218). Hence:

 Instead of extending our original algebra thus by means of infinite series, we

 can extend it by defining new quantities which are both right-hand and left-hand
 inverses of polynomial expressions in x [q in our notation] and p.

 See Littlewood (1931, p. 219). This approach is satisfactory from Littlewood's point
 of view because his aim is to construct a division ring that contains the ring generated
 by q, p subject to pq - qp = 1. We, however, require more, because our elements

 must act on functions in some way, and it is not clear what the action of such an inverse
 should be. For more details on Littlewood's paper, see Coutinho (2004). In Sect. 9.3
 we will see how these problems were dealt with in the context of modern algebraic
 analysis.

 Reading these papers in chronological order, one gets the impression that the authors

 became so deeply aware of the obstacles to formalizing their results that they began

 to suspect that such a formalization might not be possible. Thus, in Part I they seem

 rather optimistic, writing that:

 The only difficulty is that sometimes they do not yield a solution in finite terms

 of [(6.1), (6.2)] for Q. [. . .] but we may assume there exists a formal solution in
 series.

 By the time they wrote Part II, the difficulties are spelt out more clearly:

 It would, however, be difficult to formulate conditions of convergence or conti-

 nuity or differentiability in the present variables.

 But are immediately swept under the carpet:

 we leave aside such considerations [of convergence] and assume that the func-

 tions with which we deal are such that we may legitimately perform the required

 operations upon them.

 In Kermack and McCrea (1931c) this has become the less optimistic:

 There is much more that requires investigation about the nature of the functions

 for which the result holds and the paths of integration used to obtain it, and about

 the degree of generality when obtained.

 And, once again, they make clear that such investigation will not be carried out. A
 similar observation is made in Kermack and McCrea (1933). By the time McCrea
 (1933) was written, one almost senses a feeling of despondency. To begin with, even

 the study of special functions seems to be at a low ebb, for

 [t]he interest of pure mathematicians is nowadays shifting from the study of

 special functions to general function theory.

 However, since such functions are still important in physics,

 [i]t follows that there is a demand for some method, if only a formal one, which

 will derive the required properties in an expeditious manner [...].

 Thus,

 [t]he purpose of this note is to show how a beginning [my emphasis] might be
 made by using a calculus of operators.

 As the conclusion quoted above makes clear, what is proposed is no more than a
 method for the discovery of these identities, that can then be proved rigorously by

 pure mathematicians.

 One final point concerns the local character of the results. Modern algebraic anal-

 ysis makes use of sheaf theory to prove results over general manifolds, but Kermack
 and McCrea do not even say whether they mean their results to be taken locally or

 globally. This, however, is not a true fault of theirs, for such considerations would have
 to wait for the second half of the twentieth century. At that time, results were implicitly

 taken to hold only in the neighbourhood of a point, whenever that may be necessary.
 Of course there were conflicts. After all, some of the definite integrals are computed

 along paths that go to infinity; as we saw in Sect. 6.3. However, these problems were
 dealt with case by case.

 9.2 Algebraic analysis

 Although the papers of Kermack and McCrea do not seem to have had any influence on

 the mathematics of the twentieth century (see Sect. 9.1), many of their results entered

 mainstream mathematics as part of what became known as algebraic analysis. This is

 an umbrella term for the study of (holomorphic) linear differential equations by alge-
 bro-geometric methods: rings, modules, sheaves and cohomology (see Houzel 1990,
 1998). More concretely, one can think of algebraic analysis as the study of modules

 over rings of differential operators. Such a module can be associated to both, a system

 of linear differential equations and the space in which we seek its solutions. In this

 language the solutions of a given differential equation are homomorphisms from the
 module that represents the differential equation to the one where the solutions are
 sought; see Coutinho (1995) or Björk (1979).

 Algebraic analysis is a rather young subject, whose history is yet to be written.

 Luckily, we need little more than a time line of its main achievements up to the early
 1990s, for our aim is merely to show in what way the work of Kermack and McCrea

 can be formalized within this theory.

 Algebraic geometrical methods entered the theory of linear differential equations
 in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the case of constant coefficients, a differential

 operator can be considered as a polynomial in the d/dxs. Thus a system of linear

 differential equations with constant coefficients gives rise to an algebraic variety, that

 can be used to tease out the properties of the differential system. This is done, for
 example, in Hormander (1955, Sect. 3.1, p. 211) and Matsuura (1961, Sect. 4, p. 96).
 At about the same time M. Sato, then a postgraduate student and high school teacher

 in Japan, was developing the theory of hyperfunctions:

 during the summer of 1 957 1 tried to prepare something that I could show him [his

 advisor, Shõkichi Iy anaga] , and that was hyperfunctions. I worked out hyperfunc-

 tion series and outlined the theory for several variables - though the complete

 theory was finished later, since it required a generalisation of cohomology theory.

 In December of that year, I went to see Professor Iyanaga, after an interruption
 of some years, and told him about it.

 See Andronikof (2007, p. 211). Sato's algebro-geometric approach to the theory of
 linear differential equations was first systematized in the 1970 Master thesis of his

 student M. Kashiwara. This often quoted work, whose original was handwritten in
 pencil, was only published in 1995 (see Kashiwara 1995). Kashiwara and Kawai, also

 a student of Sato, helped him to develop and write his ideas on microdifferential anal-

 ysis, which can be roughly described as analysis done in the cotangent bundle. This is

 the origin of Microfunctions and pseudo-differential equations (Sato 1973) published
 in 1973. It is in this context that the work of Kermack and McCrea can be formal-

 ized as we explain in Sect. 9.3. For more details on the work of Sato and Kashiwara

 see Andronikof (2007), Schapira (2003, 2007, 2009). In a parallel development, rings
 of differential operators with polynomial (rather than holomorphic) coefficients were
 also being studied by Bernstein (1971, 1972) in the USSR.

 Although originally developed in the cradle of partial differential equations,
 the scope of algebraic analysis widened to include representation theory. Indeed, in the

 1980s it provided one of the key ingredients in the solution of the the Kazhdan-Lusztig

 conjecture in the representation theory of Lie algebras (see Beilinson and Bernstein

 1 98 1 ; Brylinski and Kashi wara 1 98 1 ). In this context one of the key results of the the-

 ory is the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, which is one of the latest developments

 in a subject that goes back to the work of Gauss and Riemann on the hypergeometric
 function and includes such classics as Fuch's work on equations with regular singu-

 larities and Hubert's twenty first problem (see Gray 2000, Chaps. I and II; Borei et al.
 (1987)).

 9.3 Kermack-McCrea and algebraic analysis

 In this article we give a rough sketch of the local theory of microdifferential operators

 and explain how the results in the papers of Kermack and McCrea can be formalized

 in the context of this theory. As usual, we consider only the one dimensional case. In

 this section we will follow the modern convention of setting p = d/dq, rather than
 -3/dq as Kermack and McCrea do.

 Let q, p be coordinates in the cotangent bundle T*C = C x C, and consider the

 open set of those points T*C for which p ^ 0. We will work at the neighbourhood of a

 point in this open set which, without loss of generality, we can assume to be z = (0, 1).
 A function / = f(q,p), holomorphic in a neighbourhood of z, is p-homogeneous
 of order s if f(q, p) = g(q)ps, where g(q) is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of z.

 An infinite sum F = ^ fs(q, p) of p-homogeneous functions is a microdifferential
 operator in a neighbourhood of z if

 (1) there exists a neighbourhood U of z such that fs(q, p) is holomorphic and p-

 homogeneous of order s in U'

 (2) there exists an integer t such that fs = 0 for all s > t'
 (3) there exist constants A and K such that

 'fs'u =sup{|/s(<7,/?)H(<7,p) € U] < A('s'')K^K forali*.

 The set £ of all these operators can be made into a ring. The addition is defined as
 usual, whilst the multiplication of F = ^s fs and G = ^s gs is given by

 f^t k' dpk dqk '

 A generalisation of these definitions to several variables and a proof that if F and G
 belong to £, then so does F o G can be found in Björk (1979, p. 136).

 For this ring to play its intended rôle, the commutation relations of Sect. 6.1 must

 hold amongst its generators. However, by definition,

 p o f(q> p) = /(#> p)p + T" while /to* p)°p = /(#> p)p

 from which the relation poq- qop = l immediately follows. Since, under this
 definition, p plays the part of the operator d/dq, from now on we use Ç to denote the

 coordinate of T*C conjugate to q.

 Given an element F = ^s fs e £, it follows from (2) that there exists a largest

 integer m such that fm ^ 0 but fs = 0 for all s > m. This integer is called the order
 of F, and we write cr(F) = fm(q, £)» a polynomial in the commutative variables q

 and f . Using the order we can define a filtration in the ring £. It can now be proved

 that if o-(F)(0, 1) # 0 then F is invertible in £. Recall that inverses were required in
 Part II to prove that every 'function' ofq,p was conjugated to q' see (7.4). A similar
 result holds in £:

 if cr(F) = q, there exists an invertible element A e £ suchthat A oFo A~l = q.

 Let us now turn to contact transformations. First of all, if F = ^ fs and G =
 ]TS g s have orders, respectively, m and n, then the highest order term in F oG - Go F
 is

 3/m dgn dgn Mm
 dp dq dp dq '

 which is equal to the Poisson bracket {/w, gn] = {cr(F), cr(G)}. Suppose now that 4>
 is an isomorphism of £ that preserves operator order; in other words, if F € £ has
 order m, than 4>(F) has order at most m. If $>(q) = Q(q, p) and <&(/?) = P(q, p),
 then

 1 = $>(p o q - q o p) = <&(p) o <ï>(#) - <!>(#) o 3>(/?) = PoQ - QoP.

 Hence,

 1 = a(P o Ô - Ô o P) = {or(P), or(ß)}.

 This implies that the map of C2 defined by 0(#) = cr(Q) and </>(/?) = cr(Q) is a
 contact transformation, as explained in Sect. 3.2. The converse also holds.

 Theorem 9.1 Let f and g be holomorphic functions inq,Ç which are homogeneous

 in Ç and satisfy {/, g} = 1. There exists an order preserving isomorphism O of E such
 that

 Suppose now that 4> is an order preserving isomorphism of £ defined by

 cr($>(q)) = g and cr(&(p)) = f

 4>(F) = AoFoA~'

 for some invertible A e £. Then, using the multiplicativity of or,

 a(<D(F)) = cr(A oFo A"1) = a(A)cr(F)a(A~l) = cr(F),

 since the symbols are commutative polynomials (see Björk 1979, p. 138). In other
 words,

 702 S. C. Coutinho

 if an order preserving isomorphism O is defined by conjugation with an invertible
 element of £ then a(<t>(F)) = cr(F).

 Remarkably, the converse of this result is also true.

 Theorem 9.2 If 0 is an order preserving isomorphism of E for which

 cr(<t>(q)) =cr(q) = q

 then there exists an invertible element A € £ such that O(F) = AoFoA"1.

 Finally, let us turn to Whittaker's theorem on integrals. In order to even state the

 theorem we ought first to explain how a microdifferential operator acts on a holomor-

 phic function. That, however, is neither very natural nor very useful for our purposes.

 Indeed, instead of taking a holomorphic function for the kernel of the integral, the
 modern version of the theorem takes a microfunction defined in terms of Dime's 8.

 For an elementary definition of microfunctions see Coutinho (1995, p. 48ff). Since

 p = -d/dq is surjective as an operator on the space of microfunctions, the integration

 operator can be defined as its inverse. The result we require is the following:

 Let W = W(q, p) be a function and let P = P(q, p) be a microdifferential
 operator. Under certain technical hypothesis on W there exists a microdifferen-
 tial operator Q(q, p) such that

 / P(q, p)8(W(q, t))u(t)dt = J 8(W(q, t))Q(q, p)u(t)àt.

 Conversely, if P is given, a Q can be constructed so that the same equation
 holds. Furthermore, P and Q are operators of the same order.

 For a detailed statement and proof of this result see Kashiwara et al. (1986, p. 221).
 Thus, if we assume that u{t) satisfies Q(q, p)u(t) = 0, then

 0=í P(q, p)8(W(q, t))u(t)dt = P(q, p) (J 8(W(q, t))u(t)dtj

 which is a modern analogue of Whittaker's General Theorem; see Sect. 4.2.

 9.4 A case of missed opportunity?

 In his well-known paper (Dyson 1972), Freeman Dyson introduced the idea of missed

 opportunity, which he defines as

 occasions on which mathematicians and physicists lost chances of making dis-

 coveries by neglecting to talk to each other.

 Whittaker on contact transformations 703

 A quick glance might suggest that the work of Kermack and McCrea fits this defini-

 tion fairly well, if by mathematician we understand 'pure mathematician'; but, is this

 really so? More precisely, had a pure mathematician of the 1930s looked carefully into

 these papers of Kermack and McCrea, could he or she have developed the necessary
 machinery and thus discovered the foundations of algebraic analysis 30 years before

 anyone began to apply modern algebra to linear differential equations? It seems to me

 that so far as this question has an answer, it must be no. Indeed, it is difficult to imag-

 ine algebraic analysis being developed without the aid of cohomology and sheaves, a
 technology that had not been developed at that time (see Houzel 1990, 1998).

 On the other hand, consider the history of the ¿-function. It had been used by
 Heaviside, and was independently introduced by Dirac in 1927, but had to wait for
 L. Schwartz's work on distributions in the 1940s before it was accepted as a bona
 fide mathematical concept. That, however, did not stop physicists from using it, nor

 mathematicians from trying to provide an adequate formalization. The same is true of

 Feynman integrals, which to this day have not been formalized in complete generality.

 Nothing like that happened to the work of Kermack and McCrea. Their anticipation

 of some of the ideas of algebraic analysis was totally forgotten and the developments

 that led to an adequate formalization of what they had in mind was not influenced by
 their work.

 The difference surely lies in the many applications of both the ¿-function and
 Feynman's integral. Physicists realized they were too useful to be put on hold until
 they could be rigorously explained to the mathematicians' content. Nothing similar

 happened to the work of Kermack and McCrea. To a pure mathematician of those times,

 it must have seemed a rather strange sort of thing to study, with its quaint mixture of

 analysis and noncommutative algebra. Moreover, most of the work on noncommuta-

 tive rings before the 1960s was concerned with structure results that would have very

 little to say about the algebra generated by p and q under the relation qp - pq = 1 . On

 top of this, let us not forget that those were the times when algebraic structures were

 most often studied for their own sake, whilst the study of microdifferential operators

 makes very little sense outside the framework of searching for generalised solutions of

 partial differential equations. Finally, their work was presented as a method to handle

 properties of special functions, a subject that, as McCrea (1933) himself points out,
 seemed to have exhausted itself at the time.

 Summing up, although this may seem at first to be a case of missed opportunity,

 a deeper look suggests that it would have been very unlikely for anyone at the time to

 see much of an opportunity in it. There is one final question that we may ask, although
 no answer can be found in the evidence available: had the papers by Kermack and
 McCrea been brought to the attention of the early developers of algebraic analysis,
 would they have influenced them in any way?

 9.5 Conclusion

 In a 'research lecture' that took place in the autumn of 1930 at the University of
 Edinburgh, E. T. Whittaker presented a new method he had devised for com-
 puting certain definite integrals. The method was based on the use of contact

 transformations, a subject dear to Whittaker, who wrote its first presentation in English

 in a chapter of his book Analytical Dynamics. However, Whittaker's proof of his the-

 orem proved to be faulty, and this prompted two of his auditors to attempt to provide a

 correct proof. The team consisted of a chemist (Kermack) and a physicist (McCrea),

 both of whom worked in Edinburgh at the time. Their solution made use of the newly

 invented algebra of quantum mechanics, which turns out to be the noncommutative

 algebra generated by the operators that describe position and momentum in quantum

 dynamics. As part of their attempt they uncovered a number of concepts and results

 that are now part of algebraic analysis: the study of linear partial differential equations

 from the algebro-geometric point of view. Amongst these results, one finds several

 tools of the theory of microdifferential operators, such as:

 • the existence of quantized contact transformations associated to a given contact

 • the fact that some of these transformations can be given as conjugation by appro-

 (canonical) transformation;

 priate invertible operators;

 • the relation between the solutions of two differential equations that are connected

 by a quantized contact transformation.

 These results are presented in the papers Kermack and McCrea (193 la,b), which were

 written in what was by then a very unrigourous language. No hypotheses are made

 concerning the convergence of any of the series that come up in the paper, a prob-

 lem that is compounded by the difficulties inherent in defining convergent series of

 noncommuting operators. Although the authors make clear that they are aware of at

 least some of these problems, they always assume that their results hold as long as the

 required hypotheses are satisfied. That such hypotheses actually exist one has to take

 on trust, for they are never investigated.

 Even though Kermack and McCrea anticipated a few of the ideas that make up the

 present theory of rings of microdifferential operators, there is no evidence that their

 work had any influence in their contemporaries, or at any later time. Remarkable as

 their work is, it does not seem legitimate to argue that it is a case of missed opportunity

 in the sense used by Dyson (1972) for, at the time the papers were published, there was

 no one who could have taken that opportunity. The mathematical technology required

 to carry out the development of the theory would only be created more than 20 years
 later. Moreover, the work was presented in the context of the theory of special func-

 tions, at a moment when the focus in pure mathematics was shifting to general function

 theory. This meant that no other potential applications of these methods were explored,

 so the papers disappeared from view leaving hardly a trace. To complicate matters,

 algebraists were beginning their study of structures in the 1930s, and this mixture of
 noncommutative algebra and analysis, with a touch of Hamiltonian mechanics, did
 not fit the mathematical panorama that the leading mathematicians of those decades

 were composing. So we seem to have, in these early applications of noncommutative

 algebra to linear differential equations, a case of non-mathematicians stumbling upon

 very important results, at a time when these results could not have been derived by

 standard rigorous methods, even at a great cost of time and effort. That caused them to

 be forgotten, until they were rediscovered, in a different context, more than 20 years
 later.
