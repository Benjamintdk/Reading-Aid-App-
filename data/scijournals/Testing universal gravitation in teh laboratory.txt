 Abstract This article seeks to provide a historically well-informed analysis of an

 important post-Newtonian area of research in experimental physics between 1798 and

 1 898, namely the determination of the mean density of the earth and, by the end of the

 nineteenth century, the gravitational constant. Traditionally, research on these matters

 is seen as a case of "puzzle solving." In this article, the author shows that such focus

 does not do justice to the evidential significance of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century

 experimental research on the mean density of the earth and the gravitational constant.

 As Newton's theory of universal gravitation was mainly based on astronomical obser-
 vation, it remained to be shown that Newton's law of universal gravitation did not

 break down at terrestrial distances. In this context, Cavendish' experiment and related

 nineteenth-century experiments played a decisive role, for they provided converging

 and increasingly stronger evidence for the universality of Newton's theory of grav-
 itation. More precisely, the author shall argue that, as the accuracy and precision of
 the experimental apparatuses and the procedures to eliminate external disturbances

 involved increasingly improved, the empirical support for the universality of New-
 ton's theory of gravitation improved correspondingly.

 1 Introduction: measuring gravitational force

 As gravitational forces are very small, gravitational experiments in the laboratory are
 highly susceptible to extraneous disturbances (Cook 1996, pp. 50-51, 70-71; Gillies
 1997, p. 153; Chen and Cook 1993, xii, pp. 5, 34-57). Measuring gravitation in the

 laboratory is therefore far from unproblematic and to the present day this difficulty

 persists.1 Accordingly, it should not come as a surprise that it took well over a cen-

 tury after the publication of the first edition of Newton's Principia (1687) until the

 first precision measurements of gravitation were excogitated and performed. Newton

 himself had been rather sceptical on this matter and in his posthumously published

 De mundi sy sterriate liber (1728) he had suggested that, if two spheres with a diam-

 eter of 1 foot are placed at a distance of 1/4 in. from one other, they would not come

 together by the force of their mutual attraction in less than 1 month.2 Moreover, he

 had noted that a hemispherical mountain of 3 miles high and 6 miles broad, would not

 succeed in drawing a pendulum 2 min from its primary perpendicular.3

 Newton's theory of universal gravitation was well-confirmed at planetary distances

 and, to a significant extent, it was founded on astronomical observations (Kuhn 1996,

 p. 31). In Propositions I- II of Book III, Newton established that the primary planets
 are drawn by an inverse-square centripetal force directed quam proxime towards the
 sun's centre and that the circumsaturnian and circumjovial planets are drawn by an

 inverse-square centripetal force directed quam proxime towards the centre of Saturn

 and Jupiter, respectively (Newton 1999, p. 802).4 This conclusion was warranted by
 astronomical observation, which indicated that the celestial bodies satisfied Kepler's

 area (quam proxime) and harmonic rule (exactly), and by the systematic dependencies

 Newton had established in Propositions I-IV of Book I of the Principia between, on the

 one hand, the presence of an inverse-square law directed quam proxime to the centre of

 the attracting body and the attracted body describing Kepler's area rule quam proxime
 and, on the other hand, between the periodic times varying as the 3/2 power of the

 radius and the centripetal force varying inversely as the square of the radius (Newton

 1999, pp. 444-451). An essential feature of the systematic dependencies Newton had
 established in Book I is that they are rigorously deduced from the laws of motion,

 and thus backed-up by them. In Propositions III-IV of Book III, Newton established
 that the moon is drawn by an inverse-square centripetal force towards the centre of
 the earth. Since astronomical observation shows that the motion of the moon satis-

 fies Kepler's area rule quam proxime, it follows - given the systematic dependency
 between the area rule and the presence of a centripetal force - that the moon is drawn

 by a centripetal force towards the centre of the earth. However, because the moon
 is a solitary satellite, Newton could not use the route via Corollary 6 to Proposition

 1 See Gillies ( 1 997) for further discussion. The precision with which the inverse-square law can be estab-

 lished is about one part in 104, whereas that of the inverse-square law in electrostatics is about one part in
 1016. Chen and Cook (1993, p. 5) comment as follows: "One reason is the very great sensitivity of electrical

 measurements as compared with mechanical measurements, the other is the fact that electrical detectors can

 be completely enclosed within a conducting Faraday cage, whereas it is not possible to build a completely
 enclosed gravitational Faraday cage and still have access to a mechanical detector."

 z See Newton (1728, p. 27): "Hujusmodi globi duo, quarta tantum digiti parte aD invicem distantes, in
 spatiis liberis, haud minori quam mensis unius intervallo, vi mutuae attractionibus accédèrent, ad invicem."
 Newton's calculation is, however, mistaken. See Poynting (1894a, p. 10, 1894b) on this matter.

 3 See Newton (1728, p. 27): "Sed nee montes toti suffecennt ad sensibiles ertectus: Ad radices montis
 hemispaerici alti tria milliaria & lati sex, pendulum vi montis attractum non deviabit scrupulis duobis primis
 a perpendículo."

 4 The author has kept the discussion of Newton's Principia-styie methodology to its bare essentials reternng
 the reader instead to Ducheyne (2009, 2005), Harper (1998, 2002), Smith (2002a,b) for detailed accounts.

 IV of Book I - as he had done in the preceding propositions of Book III. Newton,

 however, showed that, on the assumption of the inverse-square law, the acceleration

 of the moon in the region of the earth comes out equal to Huygens' measurement of

 terrestrial acceleration, which was one of the few direct indications in support of New-

 ton's claim that gravitation was preserved all the way down to the surface of the earth.

 Whilst Propositions I-IV of Book III mainly involved "deductions from phenomena,"

 which were backed-up by the systematic dependencies as established in Book I (and,
 ultimately, by the laws of motion), Propositions V-VIII of Book III explicitly con-
 tained several inductive steps that were guided by Newton's regulae philosophandi.
 The boldest leap, although having some mathematical support in Proposition LXIX of
 Book I, was Newton's generalization of the proportions he had established to bodies
 universally? Newton had done little, except for taking into account the acceleration
 at the surface of the earth in Proposition IV of Book III, on the gravitational forces
 between bodies at smaller distances.6

 It therefore remained to be shown that Newton's law of universal gravitation did
 not break down at smaller distances and in this context Cavendish' experiment and

 related nineteenth-century experiments played a decisive role, for they provided con-

 verging and increasingly stronger evidence for the universality of Newton's theory of

 gravitation.7 From this perspective, several interconnected historical-systematic ques-

 tions emerge: first, how was such converging and increasingly stronger evidence in

 favour of Newton* s theory of universal gravitation established', secondly, what about

 the development of the experimental procedures followed and the characteristics of

 the experimental apparatuses set to use; and, finally, is there is a discernable meth-

 odological-experimental unity in 100 years of experimental research and, if so, what
 does it look like.

 Several elements of Newton's law of universal gravitation can be subjected to
 empirical testing. An experimental physicist may chose to test whether gravitational

 5 Newton was well aware, for instance, that the application of Law III to celestial bodies and bodies
 universally was an inductive generalization. It is worth pointing out that the theory of universal gravitation
 was predicated under the fourth regula philosophandi (Newton 1999, p. 796).

 6 Newton conceived of an experimentům crucis, which involved measuring surface gravity, to decide
 between the theory of universal gravitation and a vortex theory. Newton stated that, on the assumption that

 the earth is an oblate sphere of homogeneous density, surface gravity at the equator results from the combi-

 nation of two effects, namely the centrifugal forces (at the equator) and the gravitational forces arising from

 the inverse-square forces directed towards the individual parts on an oblate earth (Newton 1999, pp. 830-
 831 ; see Greenberg 1995, pp. 1-14, for discussion). By contrast, Christiaan Huygens, who explained gravity

 in mechanical terms, claimed that the earth's centrifugal forces at the equator alone are sufficient to explain

 the different lengths of seconds-pendulums. By consequence, the variation of surface gravity with latitude
 is larger according to Newton's theory than according to Huygens' (Schliesser and Smith forthcoming). It
 was only in the eighteenth century, however, that the matter was settled in favour of universal gravitation.

 1 As is widely known, Kuhn (1996, p. 27) stressed that the empirical work undertaken to articulate a para-
 digm theory consists in "resolving some of its residual ambiguities and permitting the solution of problems
 to which it had previously only drawn attention." Conceiving normal science as mere "problem-solving"

 may come at the risk of underestimating the evidential significance of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
 science. Compare: "Exploring the agreement between theory and experiment into new areas or to new limits

 of precision is a difficult, unremitting, and, for many, exciting job. Though its object is neither discovery nor

 confirmation, its appeal is quite sufficient to consume almost the entire time and attention of those physical
 scientist who do quantitative work" (Kuhn 1961, p. 174 [italics added]).

 force really varies inversely proportional to the square of the distance? whether
 gravitational force is indeed proportional to the product of the masses involved
 (Mackenzie 1895, pp. 333-334), whether the constitution of the masses makes a dif-

 ference (Mackenzie 1 895, pp. 32 1-323, 326-333), whether it makes a difference when

 the masses are not in vacuo (Austin and Thwing 1897), whether the law of universal
 gravitation holds at smaller distances than celestial ones, and what the value for G is

 {and, even, whether G is really constant) (Chen and Cook 1993, p. 2). The eighteenth-

 and nineteenth-century experimental work, which will be surveyed in what follows,

 set out to test the last two of these research questions.

 To conclude this introduction, the author shall dedicate some words on the structure

 of this article. From the late eighteenth century onwards, quantification, standardiza-

 tion, accuracy, and precision measurement became increasingly salient (Hankins 1985,
 p. 50; Home 2003, pp. 371-374; Frängsmyr et al. 1990; Wise 1995). When Henry
 Cavendish (1731-1810), who according to Russell McCormmach was "the first after
 Newton to possess mathematical and experimental talents at all comparable to New-
 ton's," (DSB, III, 195) was nearly 67, he published what would become his last sub-

 stantial scientific article:9 "Experiments to Determine the Density of the Earth," which

 in 1798 appeared in volume 88 of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society

 of London - in fact, the only journal in which he published (Jungnickel and McCorm-

 mach 2001 , p. 169). Despite popular thinking to the contrary, Cavendish never saw his

 experiment as an attempt to measure the gravitational constant. He worked entirely

 within a mathematical framework based on proportions, whereas the concept of a con-

 stant of universal gravitation can only be conceived within a mathematical framework

 of equations and absolute measurements.10 That Cavendish tried to measure "big G"
 is therefore a textbook anachronism (Moreno Gonzales 2001; Falconer 1987; Lally

 1999; Jungnickel and McCormmach 2001, p. 444, footnote 87). Unfortunately, the

 myth of Cavendish and G has persisted, not only in physics textbooks, but also in the
 scholarly literature (Kuhn 1996, pp. 27-28; Baigre 1995, pp. 113-116). In addition
 to addressing the issue alluded to in its title, Cavendish' (1798) article provided a

 measurement of the gravitational interaction between laboratory-sized bodies. Caven-
 dish' article will be discussed in detail in Sect. 2. In nineteenth century physical

 experimental practice, information on the probable error of an experimental result,
 the stability of the experimental environment, and the exclusion of external distur-
 bances became all the more important (Gooday 1997; Schaffer 1995; Olesko 1995).
 In Sects. 3 and 4, nineteenth-century post-Cavendish experiments will be discussed

 8 This was first explicitly tested in 1895 by Mackenzie (1895, pp. 334-339; Cook 1988, pp. 717-718),
 who showed that no deviations from Newton's inverse-square law occurred. Recent experimental research
 has confirmed this result. For example, in 2001 at the University of Washington Newton's inverse-square
 law was tested down to 218 u. m using a metal ring, suspended from a torsion pendulum, and containing ten
 equally spaced holes. No deviations occurred during this ingenious experiment (Hoy le et al. 2001).

 9 In 1 809 Cavendish ( 1 92 1 , II, pp. 287-293) published one more article on a manner of improving the divi-
 sion of astronomical instruments (Cavendish 1921, II, pp. 287-293). Cavendish (1798) article is reproduced
 in Cavendish (1921, II, pp. 249-286.)

 10 Cornu and Baille (Cornu and Bailie 1873, p. 957) (see infra) seem to have been one of the first physi-
 cists who insisted on a determination of G in absolute terms: "Nous avons donc commencé par une étude

 complète de la balance de torsion, surtout au point de vue des mesures absolues"

 and analysed. In the early to mid-nineteenth century, Cavendish' quest for the mean

 density of the earth continued as new experimental setups, apparatuses and physico-
 mathematical treatments were excogitated to solve the issue at stake. An overview
 of these researches will be provided in Sect. 3, in which the work of Baily, Reich,

 Cornu and Bailie, Airy, Sterneck, Jolly and Wilsing will be discussed. During the late

 nineteenth century, the quest for the density of the earth would ultimately lead to the

 introduction of the gravitation constant G.11 An overview of these researches will be

 provided in Sect. 4, in which the experimental work of Poynting, Boys, Braun, and
 Richarz and Krigar-Menzel will be discussed. In Sect. 5, the author shall, on the basis

 of the historical material surveyed in the previous sections, develop an account of the

 evidential significance of this long-term episode in the history of science. In the final

 Sect. 6, the author shall conclude this essay by clarifying the relationship between the
 post-Newtonian experimental methodology, which we have surveyed in Sects. 2-4,
 and that of Newton.

 The apparatus

 The apparatus set to use in Cavendish' famous experiment was a refinement of an
 apparatus originally contrived by John Micheli (1724-1793),12 who "did not com-
 plete the apparatus till a short time before his death, and did not live to make any
 experiment with it."13 After his death it came into the hands of the Jackonian Pro-

 fessor at Cambridge, Francis John Hyde Wollaston (DSB9 XIV, pp. 484-486), who,
 Cavendish wrote, "not having conveniences for making experiments with it, in the
 manner he could wish, was so good as to give it to me" (Cavendish 1798, p. 469;
 Jungnickel and McCormmach 2001, pp. 441-442). Figure 1 shows a longitudinal ver-
 tical section through the apparatus and the room, GGHHGG, in which it was placed.
 Cavendish' description of the experimental setup is to be found in Cavendish (1798,
 pp. 469^73). 14

 1 1 Determining G accurately is quite difficult since it involves the absolute measurements of time, distance
 and mass (Chen and Cook 1993, p. 197).

 12 Micheli and Cavendish's cooperation is discussed in McCormmach (1968). On Micheli, see: Hardin

 (1966), Schaffer (1979), Gower (1982); DSB, IX, pp. 370-371. McCormmach's forthcoming biography of
 Micheli, Weighing the World: The Reverend John Micheli ofThornhill, will be a welcome addition to the
 scholarly literature on Micheli.

 3 No draft material connected to Cavendish' famous experiment has surfaced so far (McCormmach 1 995,

 p. 22).

 14 Useful discussion of the Cavendish experiment is to be found in Titchmarsh (1966), McCormmach
 (1995, 1998), Falconer (1999a), and Jungnickel and McCormmach (2001, pp. 440-450). However, it must
 be noted that most of the above accounts are not very detailed when it comes to the specifics of Cavendish'

 calculations. In discussing Cavendish' results, the author shall preserve his original mathematical reasoning,
 which appears somewhat archaic in comparison to our contemporary tools of mathematical computation:
 just as Newton, Cavendish used proportions only.

 In order to guard against sources of error, the room, measuring 10 feet in height and

 as many feet across, remained shut throughout the experiment and the effects were
 observed from outside of the room by means of telescopes (7) and lamps (L), which

 were installed at both sides of the room and which pointed to the verniers placed inside

 the case (Cavendish 1798, p. 471).15 In this way, the most significant source of error,

 scilicet variation of temperature, could be guarded against significantly, according to
 Cavendish (1798, p. 471). Two leaden balls x and jc, which have a diameter of about
 2 in. (or about 5.08 cm), were suspended by the wires hx from the arm ghmh which
 is itself suspended by the slender wire gl with a length of about 40in. (or 1.016m).
 Given the fact that the wire is sufficiently slender, "the most minute force, such as the

 attraction of a leaden weight a few inches in diameter, will be sufficient to draw the
 arm sensibly aside" (Cavendish 1798, p. 469). Cavendish (1798, p. 470) computed
 that the force by which the balls are attracted in proportion to their weights is as 1 to
 50,000,000. To determine the force by which the balls and the arm are drawn against

 the restoring force of the twisted wire, the arm was placed in such a way so as to enable
 it to move freely as a "horizontal pendulum." The arm ghmh, measuring 6 feet (or
 roughly 1 .83 m) consisted of a slender deal rod hmh strengthened by a silver wire hgh,
 which "is made strong enough to support the balls, though very light" (Cavendish

 15 Jungnickel and McCormmach (2001) note that in these experiment Cavendish "brought the earth into
 his place of privacy, his home [in an outhouse of Clapham Common], where he experimented on it on
 his own." On Cavendish' personality traits, see Jungnickel and McCormmach (2001, pp. 303-309); on
 Clapham Common, see Jungnickel and McCormmach (2001, pp. 324-331).

 1798, p. 472). 16 The two lead balls x and x are placed in the narrow wooden case
 ABCDDCBAEFFE, which is set horizontally and which is supported by posts fixed

 firmly in the ground to which it is attached to by four screws (S).17 The wooden case

 served to protect the arm from air currents. FK represents a wooden rod, which, by
 means of an endless screw, turns around the support and to which the slender wire
 gl is fastened. By means of FK Cavendish could manipulate the position of the arm

 ghmh from outside till the arm settles in the required position without any danger of

 touching either side of the case. The wire gl is fastened to its support at the top and

 to the centre of the arm at the bottom by brass clips in which it is pinched by screws.
 Two lead weights W and W are suspended from the copper rods Pr and rR and the
 wooden bar rr, which was in-between the rods. This devise was attached to the centre

 pin Pp which was attached to the ceiling HH of the room and placed above the centre

 of the apparatus. To Pp the pulley, MM, around which the cord Mm was attached so

 that one can alter the position of the weights W and W from outside. Figure 2 depicts
 a view from above of the instrument.

 When the weights W and W were in the first position - indicated by full lines -

 they conspired in drawing the arm in the direction hW' when the weights are in the

 second position - indicated by dotted lines - they attracted the arm in the contrary
 direction hw. As in the second position the arm was drawn aside in such a direction as

 to make the index point to a higher number on the ivory slips, Cavendish considered

 this as the "positive position of the weights." The weights W and W were furthermore

 prevented from striking the instrument by pieces of wood, fastened to the wall of the
 room, which stop the weights as soon as they come within one fifth of an inch (or
 0.508 cm) of the case. Cavendish found that "the weights may strike against them

 16 In an accompanying footnote, Cavendish pointed out that this setup is easier to construct, meets less air

 resistance and involves less complicated computations to ascertain how much the rod was attracted by the
 weights.

 1 7 In Fig. 1 , the longitudinal vertical section of the apparatus, only two of the four screws are depicted. All
 four screws are depicted on Fig. 2 (see infra). Cavendish noted that the box in which the balls are moved
 is pretty deep "which makes the effect of the current of air more sensible than it would otherwise be, and

 is a defect which I intend to rectify in some future experiments" (Cavendish 1798, p. 497).

 with considerable force, without sensibly shaking the instrument" (Cavendish 1798,

 p. 473 [italics added]). Moreover, "[i]n order to determine the situation of the arm"

 (Cavendish 1798, p. 473), slips of ivory, which were divided to a twentieth of an inch

 (or 1.27 mm), were place within the case, as near to each end of the arm as could be

 possibly done without touching them. To the original slips on each side a nonius was

 added, which in its turn was divided into five parts so that the position of the arm could
 be measured to one 100th of an inch (i.e. to 0.254 mm). Once the arm is set to rest and

 its position was observed, Cavendish (1798, 474) moved the weights W and W closer
 to the balls x and x so that "the arm will not only be drawn aside thereby, but it will

 be made to vibrate, and its vibrations will continue for a great while."

 Attempts to determine the density of the earth were undertaken prior to Cavendish'

 experiment with the torsion rod. A well-tried method consisted in measuring the deflec-

 tion of a plumb line in the vicinity of a large mountain.18 This was the method which
 was used in Nevil Maskelyne's (1732-181 1) famous experiment at Mount Schiehal-
 lion in Scotland.19 In a short but acutely written article, Jacob (1813-1862) pointed
 out that "the Cavendish experiment is the one which may be relied on as giving a

 good approximation to the truth, within limits or error (when conducted with proper
 precaution)" (Jacob 1857, p. 295). In the Cavendish experiment "we are dealing with
 disturbing masses whose amount is exactly known," whereas in the method promoted

 by Hutton "we may approximately measure the mass of the mountain above the sur-
 face, we do not know how much may be added or abstracted below; and we have no

 right to assume that the mountain is merely a detached mass resting upon the general

 surface; it will almost certainly have roots differing in density from the surrounding

 country" (Jacob 1857, pp. 297-298 [underscore added]).

 Measurements and their computation

 After having provided the description of the experimental setup, Cavendish explained

 how he was about to determine the point of rest of a vibration and the time of vibration.

 To establish the point of rest, it was necessary "to observe the extreme points of the

 vibrations, and from thence to determine the point which it would rest at if its motion

 was destroyed, or the point of rest, as I shall call it" (Cavendish 1798, p. 474). To do
 so, Cavendish (1798, p. 474) observed three successive extreme points of a vibration
 and took the mean between the first and third of these extremes, as the extreme point of

 18 This method seems to have been tried for the first time by Pierre Bouguer (1698-1758) Bouguer (1749,

 pp. 372-373). See furthermore: Howarth (2007b, pp. 230-231). On Bouguer, see DSB, II, pp. 343-344.

 lyne's (and Hutton's) experimental work on the matter (Jungnickel and McCormmach 2001, pp. 259-261).
 See furthermore: Hutton (1779), in which he arrived at a mean density of the earth relative to water of 4.5

 (p. 93), Playfair (1811), which contains a correction of Hutton's value into 4.55886 (p. 374), and Hutton

 Hutton, see DSB, VI, pp. 576-577; on John Playfair, see DSB, I, pp. 34-36. The same method was again
 used in 1856 (James 1856), which arrived at a value of 5.417 ± 0.054. On Maskelyne's, Hutton's and

 tions are continually diminishing," he observed, "it is evident, that the mean between

 two extreme points will not give the true point of rest."20 He then determined the time

 of vibration by observing the two extreme points of a vibration and the times at which

 the arm arrived at two given divisions between the extremes, which were on different

 sides of the middle point and not very far from it. From the above, he computed the

 middle point of the vibration and, by proportion, the time at which the arm comes to

 this middle point. After a number of vibrations he repeated this procedure and divided

 the interval of time, between the arrival of the arm to the two middle points, by the

 number of vibrations, which gives the time of one vibration.21 "To judge the property

 of this method," on must consider "in what manner the vibration is affected by the

 resistance of the air, and by the motion of the point of rest" (Cavendish 1798, p. 476).

 Cavendish, however, argued that in both cases the effect will be inconsiderable. First,

 "as the time of coming to the middle point is before the middle of the vibration, both

 in the first and last vibration, and in general is nearly so, the error produced from this

 cause must be inconsiderable." Secondly, insofar as the point of rest can be considered

 as moving uniformly, the time of two successive vibrations "will be very little altered;

 and, therefore the time of moving from the middle point of one vibration to the middle

 point of the next, will also be very little altered" (Cavendish 1798, pp. 476-477). It is

 relevant to note that Cavendish was a careful observer who was very knowledgeable of

 the calibration of scientific instruments - in fact, he was very active at times when the

 instruments of The Royal Society were being calibrated22 - and "in his experimental
 work he showed a thorough understanding of the theory of errors" (Jungnickel and
 McCormmach 2001, p. 149, 174).

 "The" Cavendish experiment is in fact a concatenation of 17 related experiments.23
 The specific determinations of the motions of the arm and the times of vibration in

 each of these experiments will not be discussed: The author shall restrict himself to

 a discussion of the obtained results, which Cavendish summarized on page 520 of
 his article, and their computation. The third and fifth column contain the distances

 traversed by the arm and the times of vibration as found in the 17 foregoing experi-

 ments (see Fig. 3). The second column shows the starting positions of the arm and the
 directions in which it was moved.

 20 In addition, Cavendish pointed out the following: "It may be thought more exact, to observe many
 extreme points of vibration, so as to find the point of rest by different sets of three extremes, and to take the

 mean result; but it must be observed, that notwithstanding the pains taken to prevent any disturbing force,

 the arm will seldom remain perfectly at rest for an hour together; for which reason, it is best to determine

 the point of rest, from observations made as soon after the motion of the weights as possible." (Cavendish
 1798, p. 474).

 2 1 Cavendish ( 1 798, p. 478) notes that the error in the result is much less, when the forces required to draw

 the arm aside was deduced from experiments made at each experiment, than when it is taken from previous
 experiments.

 22 See for instance Cavendish's unpublished piece "Boiling Point of Water, At the Royal Society, April 1 8,
 1766" (in Cavendish 1921, II, pp. 351-345) and Cavendish (1776). For further discussion, see Jungnickel
 and McCormmach (2001, pp. 220-224).

 23 These were performed in 1797 on 6, 7, 12, and 20 August, 6, 18, and 23 September and in 1798 on 29
 April, 5, 6, 9, 25-28, and 30 May. The article was read shortly afterwards, i.e. on 21 June 1798.

 What will be discussed, however, are the ways the experiments differed and the

 procedures by which external forces were singled out. In the first three experiments,
 Cavendish (1798, p. 478) used a copper silvered wire, which, as he soon found out,
 was not stiff enough so that "the attraction of the weights drew the balls so much
 aside, as to make them touch the sides of the case." However, he decided to make

 some experiments with it. In order to make sure that the vibrations were not produced

 by magnetism, he changed the iron rods, by which the leaden weights were suspended,

 for copper ones, and a result of this it turned out that "there still seemed to be some
 effect of the same kind, but more irregular, so that I attributed it to some accidental

 cause, and therefore hung on the leaden weights, and proceeded with the experiments"
 (Cavendish 1798, p. 479). Furthermore, Cavendish observed that:

 if a wire is twisted only a little more than its elasticity admits of, then, instead of

 setting, as it is called, or acquiring a permanent twist all at once, it sets gradually,

 and, when it is left at liberty, it gradually loses part of that set which it acquired;

 so that if, in this experiment, the wire, by having been kept twisted for 2 or 3 h,

 had gradually yielded to this pressure, or had begun to set, it would gradually

 restore itself, when left at liberty, and the point of rest would gradually move

 backwards; but, though the experiment was repeated twice, I could not perceive
 any such effect. (Cavendish 1798, p. 485)

 In the experiments made thereafter, he replaced the original wire by a stiffer one.

 In the fourth experiment, Cavendish observed that, although, as in the previous exper-

 iments, on moving the weights from positive to negative the effect of the weights

 increased on standing, the effect diminished on moving them from negative to positive.

 He then determined whether the balls or weights could have acquired polarity from the

 earth's magnetic field or whether magnets placed in the vicinity of the case could alter
 the observed effects (fifth experiment) (Cavendish 1798, pp. 490-491). Upon closer

 scrutiny, these putative causes indicated no significant difference, according to Caven-

 dish. He found, however, that differences in temperature did make a difference (sixth
 to ninth experiment) (Cavendish 1798, pp. 496-497). Next, he compared the results
 when starting the experiment with the index placed very closely to the case without

 touching it (ninth to eleventh experiment), with the index in its usual position (12th to

 14th experiment), and with the index placed very closely to the case without touching,

 but now in the opposite direction (15th experiment). Two additional experiments con-
 cluded the observations which Cavendish provided to support his case. Cavendish'

 experiments provided information about two important values: the motion of the arm

 and the time of its vibrations. In the following paragraph, we will see how he came

 up with an ingenious way to determine the density of the earth relative to the density
 of water in terms of the observed values for the motions of the arm and the time of

 vibration - in the remainder of his article, these terms were denoted by B and N,

 respectively.

 Determining the density of the earth

 Cavendish' computation of the earth's density assumed "that the arm and copper rods

 have no weight, and that the weights exert no sensible attraction, except on the nearest

 ball." He added that he would examine "what corrections are necessary, on account of

 the arms and rods, and some other small causes" (Cavendish 1798, p. 509). Cavendish

 first determined the force required to draw the arm aside, which is determined by the

 time of a vibration. He treated the motion of the arm as a horizontal pendulum which
 he compared to the motion of a regular (vertical) pendulum. This is a crucial feature

 of the experiment's setup: because the balls are set in a plane orthogonal to the direc-

 tion of the earth's gravitational field, Cavendish succeeded in eliminating gravitation's
 downward pull from the experiment considerably. As the distance between the centres
 of the two balls, x and W, is 73.3 in., the distance of each from the centre of motion

 is 36.65 in. Moreover, the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds "in this region" is
 39. 14 in. Therefore,

 if the stiffness of the wire by which the arm is suspended in such, that the force

 which must be applied to each ball, in order to draw the arm aside by the angle

 A, is to the weight of that ball as the arch of A to the radius,24 the arm will

 vibrate in the same time as a pendulum whose length is 36.65, that is, in J ^^

 s,25 and therefore, if the stiffness of the wire is such as to make it vibrate in N

 seconds, the force which must be applied to each ball, in order to draw it aside

 by an angle A, is to the weight of the ball as the arch ofAx^x 3^ to the
 radius [(*)]26. (Cavendish 1798, p. 509)

 As the ivory scale at the end of the arm is 38.3 in. away from the centre of motion

 and each division is ¿ of an inch from the centre of motion, it subtends an angle

 at the centre whose arch is ^ LQ- q8q5 m • ®v fiUin8 m A in (*), the forces which
 must be applied to each ball to draw the m ball aside by one division, is to the weight

 of the ball as 7^¡^9H9 that is as 'mW1 to 1 (**)• Secondly> li is required to find
 "the proportion which the attraction of the weight bears to that of the earth thereon,

 supposing the ball to be place in the middle of the case, that is, to be not nearer to one

 side than the other" (Cavendish 1798, p. 510). At this point, Cavendish introduced a
 correction factor. He observed that, "[w]hen the weights are approached to the balls,

 their centres are 8.85 in. from the middle line of the case; but, through inadvertence,

 the distance, from each other, of the rods which support these weights, was made equal

 to the distance of the centres of the balls from each other, whereas it ought to have been

 somewhat greater."27 As a consequence of this, the effect of the weights in drawing the
 arm aside is less than it would otherwise have been, to wit, in a ratio of 0.9779 to I.28

 Each of the weights weighed 24,390,000 grains or roughly 158 kg,29 which is equal

 to the weight of 10.64 spherical feet of water, i.e. equal to the weight of 10.64 times

 the volume of a sphere of water with a diameter of 1 foot. The radius of one spherical

 feet of water is therefore 6 in., as 1 foot equals 12 in. Therefore, the attraction of a

 weight on a particle placed at the centre of a ball at 8. 85 in. from the centre ofthat

 weight is to the attraction of a spherical foot of water on an equal particle placed on

 its surface as 10.64 x 0.9779 x (3^5) to 1. Furthermore, the mean diameter of the
 earth is 41,800,000 feet and, therefore, if the mean density of the earth is to that of

 24 What Cavendish is stating here is equivalent to saying that the force restoring the pendulum's motion
 (FT) to the vertical through an angle A is to the weight of the ball times sin(A) (Falconer 1999a, p. 475a).

 25 As in this case ¿L is proportional to ^, it follows that yJ^ is proportional to ¿L. If x' is 36.65 in.,

 JC2 is 39. 14 in. and t' is 1, it follows that ij is proportional to J^ or, from what is given, proportional to

 26 Insertion added. This is equivalent with saying that the force exerted on the balls (Fe) swinging along a

 simple pendulum is to the restoring force (Fr ) as ^j . Because the restoring force is proportional to the weight

 of the ball (W^) times sin(A) (see supra), Fe/ W'> is proportional to sin(A) x ^ or tosin(A) x ^1 x -Xj.

 27 Baily (1843, p. 89) pointed out that "yet it would have been more satisfactory to have known that no
 alteration in that distance was perceptible during the whole of the series."

 28 This step follows from basic geometry. Since it is neatly described and illustrated in Mackenzie (1895,

 p. 89), footnote *, the author will omit further discussion of this step.

 Although Cavendish did not make this point explicit, this conclusion relied on
 Newton's law of universal gravitation.32 Let Fw be the weight of W on ball x, Fe

 the weight of the earth on ball jc, and Fh2o the weight of the water sphere and let
 the diameters (d), densities (p) and radiuses (r) be represented similarly. The ratio

 established that the force required to draw the arm through one division of 2.54 in. is

 to the weight of the ball as 1 to 818 N2 (**). By dividing (**) and (***), we establish

 that the attraction of a weight on a ball is to the force required to draw the arm through

 one division 2.54 in. as N2 to 10,683 D, from which it follows that the density of the

 earth relative to the density of water, D, is given as 1Q^83g, where B is the number of
 divisions in hundredths of an inch and N is the observed period in seconds. By adding

 correction factors (1) and (4), which are discussed in the next paragraph, to the above

 formula, Cavendish corrected 1Q^83g to ^^44^ and by this proportion he arrived at
 the values in column 7 in the table on Fig. 3 (Cavendish 1798, p. 517).

 Before Cavendish proceeded to compute the value of the density of the earth rela-

 tive to the density of water on the basis of the values of N and B he had established in

 his experiments, Cavendish provided six correction factors:

 [F]irst, for the effect which the resistance of the arm to motion has on the time

 of the vibration: 2d, for the attraction of the weights on the arm: 3d, for their

 attraction on the farther ball: 4th, for the attraction of the copper rods on the
 balls and arm: 5th, for the attraction of the case on the balls and the arm: and

 6th, for the alteration of the attraction of the weights on the balls, according to
 the position of the arm, and the effect which that has on the time of vibration.

 None of these corrections, indeed, except the last, are of much signification, but

 they ought not entirely be neglected. (Cavendish 1798, p. 51 1)

 30 Therefore D is proportional to the density of the earth divided by the density of water. As will be denoted

 here' D = pfe» or more succinctly, P(e/H2O)-

 31 Charles Hutton (1821, p. 287) correctly pointed out that the ratio should have been 1 to 8,740,000
 instead.

 32 Cf. Falconer (1999a, p. 475b). In his manuscripts, which are preserved at the Duke of Devonshire's
 (Derbyshire) library in Chatsworth House, Cavendish did not seems to written anything on the specifics
 of Newton's methodology (personal communication with Russell McCormmach, 19 March 2010). On the
 status of theories in Cavendish' work and that of his contemporaries, see McCormmach (McCormmach
 2004, Chapter 3, pp. 49-77).

 Cavendish computed that, ( 1 ) if the time of a vibration is given, the force required to

 draw the arm aside is greater than if the arm had no weight, namely in a proportion of

 1 1,660 to 1 1,262, i.e. ca. 1.0353 to 1 (first correction factor: the resistance of the arm

 to motion; Cavendish 1798, pp. 512-513), (2) that the power of the weight to move the

 arm, by means of its attraction on the nearest part of it, is 0.0139 of its attraction on

 the ball (second correction factor: the attraction of the weight on the arm; Cavendish

 1798, pp. 513-514),33 (3) that the effect of the attraction of the weight on both balls,

 is to that of its attraction on the nearest ball as 0.9983 to 1 (third correction factor:

 the attraction on the farther ball; Cavendish 1798, p. 515), (4) that the attraction of

 the weight and copper rod on the arm and both balls together is to the attraction of the

 weight on the nearest ball as 1.0199 to 1 (fourth correction factor: the attraction of

 the copper rods on the balls and arms; Cavendish 1798, p. 515), (5) that the attraction

 of the case on the balls cannot exceed j-J^q part of the weight and that the whole force
 is "so small as not to be worth regarding" (fifth correction factor: the attraction of the
 case and the balls and the arm; Cavendish 1798, p. 515-517), and, finally, (6a) that

 "[i]f the time of vibration is determined by an experiment in which the weights are in

 near position, and the motion of the arm, by moving the weights from the near to the

 midway position, is d divisions, the observed time must be diminished in [. . .] in the

 ratio of 1 - -jI^ to I,"34 (6b) that in order to correct "the motion of the arm caused by
 moving the weights from a near to the midway positioner the reverse, observe how

 much the position of the arm differs from 20 divisions, when the weights are in the

 near position: let this be n divisions, then, if the arm at that time is on the same side of

 the division of 20 as the weight, the observed motion must be diminished by the ^

 part of the whole; but otherwise, it must be as much increased,"35 and (6c) that "[i]f

 the weights are moved from one near position to the other, and the motion of the arm

 is Id divisions, the observed motion must be diminished by the ^ part of the whole"
 (sixth correction factor: the effect of the alternation of the attraction; Cavendish 1798,

 p. 519 [italics added]).36

 Given the formula which Cavendish had obtained to calculate the density of the

 earth relative to the density of water, D = 1O^83B, where AT is the (possibly corrected)
 time of vibration expressed in seconds and B the (possibly corrected) motion of the

 arm expressed in twentieths of an inch, he could compute D as inferable from each

 experiment. The results of these computations are to be found in column 7 of the table

 depicted in Fig. 3. In the concluding section to his article, Cavendish recorded:

 From this table it appears, that though the experiments agree pretty well together,

 yet the difference between them, both in the quantity of motion of the arm and
 in the time of vibration, is greater than can proceed merely from the error of

 33 Cavendish (1798, p. 514) furthermore noted: "It must be observed, that the effect of the attraction of

 the weight on the whole arm is rather less than this, as its attraction on the farther half draws it the contrary
 way; but, as the attraction on this is small, in comparison of its attraction on the nearer half, it may be
 disregarded."

 observation. As to the difference in the motion of the arm, it may very well be

 accounted for, from the current of air produced by the difference of temperature;

 but, whether this account for the difference in the time of vibration, is doubtful.

 If the current of air was regular, and of the same swiftness in all parts of the

 vibration of the ball, I think it could not; but as there will most likely be much

 irregularity in the current, it may very likely be sufficient to account for the
 difference. (Cavendish 1798, p. 521)

 Next, he derived an average of 5.4837 for the density of the earth relative to the

 density of water and noted that "the extreme results do not differ from the mean by

 more than,38, or 1/14 of the whole, and therefore the density should seem to be deter-

 mined, to great exactness" (Cavendish 1798, p. 521). By doing do, he had succeeded in
 determining a previously "imponderable quantity" (Hacking's terminology; Hacking
 1983, p. 236). Thereafter, he warded off two possible objections:

 [ 1 ] It, indeed, may be objected, that as the result appears to be influenced by the current

 of air, or some other cause, the laws of which we are not well acquainted with, this

 cause may perhaps act always, or commonly, in the same direction, and thereby

 make a considerable error in the result. But yet, as the experiments were tried in

 various weathers, and with considerable variety in the differences of temperature

 of the weights and air, and with the arm resting at different distances from the

 sides of the case, it seems unlikely that this cause should act so uniformly in the

 same way, as to make the error of the mean result nearly equal to the difference

 between this and the extreme; and, therefore, it seems unlikely that the density of

 the earth should differ from 5,48 by so much as 1/14 of the whole.

 [2] Another objection, perhaps, may be made to these experiments, namely that it is

 uncertain whether, in these small distances, the force of gravity follows exactly

 the same law as in greater distances. There is no reason, however, to think that

 any irregularity of this kind takes place, until the bodies come within the action of

 what is called the attraction of cohesion, and which seems to extend only to very

 minute distances. With a view to see whether the result could be affected by this

 attraction, the author made the 9th, 10th, 1 lth, and 15th experiments, in which the

 balls were made to rest as close to the sides of the case as they could; but there
 is no difference to be depended on, between the results under that circumstance,

 and when the balls are placed in any other part of the case. (Cavendish 1798,
 pp. 521-522 [numbering and italics added])

 Finally, when pointing to the discrepancy between his own result and that obtained

 by Maskelyne, Cavendish (Cavendish 1798, p. 522) concluded his article with the
 words: "But I forbear entering into any consideration of which determination is most

 to be depended on, till I have examined more carefully how much the preceding deter-
 mination is affected by irregularities whose quantities I cannot measure." Cavendish'

 last article was of tremendous importance for "it brought the precision of astronomical

 37 The third value on column 7 on Fig. 3 should have been 5.88 instead of 4.88. As a consequence of this,
 Cavendish' mean result should have been 5.448 (Baily 1843, p. 90). Interestingly, in Proposition X of Book
 III, Newton had noted that "it is likely that the total amount of matter in the earth is about five or six times

 greater than it would be if the whole earth consisted of water" (Newton 1999, p. 815).

 observation down to earth, to experimental science" (Jungnickel and McCormmach

 2001, p. 450). By means of his experiment, Cavendish had not merely determined the

 mean density of the earth, more importantly, he had provided a test for the universality

 of Newton's theory: he had shown that the law of universal gravitation holds "in these

 small distances" and, hereby, he had provided evidence that the law of universal grav-

 itation holds at smaller distances than celestial ones. Obviously, he did not provide a
 test for the gravitational inverse-square law (Lauginie 2007, pp. 126-127). In short,
 he had demonstrated that robust gravitational interactions occur between terrestrial
 bodies.

 3 Post-Cavendish determinations of the density of the earth

 The publication of Cavendish' article on the mean density of the earth, drew scholarly

 attention in Europe, particularly in England, Germany and France. Accounts of Caven-
 dish' experiment were soon published in German in 1799 and again in 1827 (Gilbert
 1799; Muncke 1827),39 and in 1815 a complete French translation of Cavendish'
 original article appeared (Chompré 1815). Occasionally, his results were contested,
 as will be shown in what follows.40 Most scientific attention, however, was devoted

 to improving Cavendish' results, i.e. to excogitating more reliable measurement tech-

 niques, to constructing variant and different experimental apparatuses, which suffered

 less from external disturbances than Cavendish' original torsion rod,41 and to intro-
 ducing new idealizations*2 of the phenomena under consideration.43 In addition to

 torsion and plumb-line experiments, new methods for determining the density of the

 earth were established during the early nineteenth century: most notably, by means

 of a regular pendulum,44 by comparing the swings of pendulums near and below the

 air currents. See the discussion in Galison (1987, pp. 2-3).

 the first editor of the journal, Gilbert, had praised the experimental results in Cavendish (1798) article for
 their exactness (Jungnickel and McCormmach 2001, p. 456). In 1806 Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes (1777-
 1834) derived a variant formula to establish the time of oscillation more precisely (1806, p. 301, 310). On

 Brandes, see DSB, II, pp. 420-^21. A useful work on the history of geodesy in Germany is Torge (2009).

 4U In Hutton (1821), Cavendish was accused of several calculation errors. However, much of Hutton s

 criticism was simply mistaken (see Baily 1 843 for ample discussion).

 41 Compare with Baigre's (1995, p. 119) analysis of post-Cavendish experiments in terms of continually
 addressing residual phenomena.

 42 My favourite quote on scientific idealization in the context of the determination of the mean density
 of the earth is the following: "Now none of these methods give the mean density as a direct result; for the
 result obtained, the earth's total attraction, is = g x the sum of (all the particles respectively by the squares

 of their distances) instead of g x (the total mass divided by the square of the radius or mean distance): and

 to assume the equality of these, is to assume the earth to be a sphere, and to have its matter arranged in
 concentric shells or layers of equal density throughout each layer, both of which we know to be untrue"
 (Jacob 1857, p. 296).

 43 In their case-study, Baird and Faust (1990, esp. p. 170, 172) have emphasized that the accumulation of

 scientific instruments and instrumental techniques are important factors for scientific progress.

 44 See Poy nting ( 1 894a, pp. 22-40, 1 894b), for further discussion of particular experiments performed by
 this method, and Howarth (2007a), for discussion of the role of the pendulum in early geophysics.

 surface of the earth, and by means of a common balance.45 Rather than providing a

 complete overview of all nineteenth-century experiments on the determination of the

 density of the earth and G, in this and the following section the author shall provide

 a detailed overview of the most significant developments in these areas of research.

 The author starts his analysis by discussing Cavendish-like torsion experiments.

 Post-Cavendish torsion experiments: 1843-1873

 In 1843 Francis Baily46 (1774-1844) recorded that Cavendish' aim in his 1798 arti-

 cle "appears to have been more for the purpose of exhibiting a specimen of what he

 considered to be an excellent method of determining this important enquiry, than of

 deducing a result that should lay claim to the full confidence of the scientific world"

 (Baily 1843, p. 8).47 He emphasized that Cavendish' results were approximate and
 few in number. For this reason The Royal Society had set out:

 not merely to repeat the original experiments of Cavendish in a somewhat sim-

 ilar manner, but also to extend the investigation by varying the magnitude and

 substance of the attracted balls - by trying the effect of different modes of sus-

 pension - by adopting considerable differences of temperature - and by other

 variations that might be suggested during the progress of enquiry. (Baily 1843,
 p. 10)

 Just as Cavendish had done, Baily performed the experiments in a room of his
 private house - 37 Tavistock Place in London. He introduced an "inverse" Cavendish

 torsion rod and determined the times of vibration and the resting points in a different
 way. Most importantly, whereas Cavendish (and Reich (1838)48) had suspended the
 masses from above and supported the torsion from below, Baily reversed the modus

 operandi. An inverted T-shaped mahogany box, which contained the suspended torsion

 rod, was attached to the ceiling by "a very stout plank." By means of several strong

 iron screw bolts, passing through the ceiling, the plank was made the firm support
 of a triangular wooden frame (see Fig. 4a) (Baily 1843, p. 11). Baily recorded that

 "[t]he whole of the mahogany box is completely insulated from every part of the frame

 work, and from any contact with those portions of the apparatus that are near it. It

 consequently remains undisturbed either by walking about the floor, by working the

 45 Howarth notes: "The first systematic measurements of the force of [sic] Earth's gravity field in the
 eighteenth century began as an essentially geodetic exercise, with the aim of providing an alternative, and

 perhaps more precise, route to defining the Figure of the Earth than that provided by arc-length measure-
 ments. This was accompanied by a keen interest in obtaining a value for the mean density of the Earth"
 (Howarth 2007b, p. 255).

 46 On Baily see Miller ( 1 986) and Ashworth ( 1 994).

 47 Baily refers to Cavendish (1798, p. 522) to back up his claim. An extended abstract of Baily 's (1842)
 article appeared under the same title in Philosophical Magazine.

 In this essay the author shall not go into the details on Reich's first article on the mean density of the

 earth. Reich's second article on the matter will be discussed in what follows.

 masses, or by any other commotion within the room." (Baily 1843, p. 20).49 Below

 the centre of the mahogany box, a solid wooden cross piece was firmly screwed to the

 floor (see Fig. 4b), "on which has been raised a circular frame work, embracing and

 supporting a copper ring; within which ring a large round wooden pillar moves on an
 iron pivot, which bears upon a small metal cup" (Baily 1843, pp. 11-12). On top of
 the pillar, a deal plank was fastened horizontally, which supported two large leaden

 balls or masses, which were firmly fixed onto it:

 The height of this pillar has been so constructed that the centres of the masses

 should be placed in the same horizontal plane (or nearly so) as that intended to

 be the plane of the centres of the small balls alluded to. On the upper surface

 of the plank, and as nearly as possible in the centre of motion, a round piece of

 ivory, about 1 in. in diameter, has been inlaid. The centre of motion having then

 been accurately determined, two black cross lines were so drawn on the ivory

 that their point of intersection always indicated its position. (Baily 1843, p. 12)

 In order to minimize the "influence of any accidental or sudden change of temper-

 ature in the room," (Baily 1843, p. 13) an octagonal wooden frame was built around

 the horizontal portion of the mahogany box and the support of the leaden balls (see

 Fig. 4c). Baily remarked that "[n]othing can exceed the ease, the steadiness, and the
 facility with which these large bodies are moved: and during the many thousands of

 times that they have been turned backwards and forwards, I have never observed the
 least deviation from the most perfect accuracy" (Baily 1843, p. 15).

 Baily experimented with small balls of six different materials (platinum, lead, zinc,
 glass, ivory, and hollow brass) and diameters and he used different modes of sus-
 pension of the torsion rod, "one by means of a single copper wire, as practiced by
 Cavendish and Reich; the other by means of double lines, as proposed by Gauss
 in magnetic experiments" (Baily 1843, p. 26) and torsion wires of varying length and
 material (silk, brass, iron) (Baily 1843, pp. 24-31). With respect to the support to

 which the suspension lines, Baily recorded:

 Before I close this account of the suspension lines, I cannot but advert to the

 firmness and stability of the support to which they were attached. In order to

 49 The torsion box was furthermore lined with tin foil, which was connected with a copper wire that

 communicated with the ground for the purpose of carrying off any slight electricity that might exist in the
 box (Baily 1843, p. 19).

 satisfy myself on the requisite point, at the time of the original construction
 of the apparatus, I made various attempts to create a sensible disturbance in

 the motion of the torsion rod, by causing the doors to be frequently and vio-

 lently slammed - by jumping heavily on the floor of the room - and also above

 the ceiling - and in other different ways, having a similar tendency: but, in no

 instance could I observe the least effect upon the lateral motion of the rod. I have

 also frequently tried the same experiment, when different visitors were present,

 since the apparatus has been completed: and have moreover many times not only

 accidentally, but also designedly, made a regular series of experiments for deter-

 mining the Density of the Earth, during the most violent storms that I have ever

 witnessed, when the wind has been so boisterous, and blowing in such gusts,
 that the house has been shaken to its centre. But in no instance have I ever seen

 the least disturbance in the lateral motion of the torsion rod, nor any difference

 produced in the results of the experiments. [. . .] But a moment's consideration
 will convince a person conversant with the subject, that no dancing motion of

 the suspension line, even if it did exist, would tend to produce an irregular lateral

 or angular motion in the torsion rod; and this is the only anomalous motion we
 need guard against.50 There is also another remarkable circumstance with this

 subject, which I think it requisite likewise to place on record. When the torsion

 rod has been in a state of repose, I have frequently shaken the torsion box, by

 rapidly moving the ends backward and forward from side to side 50 or 60 times or
 even more: but I could never discover that this disturbance of the box caused the

 least motion in the torsion rod, which still retained its stationary position. [. . .]

 Yet notwithstanding this torpid state of the torsion rod, if the slightest change of

 temperature be applied near the side of the torsion box, or if either side near the

 balls be sprinkled with a little spirit of wine, the torsion rod is immediately put in

 motion and the resting point undergoes a rapid change. (Baily 1843, pp. 30-31)

 Baily noted that Cavendish' (and Reich's) experimental setup suffered from the
 unprotected state of the torsion box: "[i]n both cases the masses were brought up
 almost close to the outer side of this wooden shaft, but without actually touching
 it: but no mention is made of the application of any intervening substance to guard

 against a change of temperature on the approach of the masses" (Baily 1843, p. 35). In

 order to screen off this source of anomaly, Baily (1843, pp. 38-39) made sure that the

 surfaces of the masses could not approach the torsion box nearer than about an inch,

 "conceiving that this increased distance would be a sufficient protection," and gilded
 the masses "for the purpose of preventing the effect of [heat] radiation, from whatever

 source it might arise" (Baily 1843, p. 41). In a period of 18 months, Baily performed
 nearly 1,300 experiments. Although many of them were made with a view to discover

 the anomalies caused by differences in temperature, some 1,000 experiments were

 50 At this point, Baily inserted the following footnote: "On one or two occasions, when a very fine wire
 and the heaviest balls I have used, I have noticed a slight trembling of the torsion rod, when a loaded
 wagon has been passing the house. But although this motion was closely and designedly watched, I never

 could discover the least angular deviation in the torsion rod. And it may be proper to add that no trembling
 agitation of this kind took place when violent storms and gusts of wind blew against the house: nor have I
 since observed the occurrence here alluded to."

 used to determine the mean density of the earth. Baily (1843, p. 44), nevertheless,
 admitted that discordances occasionally occur, "which cannot wholly be attributed to

 change of temperature, but to some other occult influence with which we are at present
 unacquainted."

 Baily's procedure for determining the times of vibrations was more accurate than

 the one put to use by Cavendish: whereas Cavendish was contented with determining

 the time of a vibration for a whole series of changes in the positions of the masses for

 a single experiment - thereby assuming that the times of vibration are constant, Baily

 (1843, pp. 50, 51-56) determined the time of vibration for every change of position
 of the masses in an improved way.51 He used a similar procedure for determining
 the resting points (Baily 1843, p. 52). Baily also computed the probable error (E) of

 the performed experiments by means of the formula E = ^ x 0.674489 (where S is
 the sum of the squares of all single experiments minus the square of the general mean

 result of the whole multiplied by the number of single experiments (n)) (Baily 1843,
 pp. 84-85).52 Baily's method of determining the earth's mean density was totally
 different from Cavendish'. His computations were derived from a series of analytic
 formulae provided by the Astronomer Royal, George Biddell Airy (1801-1892)53

 (Baily 1843, pp. 99-1 11), which assumed that the weights involved occur in vacuo.54

 Basically, Baily- Airy provided a more complex equation for Cavendish' D :: ^- pro-

 portion,55, H namely: J D = j-Ttx 4

 H namely: J j-Ttx 4 Gx/?x(l+A/-((¿f-£)xCOS2lat.)) 7 jYjr- r TT- h F B

 51 See especially: "Cavendish always took the second mean of the extreme points as the true position
 of the resting point: and always compared his last true resting point in one experiment, with the first true

 resting point of the next succeeding experiment, for the purpose of determining the deviation [. . .]. [. . .] For

 Cavendish always continued the motion of the torsion rod for an indefinite period after the determination

 of the resting point for the deviation, and deduced the mean time of vibration from observations made at
 the beginning and end of that period: not perhaps bearing in mind that, during that period, the time of
 vibration might be (as, indeed, it often is) subject to change. Whereas, on the contrary, the author always

 considered the true time to be that which occurs during the motion of the very vibrations that are employed

 for determining the resting points; having had frequent experience of sudden changes in the time of vibra-

 tion, without any apparent cause: which changes, though perhaps not always very great, might sometimes

 sensibly affect the results, of not carefully attended to" (Baily 1843, pp. 55-56).

 52 The introduction of experimental error was a typical nineteenth-century development (Home 2003,
 p. 373).

 53 On Airy, see DSB, I, pp. 84-87.

 54 Baily computed the weight in vacuo (Wv) on the basis of the weights as measured in air (Wa) with

 the formula Wv = Wa x [l + (s^ga^o^etdy)] ^ 1843' P- ' 13>' In a theoretical Micie
 published in 1840, Luigi Federico Menabrea (1809-1896) provided a series of analytic formula on the
 basis of which the density of the earth could be computed. Cf.: Menabrea (1840, p. 312): "C'est pour
 cela queje me suis proposé, non point de refaire les calculs numériques de l'auteur, ce qui ne présenterait
 pas d'intérêt, d'autant plus qu'il s'agit en Angleterre de procéder à de nouvelles expériences de ce genre,
 mais de reprendre cet intéressant problème de physique sous le point de vue purement analytique, pour

 déduire des équations primitives du mouvement, les formules qui servent à déterminer la densité de la terre."

 Menabrea derived analytic formulae which took the resistance or the air and the spherical shape of the earth
 into account. On Menabrea, see DSB, IX, pp. 267-268.

 55 Gosselin (Gosselin 1859, pp. 482-485) derived a variant formula which expressed the mean density

 of the earth relative to the density of water (D), namely: D = 0000:'5^^xT » where T is the time of
 vibration and n is the motion of the arms. In deriving this formula, Gosselin relied on a value for the earth's

 1/300, and lat. is the latitude of the place at which the experiments are performed,
 depended only on the dimensions of the earth and the second pendulum and it could

 therefore be considered as being constant (Baily 1843, pp. 1 10-1 1 1). The third part,

 ^, where i is the distance of the index from the centre of the small ball, i.e. 1 1 in.,56

 and h is the value for one of the divisions of the index' scale, i.e. ¿, depended on the
 dimensions of the apparatus only and it could likewise be considered as constant. The

 first three parts give rise to a general constant (Baily 1843, pp. 1 17-118). The fourth

 part of the constant, j, where E is the moment of the force of attraction and F is the
 moment of inertia, constituted a special constant which depends on the weight and

 diameter of the small balls and on the weight and length of the torsion rod employed,

 respectively (Baily 1843, pp. 118-120). The final part of the general formula, ^-, is
 to be established by experiment.

 The mean result of this large body of experiments gave a value of 5.6747 for the

 mean density of the earth with a probable error of 0.0038 (Baily 1843, ccxlvii). As
 we have seen, Baily improved upon Cavendish' procedures of eliminating external
 sources of disturbances. More specifically, Baily ensured the stability of the mahog-
 any box and the suspension lines, added an octagonal frame to protect the apparatus

 from variations in temperature, used balls of different materials, and experimented
 with both single and double suspension wires. He also computed the times of vibra-
 tion and the resting points in a more accurate way and based his conclusion on a
 very large body of data. In addition, he introduced a more complex approximation

 for Cavendish' ^- expression and determined the margin of error of the obtained
 experimental result. Despite these improvements, Baily pointed out that occasionally
 unexplained discrepancies occurred which he ascribed to an "occult influence with
 which we are at present unacquainted."

 Accordingly, in a series of articles published in the 1870s, Marie- Alfred Cornu

 (1841-1902), who was Professor of Experimental Physics at the École Polytechnique
 in Paris, and Jean-Baptistin Bailie (1841-1918), who was Professor of Optics and
 Acoustics at the École de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris and a close

 du globe terrestre" of 9.809 m/s2 (Gosselin 1859, pp. 475-476). Gosselin's formula gave slightly higher
 values for D than the one obtained by Cavendish. On the basis of the above formula, he determined that
 the mean density of the earth equals 5.69 (actually: 5.6825) (Gosselin 1859, p. 485).

 56 However, Baily (1843, pp. 1 19-120) notes that when 5, the observed distance, is not exactly equal to

 1 1 in. the distance should be corrected by -p-j .

 friend of Paul Cézanne and Emile Zola, provided a correction to Baily's results.57

 They pointed out that Baily did not sufficiently take into account a systematic error

 caused by the inversion of the attracting weights on their pivot,58 which caused some

 minute trepidations.59 Moreover, Baily himself never succeeded in accounting for the

 decrease of the value for the mean density of the earth whenever heavier balls were

 used. Cornu and Bailie noted that Baily's assumption, that the last elongation for one

 position of the masses may be taken as the first for the succeeding position, was the
 cause of this. As a result of this, the centres of swing are too high in the negative

 position and too low in the positive one (Poynting 1894a, pp. 55-56, 1894b). Once
 the required correction was applied to Baily's result, Cornu and Bailie obtained 5.55
 as the corrected value for the mean density of the earth (Cornu 1878, pp. 701-702).60

 A post-Cavendish pendulum experiment: 1852

 In 1852 Ferdinand Reich (1799-1882), who was Professor of Physics at the Bergak-

 ademie Freiburg, published the results of a series of experiments he had performed to

 determine the mean density of the earth. The method of processing the observations
 was similar to that of Baily (Reich 1852, p. 390). However, the apparatus Reich used
 was entirely different (see Fig. 5) (Reich 1852, pp. 392-394). Reich used a single tin
 mass b suspended along a silvered copper wire of 2.270 m. In order to prevent any
 air circulation, the space between the moveable axis of suspension, which pivots on
 an endless screw, and the upper part of the surrounding case CD was filled with a

 pouch with cotton lining. The lower part of the case was cylindrical and surrounded
 by a horizontal turntable, which could be turned 180° and on which the mass A is
 placed. Reich established a value of 5.5832 ± 0.0149 for the mean density of the earth

 (Reich 1852, p. 418). In order to determine the degree of influence of (dia)magnetism,

 he experimented with a diamagnetic attracted mass of bismuth and an attracted iron

 mass, which gave the following values for the mean density of the earth, respectively:
 5.5333 ± 0.0403 and 5.6887 ± 0.0312 (Reich 1852, p. 422, 425). Rather than making

 any rash conclusions on the basis of this, Reich insisted on future research on the

 57 The opening sentence of their article goes as follows: "Depuis la découverte de la loi de l'attraction
 universelle par Newton, un problème expérimental d'une grand importance s'est naturellement posé aux
 astronomes et aux physiciens, à savoir: la détermination de la valeur numérique de la constante qui exprime
 l'attraction réciproque de deux unités de masses placées a unité de distance" (Cornu and Baille 1873, p.
 954). Although they clarify the relation between G and the density of the earth (A) - by supposing a spher-
 ical approximation of the earth - and provide a corrected value for A, no exact determination of G was
 provided. On Cornu, see DSB, III, pp. 419-420.

 58 See: "Ces études nous ont conduits à reconnaître dans les expériences de nos devanciers des causes d'err-

 eurs systématiques, qui, dans les observations de Baily en particulier, ont eu une influence très-marquée."
 (Cornu and Baille 1873, p. 700).

 il se produit inévitablement des trépidations et des chocs qui se transmettent partiellement au levier par

 setup, see Cornu (1891).

 Post-Cavendish pendulum experiments near and below the surface of the earth:
 1856-1885

 204 S. Ducheyne

 The aim of performing pendulum experiments above and below the earth's surface is

 to infer the earth's mean density on the basis of the observed difference in the rates of

 two invariable pendulums, one at the top and the other at the bottom of a deep shaft,
 which were set to swing simultaneously. In order to do so, G.B. Airy62 established

 the following formula for determining the mean density of the earth: ^ = -, - ^ v ,

 where D is the mean density of the earth's sphere,63 R is the radius of the earth's
 sphere, d is the mean density of the outer spherical shell with a thickness c (equal
 to the depth of the mine) which surrounds the earth's sphere, G is the pendulum's
 gravity at the bottom of the mine, and g is the pendulum's gravity above the mine

 (Airy 1856, p. 297).04 As c, R and d - Airy took to latter to be 2 - are known, we only

 have to establish |, which Airy computed to be 1.00005185 ± 0.00000019, in order
 to determine D (Airy 1856, p. 330). By filling in the parts of the equation, it follows
 that D = 6.566 ± 0.0182 (Airy 1856, p. 342). The Achilles' heel of Airy 's result lied

 in the uncertain value for the mean density of the outer spherical shell, d - moreover,

 his result was dependent on both the accuracy of the pendulums involved and the
 ability of the observers involved to make observations with considerable precision.
 In the same article, to which we have already referred previously, Jacob pointed out

 that "Mr. Airy has indeed shown that, in the case of his experiment, it is sufficient

 if we know, as regards the upper shell, the form and density of that portion which
 is in the immediate neighbourhood of the place of observation, without attending to

 irregularities of distant parts; but he has not shown that variations of density below and

 near to his lowest station would not sensibly vitiate his results" (Jacob 1857, p. 296
 [underscore added]).65

 The aim of the experiment performed by Robert (Daublebsky) von Sterneck (1839-
 1910),66 at the Adelbert shaft in Příbram (Böhmen) in 1883 was identical to Airy's

 experiments, namely "aus den Unterschieden der Schwingungszeiten eines Pendels
 auf der Erdoberfläche und in verschiedenen Tiefen unter derselben die Äderungen der
 Schwere im Innern der Erde mit zunehmender Tiefe zu bestimmen" (Sterneck 1883,

 p. 59).67 The motion of the two pendulums was simultaneously observed in compar-
 ison to the same clock which was installed at the surface of the shaft and which was

 connected by means of an electrical circuit to the two clocks accompanying each of

 62 On Airy, see DSBy I, pp. 84-87 and NDSB, I, pp. 24-26.

 63 Airy's approximation supposed that the earth's figure was that of sphere and that it consisted of homo-
 geneously concentric spherical shells.

 64 Furthermore, the error (a) in D caused by an error in G is given as^ = ^£x^x^.

 65 Compare with Poynting (1894a, p. 621, 1894b): "All to the methods which I have so far described
 use, as you will have noticed, natural masses to compare the earth with, and herein lies a fatal defect as

 regards exactness. We do not know accurately the density of these masses and what is the condition of the
 surrounding and underlying strata. We can really only from at best rough guesses."

 66 Sterneck was Major-General at the Militär-geographische Institut in Vienna.

 the pendulums (Stemeck 1883, pp. 68-69). The accuracy implied thereby was a major
 advance in comparison to Airy's method. In order to compute the mean density of

 the earth, Sterneck used the same formula Airy had previously relied on - Sterneck

 (1883, p. 90) estimated the value of d to be 2.75. When filling in the formula Sterneck

 arrived at the following determinations of D, i.e. the mean density of the earth: 5.71

 at 516m, 5.81 at 747.9m, and 5.80 at 972.5 m below the surface, which gives a mean

 of ca. 5.77 (Sterneck 1883, p. 89, p. 91).68 Two year later, Sterneck performed similar

 experiments at the Abraham shaft in Freiberg. On the basis of the experiments col-

 lected there, he computed the following values of D: 5.66 at 97.42 m, 6.66 at 257.04 m,
 7.15 at 414.20m, and 7.60 at 534.08m below the surface (Sterneck 1883, pp. 113-
 1 14).69 Despite the improvements Sterneck made in comparison to Airy, his result

 was equally liable to error caused by the uncertain value for the mean density of the

 outer spherical shell. In this context, Poynting adequately pointed out that "[t]he true

 value of experiments on gravity below the earth's surface would appear to lie not in

 their use to determine the mean density of the earth, but rather in their indication, by

 anomalies, of irregularities in density in the region round the place of the experiment"
 (Poynting 1894a, p. 38, 1894b; cf. Radau 1887, p. 237). In other words, the method

 followed by Airy and von Sterneck introduced a considerable uncertainty with respect

 to the computation of the attractive forces. Cavendish' method did not suffer from this

 problem - however, due to the sensitivity of the apparatus successful ways to eliminate

 disturbing forces had to be sought for.70

 Post-Cavendish experiments with the common balance: 1881

 The first detailed common balance experiment seems to have been performed by
 Philipp J. G. von Jolly. In 1881 Jolly (1809-1884)71 had devised an experiment using

 a common balance by which he sought to measure the increase in weight with decrease

 68 At the end of his article, Sterneck (Stemeck 1883, pp. 91-92) hypothesized that the mean density of
 the outer shell varies as the distance only.

 69 Based on the computed values for D and the temperature measurements he had simultaneously per-
 formed, Stemeck (Stemeck 1883, pp. 1 17-1 19) suggested that the increase of gravity with increasing depth
 is nearly proportional to the increase of temperature. Poynting, however, correctly noted that we should
 ascribe the increase of gravity with depth to underground variations in density. "In our ignorance of the

 conditions below the lowest level yet reached in mining, there is no difficulty in accepting the explanation,"
 he commented (Poynting 1894a, p. 36, 1894b).

 70 Wilsing wrote: "Darum bezeichnet die Coulomb'sche Erfinding der Torsionswage und ihre Anwendung
 auf das vorliegende Problem durch Cavendish einen erheblichen Fortschritt zur exacten Lösung des Prob-
 lems. Bei der grossen Empfindlichkeit dieses instruments konnte nämlich die Anziehung wenige Centner
 schwerer Kugeln, derer Masse sich ohne Schwierigkeit durch directe Wägung bestimmen Hess, messbar
 nachgewezen werden, und damit trat die Dichtigkeitbestimmung der Erde in den Kreis der Laboratoriums-
 versuche ein. Allein die grosse Empfindlichkeit der Torsionswage, durch welche die Unsicherheit in der

 Berechnung der anziehenden Kräfte beseitigt wird, hat Uebelstände anderer Art zur Folge, deren zuerst
 Francis Bailey Erwägnung thut, welcher sich mit Rücksicht auf die vorliegende Aufgabe eingehend mit
 dem Studium der Torsionswage beschäftigt hat" (Wilsing 1887, p. 35).

 of Physics at the University of Heidelberg. Later in life he moved to the University of Munich, where one

 of the distance from the earth's surface. He used a balance in which in each of the

 two pans two identical 5 kg spheres, which were filled with mercury, were placed.
 Two additional scale pans, in each of which an air-filled sphere of equal volume to

 that of the mercury-filled spheres was put, were suspended to each of the pans above
 (for the details see Jolly 1881, pp. 332-333). Next, on one side of the balance, the

 mercury-filled sphere and the air-filled sphere were interchanged (Jolly 1881, p. 334).
 Due to the increase of the weight caused by the decrease of the distance from the
 earth's surface, the balance was no longer in equilibrium and small weights had to be
 added on the other side of the balance to restore the equilibrium. In addition, a large

 lead sphere with a radius of 0.4975 m and a weight of 5,775.5 kg was placed below the

 interchanged spheres and the procedure was repeated. Jolly calculated that increase of
 weight caused by the massive lead sphere was 0.589 mg (Jolly 1881, p. 350). On the

 basis of the formula p = JÁ x ^, Jolly established that the mean density of the earth,
 p, is equal to 5.692 ± 0.068, where r is the radius of the lead sphere, i.e. 0.4975 m,
 8 is the mean specific weight of the lead sphere, i.e. 11.186, R is the distance from

 the centre of the mercury-filled sphere and the centre of the earth, i.e. 6,365,722 m, a

 is the distance from the centre of the mercury-filled sphere to the centre of the lead

 sphere, i.e. 0.5686 m, q is the observed increase of weight, i.e. 0.589 mg, and Q is the
 weight of the mercury-filled sphere, i.e. 5,009,450 mg (Jolly 1881, pp. 350-351).

 Coda

 The up-shut of the nineteenth-century research on the mean density of the earth,
 which we have surveyed so far, was that several independent and relatively reliable
 determinations of the mean density of the earth - of varying degrees of accuracy
 and precision72 - provided measurements which were quite close to one other (see
 Table 1, for a summary of the results which the author has discussed in this section).

 The implication of the Cavendish experiment, i.e. that robust gravitational interactions
 occur between terrestrial bodies, was confirmed independently of Cavendish' original

 experiment. Moreover, as experimenters had become increasingly skilled in eliminat-

 ing external disturbances, the evidential support for the claim that the law of universal
 gravitation holds at smaller distances than celestial ones had become increasingly

 stronger.73

 72 Terminological clarification: "accuracy" refers to the closeness of an experimental result to the true
 value; "precision" to the fineness of the scale involved. The percentage by which these experimental results
 differ from the present-day value are: ca. 1.21% (Cavendish), ca. 2.90% (Baily), ca. 1.24% (Reich), ca.
 19.06% (Airy), ca. 0.63% (Cornu and Bailie), ca. 3.21% (Jolly), and ca. 1.16% (Wilsing) (see Table 1).
 Baily's and Reich's results are the most precise, whilst Cornu's and Bailie's are the least precise.

 73 Near the end of the nineteenth century, a new method to determine the mean density of the earth was
 devised. In 1887 and 1889 Johannes Wilsing published two accompanying studies on the determination of

 the density of the earth by means of a vertical pendulum balance, which were both appeared in Publicationen
 des Astro-Physikalischen Observatoriums zu Potsdam (on Wilsing, see DSB, IV, p. 414). The use of a brass

 vertical pendulum with a length of 1 m was a notable feature of the apparatus involved. The idea was that a
 vertical pendulum balance would provide more reliable results than a horizontal pendulum balance, insofar
 as it could be considered as a rigid system and insofar as it is protected from bending by its (vertical) position

 (Wilsing 1887, p. 36). By the choice of materials magnetic effects were guarded against. Precautions were

 Near the end of the nineteenth century, scientists continued to work on the mean
 density of the earth. However, by then the research focus had shifted: determining
 G had became the centre of scientific attention - an interest which continues to this

 very day.74 The determination of the mean density of the earth was from then on

 seen as a corollary to the determination of big G. On this matter, Poynting recorded

 that although the scientific articles, which will be discussed in the section at hand,

 provided a determination of the mean density of the earth, "they have a more general

 aspect and may be regarded as determining the exact expression of Newton's Law of

 Gravitation" (Poynting 1913, p. 84 [italics added]). In the same context, he remarked,
 in an address to The Royal Institution of Great Britain, entitled 'Recent Studies in
 Gravitation' (1900), that "Professor Boys has almost indignantly disclaimed that he
 was engaged on any such purely local experiment as the determination of the mean

 density of the earth. He was working for the Universe, seeking the value ofG, infor-

 mation which would be as useful on Mars or Jupiter or out in the stellar system as
 here on the earth" (Poynting 1920, p. 633 [italics added]).

 By adding G, which indicates the strength of gravitation, to Newton's original
 (proportional) formulation of the law of universal gravitation a major advantage was
 created: gravitational forces could be determined and formulated in absolute terms,

 i.e. in terms of standard units. As a consequence, masses and densities could from

 also made to minimize changes in temperature and air flow. The pendulum, to which at each end two
 brass balls - weighing 533.93 and 545. 10g (Wilsing 1887, p. 59) - were attached, was strengthened near
 its middle by means of a frame, inside of which a non-sharp agate knife-edge - which is above and very
 near to the centre of gravity of the pendulum - rests on a concave agate bearing (Wilsing 1 887, p. 37). Two
 iron cylinders, weighing 325 kg each, served as the attracting masses (Wilsing 1887, p. 39). The masses
 were installed at opposite sides of the pendulum balance in such a way so that the centres of each cylinder

 were on the same horizontal plane as the centres of their corresponding balls. In order to compute the mean

 density of the earth, the double deflections, caused by lowering the upper mass and simultaneously raising
 the lower mass, and the times of vibration were required. Wilsing obtained a value for the mean density of
 the earth of 5.594 ± 0.032 (Wilsing 1887, p. 85). In his second study, in which he had paid extra attention
 to possible changes in temperature, Wilsing corrected the value for the density of the earth to 5.579 ±0.012
 (Wilsing 1889, p. 141).

 74 On the role of G in contemporary theoretical physics, see Damour (1999).

 then on be calculated in absolute terms. These advantages were, however, a by-prod-

 uct of the fact that G was empirically shown to be relatively stable. Late nineteenth

 century experimental physics had succeeded in empirically establishing the value of

 the strength of gravitational interaction, which was inferred from experimental setups
 which involved terrestrial bodies.

 208 S. Ducheyne

 Poynting

 In 1892 John Henry Poynting's (1852-1914)75 article on the determination of the

 mean density of the earth and the gravitational constant appeared in the Philosophical

 Transactions of the Royal Society of London A.76 In its introduction, Poynting wrote:

 It might appear useless to add another to the list of determinations, especially

 when, as Mr. Boys has recently shown, the torsion balance may be used for the

 experiment with an accuracy quite unattainable by the common balance. But I

 think that in the case of such a constant as that of gravitation, where the results

 have hardly as yet begun to close in on any definite value, and where, indeed,

 we are hardly assured of the constancy itself, it is important to have as many

 determinations as possible made by different methods and different instruments,

 until all the sources of discrepancy are traced and the results agree. (Poynting
 1892, p. 565 [italics added]).

 In his article, Poynting set out to experimentally determine "the attraction of one
 known mass M on another known mass Mf a known distance d away from it,"77 i.e.

 to determine G (Poynting 1892, p. 566).78 He added that "[t]he law of universal grav-

 itation states that when the masses are spheres with centres d apart this attraction is

 GMM! ¡d1, G being a constant - the gravitation constant - the same for all masses."

 "Astronomical observation fully justify the law as far as M'/d2 is concerned," these

 "do not, however, give the value of G, but only that of the product GM for various mem-

 bers of the solar system" (Poynting 1892, p. 566).79 Once G is known, the earth's mean

 density is easily derivable: the attraction of the earth - approximated as a sphere - on

 75 For an account of Poynting's person and work, see: Poynting (1920, vii-xxvi). See, furthermore, DSB,
 XI, pp. 122-123.

 76 Poynting's endeavour to use the common balance to measure the density of the earth dates back to more
 than a decade before the publication of his 1892 article (see Poynting 1920, pp. 7^2 and Falconer 1999b).

 77 Poynting (Poynting 1892, p. 566) referred to this method as the "Trepared Mass' method."

 78 Poynting used the following metaphor to describe the aim of the experiment: "Imagine a balance large
 enough to contain on one pan the whole population of the British Islands, and that all the population were
 placed there but one medium-sized boy. Then the increase in weight which had to be measured was equiv-
 alent to measuring the increase due to putting that boy on with the rest. The accuracy of measurement was

 equivalent to observing from the increase in weight, whether or no he had taken off one of his boots before
 stepping on the pan" (Poynting 1894a, p. 626, 1894b).

 79 In 1900 Poynting (1920, p. 630) wrote: "If [. . .] we compare the accelerations due to different pulling
 bodies, as for instance that of the sun pulling the earth, with that of the earth pulling the moon, or if we

 compare changes in motion due to the different planets pulling each other, we can compare their masses
 and weigh them, one against the other and each against the sun. But in this weighing our standard is not the

 pound of kilogramme of terrestrial weighings, but the mass of the sun."

 any mass M1 is given as GVAM - where V is the volume of the earth, A is the mean

 density of the earth, and R is the radius of the sphere of the earth - which equals M'g,

 where g is the accelerative force of the earth. Therefore, A = &Sy. The apparatus
 used in Poynting's experiment, which was installed in a basement room at Mason

 College in Birmingham,80 is depicted on Fig. 6. During the experiment, air currents
 and variations in temperature and air pressure were avoided as far as possible.81 All
 weights were made of an alloy of lead and antimony (Poynting 1892, p. 578). Two
 nearly equal masses A and B were suspended from a balance. The weight of A equals
 21,582.33 g and that of B equals 21,566.21 g (Poynting 1892, p. 579). A and B are
 furthermore placed within a wooden case. Mass M , weighing 153,407.26g, is placed
 underneath A. Once we have observed the change in position of the beam, which has a

 length of 1 .23329 m (Poynting 1 892, p. 57 1 ) we turn M 1 80° degrees so that M is now

 underneath B. Once M has switched sides, we observe the position of the beam once
 again. In this configuration, the attraction is taken away from A and added to B. In

 order to eliminate the attraction of M on the beam and the suspending wires, we raise

 A and B to the equally higher positions Af and B' "[f]or the difference between the

 two increments of weight on the right, is due solely to the alteration of the positions
 of A and B relative to M , the attraction on the beam remaining the same in each"
 (Poynting 1892, p. 567).82 In order to compensate for the tilting of the floor which
 arose when M was moved, an additional mass m, which is nearly half as big as M ,
 i.e. 76,497.4 g, was installed twice as far from the axis and on the opposite side of M

 (Poynting 1892, pp. 567-568, 579). Due to the addition of m, the "resultant pressure
 was now always through the axis" and no "tilting of the floor when the turntable was

 moved" could be detected (Poynting 1892, p. 569). Both M and m were steadily placed
 on a turntable, which could be manipulated in the room above the basement. A scale

 was fixed horizontally to the end of the telescope by means of which the subsidiary
 riders attached to the centre of the balance beam could be monitored, and hence the
 tilt of the beam.

 "Assuming that a spherical mass M attracts another spherical mass M ' when their

 centres are D centimeters apart with a force of GMM '/D2 dynes," Poynting (Poynting

 1892, p. 603) stated, "we can express the change of vertical pull due to the change of
 position of the masses as G x a function F of the masses and distances." In addition

 of Af s pull on the weights A and B, there is a (vertical) pull, E9 exerted on the beam

 and the suspending rods. Assume that M produces a vertical pull of n dynes.83 In this

 case, n = G F + E. When the weights A and B are raised to positions A1 and Bf, they
 will be undergo a vertical pull of nf dynes. Let / be the function of the masses and
 the new distances corresponding to F, so that nf = Gf + E. As noted above, what

 we are interested in is the difference between the forces n and nr . From what is given,

 80 It was first set up at the Cavendish Laboratory "through the kindness of Professor Clerk Maxwell"
 (Poynting 1892, p. 566, cf. p. 569).

 For the detailed discussion of Poynting's (Poynting 1892, pp. 565-602) experimental setup, see Part I

 of his article.

 82 These vertical displacements were measured by means of a standard cathetometer (Poynting 1892,
 pp. 588-591).

 83 The "dyne" is an old unit of force; 1 dyne equals 10~5 N.

 of the nature of physical laws, they have, we must confess, greatly fallen off in dignity. No long time ago
 they were quite commonly described as the Fixed Laws of Nature, and were supposed sufficient in them-
 selves to govern the universe. Now we can only assign to them the humble rank of mere descriptions, often
 tentative, often erroneous, of similarities which we believe we have observed" (Poynting 1920, p. 600, cf.
 pp. 686-698).

 plete the equation G = ^7, which was equal to 6.6984 x 10"8 (Poynting 1892,
 p. 612). Once G was established, the mean density, A, could be determined by the for-

 mula

 to 5.4934 (Poynting 1892, p. 607). When looking back on the experiment a couple of

 years later, Poynting remarked:

 At last my long catalogue of experiments is brought to an end, or rather it is

 brought up to the present time, for such researches have no end. Each generation

 will try to add another decimal place to the result or find out the errors of its

 predecessors. And even now there are many workers in the field, indeed, there

 is almost an epidemic of earth- weighing (Poynting 1894a, p. 627)85

 In his 1900 address to the Royal Institution of Great Britain, already referred to in

 a footnote, he concluded:

 So while the experiments to determine G are converging on the same value,

 the attempts to show that, under certain conditions, it may not be constant, have

 resulted so far in failure all along the line. No attack on gravitation has succeeded

 in showing that it is related to anything but the masses of the attracting bodies

 85 In 1900 Poynting would remark the following: "But gravitation still stands alone. The isolation which

 Faraday sought to break down is still complete. Yet the work I have been describing is not all failure. We
 at least know something in knowing what qualities gravitation does not possess, and when the time shall
 come for explanation all these laborious and, at first sight, useless experiments will take their place in the
 foundation on which that explanation will be built (Poynting 1920, p. 644).

 condition of the acting masses or to the intervening medium. (Poynting 1920, p.
 643)

 212 S. Ducheyne

 Boys

 In 1895 Charles Vernon Boys' (1855-1944)86 article "On the Newtonian constant of
 Gravitation" appeared in print.87 Boys' experiment involved a 0.9 in. mirror torsion
 rod, which was placed inside the central tube T (see Fig. 8). The experiment was

 performed in the vaults under the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University during

 favourable conditions.88 Two attracted golden masses m and m were suspended - one

 6 in. above the other - by fine quartz fibres on each of the sides of the torsion rod.
 The diameters of the golden balls were 0.2 (occasionally, 0.25) inch and the distance

 between their centres was 1 in. By the incorporation of quartz fibres, which have the

 property to produce a small and constant torsion, "Boys put into the hands of phys-
 icists a means of making torsion balances for the measurement of small forces far
 exceeding in delicacy and accuracy anything hitherto used" (Poynting 1913, p. 68).
 The torsion rod and the small masses attached to it had to be reduced in size so that the

 fine quartz fibres could carry their weights. This entailed that the apparatus suffered

 less from variations in temperature and air currents; on the other hand, the variables

 to be measured were rendered considerably minute. Boys argued that by reducing the

 size of the apparatus its sensibility could be increased. The two attracting lead masses

 M and M were hung from the two diametrically opposed tubular pillars P and P. The-

 ses masses could be smoothly moved around T by turning the little wheel D, which

 by means of the action of the train of wheels WWW turned the lid L. The attracting
 masses were hung at the same level as their closest attracted mass. The edge of the

 flange was divided in degrees and could be read on the vernier V to 0. Io. The readings
 of the vernier were observed by the aid of a small telescope, which was installed at
 a distance. The diameters of the lead balls were 4.25 (occasionally, 2.25) inches and

 the distance between their centres was 4 or 6 in., depending the size of the balls being

 used. Boys computed that the maximum deflection of the attracted balls is produced
 when the lead balls are moved from their + to - position through an angle of 65°
 (Boys 1895, p. 46).

 By filling in the formula G = 4^, where G is the gravitational constant, P is
 the mean value of the observed deflections in scale divisions, S is the actual couple

 87 The author shall not go into the minute details of Boys' sophisticated apparatus, see Boys ( 1 895, pp. 1-
 37) for the details or Boys (1889) for an early description oí the apparatus. In its introductory words, Boys

 wrote: "The Cavendish experiment for determining the constant of universal, from which the density of the

 earth may be calculated, is so well known that there is no occasion to describe it" (Boys 1889, p. 253 [italics
 added]).

 88 Boys recorded: "The daytime, of course, is out of the question, owing to the rattling traffic in St. Giles',
 about a quarter of a mile away; and all nights except Sunday night the railway people are engaged making
 up trains and shunting, which is more continuous and disturbing to the steadiness of the ground than a
 passing train" (Boys 1895, p. 47).

 the value for G becomes 6.6579 x 10~8 and, correspondingly, we obtain a value of
 5.5268 for the mean density of the earth (Boys 1895, p. 62).

 89 When Q is multiplied by G, we obtain "the actual moment produced upon the torsion fibre by the action
 of the balls upon one another upon the supposition that the balls are all spheres, and act as if they were
 concentrated in their centres" (Boys 1895, pp. 58-59).

 Braun

 Just as in the articles of Boys and Poynting, the primary focus of Carl Braun's (S.J.,

 1837-1907) 1896 article, in which he presented the results of the experiments he had

 begun in 1892, was on the determination of G.91 A reviewer, Wads worth, commented

 as follows on Braun's experiment:

 The work of Dr. Braun in this same field, which is fully described in the above
 memoir, is perhaps less elegant and finished than that of Professor Boys as

 regards some of the details of the design, construction, and manipulation of the

 apparatus, but, in view of the great length of time devoted to it, the variety of
 methods of observation employed, the careful consideration of all sources of
 error, and the painstaking means adopted to eliminate them as far as possible
 from the measurements; it must, I think, be admitted as worthy of ranking the

 work of the latter in point of accuracy, which is perhaps the highest praise that
 can be bestowed upon it. (Wadsworth 1897, p. 159)

 In the corner of his room, Braun had attached a square tile to a wall. A ring was

 attached to the surface of the tile and a plate of glass, adequately cut, was placed inside

 the ring (see Fig. 9a, b). The brass torsion rod was hung from the top of a system of
 axial tubes by means of a brass suspension wire (see Braun 1896, pp. 189-192, for
 the details of the experimental setup). In the central tube, which is supported by a

 tripod, another tube was inserted, and in this tube a third tube was placed. The torsion
 arm, from which two gilded brass balls of an average weight of 54.2657 were sus-
 pended on equal heights at a distance of ca. 24.6 cm from each other, was triangular

 and consisted of copper wires of 1 and 2 mm. The whole apparatus was covered by a

 bell-jar within which a vacuum could be created. Around the bell-jar, two masses were

 suspended from another ring installed above. Two sets of balls were used: one set of
 brass masses - the first mass weighing 5.1590kg, the second weighing 5.0905 kg; the

 other set of hollow globes filled with mercury - the first mass weighing 9.18475 kg,

 the second weighing 9.10757 kg. By the choice of materials, influences of the earth's

 magnetic field were negligible. In addition, the temperature was kept as constant as
 possible and because the created vacuum was so tight the pressure inside the glass
 cover remained constant. Braun studied two different types of effects: the motion
 of the torsion rod when the masses were at an equal height (horizontal or deflected
 movement of the rod) and the downward and upward motion of the torsion rod when

 91 See: "Von den drei Grossen Io Gravitations-Constante (C), 2° Masse der Erde (M), 3° mittlere Dichte

 der Erde (D) ist die erstere in wissenschaftlicher Hinsicht die wichtigste, sofern sie die Constante für ein

 allgemeines Naturgesetz ist und wahrscheinlich im ganzen Universum Geltung hat. [. . .] Die dritte Grosse
 (D) ist noch mehr von diesen Quantitäten abhängig und ist eigentlich von geringere Wichtigkeit" (Braun
 1896, p. 188 [italics added]). Braun explicated the relation between C, M and D, as follows. The earth's
 mass equals the product of its volume and density (Me = VeDe). Furthermore, the volume of an oblate

 spheroid is given by 4lI% b , where a is the equatorial radius and b is the polar radius. The accelerative force

 at the surface of the earth - approximated by an oblong spheroid - at latitude <p, g^), equals -r¡~7> where

 P(^,) is the radius at latitude <p, and C is the gravitational constant. Therefore: CDe = 8W)P vP) (hence: C

 is given by S(fy£W and De is given by *#$&>) (Braun 1896, pp. 188-189).

 the ring, from which the masses were hung, was turned sideways in an oblique angle

 (vertical or oscillatory movement of the rod). Both effects were observed in a separate

 series of experiments and both were treated by two different methods: a deflection
 method ("Deflexionsmethode"), which was inspired by Cavendish, and an oscillation
 method ("Oscillationsmethode"), which was inspired by Reich (Braun 1896, pp. 201-
 205, 205-21 1).92 By determining the actual torque produced by the masses, which
 could be computed from the moment of inertia and the times of swing of the balls,
 Braun had two independent routes to calculate the gravitational constant, C (and,
 consequently, the mean density of the earth, D), at his disposal (Braun 1896, p. 201,
 241, 253, respectively).93 By combining the results established by both methods,
 Braun (Braun 1896, p. 258c) concluded that De = 5.52700 ± ca. 0.0014 and that
 C = 6.65816 ± 0.00168 x 10"8.94 This result matched quite well with the value for
 C which Boys' had established: 6.6579 x 10~8.95 To give an idea of the smallness of
 the forces involved: the mean deflective attraction on each of the balls was 0.00031

 dynes (or 0.00031 x 10~5 N) and the mean oscillatory attraction on each of the balls

 92 See, furthermore, Braun ( 1 896, pp. 2 1 1 -22 1 , 22 1 -226) for the correction factors which Braun introduced
 for both methods.

 93 Braun ( 1 896, p. 1 89) compared the actual deflection produced with a theoretically derived value for the
 deflection, which assumed an initial value for C The aim of the article was to determine experimentally
 how much the actual deflection is and, on the basis of this, Braun sought to establish by how much the
 initial value for C needed to be corrected. Cf.: "Das Princip dieser Methode is nun sehr einfach. Ist die
 Zinkscheibe mit den daran hangenden Massen M um einen Winkel c gedreht, so kann die Torsionskraft
 berechnet werden, welche durch die Anziehung der massen M gegen die Kugeln m hervorgebracht wird.

 Und da die Torsivkraft des Drahtes aus dem Trägheitsmoment unde der Schwingungszeit berechnet ist [. . .],

 so kann auch die Ablenkung berechnet werden, welche durch jene [. . .] Stellung der Massen bewirkt werden
 muss, sofern die vorausgesetzte Gravitations-Constante C richtig ist. Aus den Beobachtungen anderseits
 ergibt sich in der oben [. . .] beschriebenden Weise, wie gross die wirklich bewirkte Ablenkung ist. Aus
 dem kleinen Unterschied swischen diesen beiden Wirkungen ergibt sich dann leicht, um wie viel jenes C
 corrigirt werden muss, um das wahre C zu erlangen, und damit auch £>" (Braun 1896, p. 201).

 94 In the same year Ronald (Loránd) von Eötvös' article 'Untersuchungen über Gravitation und Erdmagne-

 tismus' appeared in print, which contained a section on the gravitational constant and the density of the earth

 (Eötvös 1896, pp. 385-392). Eötvös placed a torsion balance similar to that used in Baily's experiment, i.e.
 a "reverse Cavendish torsion rod," which was surrounded by a case and which he installed between two
 equal pillars of lead (for the figure, see Eötvös (1896, p. 387). He then compared the time of vibration of the

 rod in the longitudinal direction, i.e. parallel to the line connecting the two pillars, to that in the transversal
 direction, i.e. perpendicular to the line connecting the pillars (Eötvös 1896, p. 388). Given these data he

 was able to complete the following equation: -X - -X = 8/°r0~g)> where T' is the time of vibration in

 7, rt

 the longitudinal direction, 7t is is the time of vibration in the transversal direction, / is the gravitational
 constant, a is the density of the pillars, and 1- e is a correction factor (Eötvös 1896, pp. 389-391). Given
 this formula, Eötvös could now determine /, for which he found a result of 6.65 x 10~8 (Eötvös 1896, p.
 392). In his article Eötvös' did not bother to mention the value for the mean density of the earth. On Eötvös'
 contribution to the study of the earth's surface gravity, see Howarth (2007b, pp. 245-249). On Eötvös, see
 DSB, IV, pp. 377-381.

 95 On which Wadsworth remarked: "Each is admitted to be uncertain by at least one and perhaps two units

 in the fourth place, so that the agreement to even the fifth figure is more likely to be a striking coincidence
 than an indication of real accuracy obtained" (Wadsworth 1897, p. 163). On the same page, he remarked,
 furthermore, that: "Results obtained by other methods, notably the one obtained by Poynting, (1880-1891)
 by the balance method, have differed quite widely from the above, and whilst they are undoubtedly less
 accurate than the latter, so far as accidental errors of observation are concerned, it may be that the Cavendish
 method is subject to some constant source of error yet unsuspected and undiscovered."

 was 0.00045 dynes (or 0.00045 x 10~5 N) (Braun 1896, p. 256). Braun concluded
 his article by remarking that the obtained results are provisional and by adding that:

 From a purely scientific point of view, the issue, as to whether Newton's law
 of universal gravitation q = MmC : r2 holds absolutely exactly, could indeed
 consider as quite settled. Only from a natural-philosophical point of view, there

 remains an important question. Since, first and foremost, the reasons which speak

 for the correctness of the law of gravitation are quite removed to prove the abso-

 lute exactness of the same [law]; additionally, there are also good reasons which

 justify doubt, namely concerning the factors M and m and the factor 1/r2. First

 of all, it is namely not unlikely that the attraction is stronger at infra-microscopic

 distances than that which follows by the formula [of universal gravitation]. Since

 by accepting this assumption, the possibility would be allowed that molecular
 forces could also be attributed to gravitation - so that the somewhat unnatu-
 rally seeming necessity that several heterogeneous attraction forces need to be
 accepted, would be cancelled out; and, secondly, [since] according to the only
 fairly supportable mechanical explanation of the gravity, this must go back to

 pushes of the ether atoms, it seems quite unavoidable that the attraction of a enor-

 mous body must be smaller than stated by the formula [of universal gravitation].

 (Braun 1896, p. 257 [italics added])96

 Richarz and Krigar-Menzel

 By their choice of apparatus, Franz Richarz (1860-1920) and Otto Krigar-Menzel
 (1861-1930) sought to accommodate some inaccuracies in the method of Jolly,97

 96 Author's translation of: "Allerdings könnte man vom rein wissenschaftlichen Standpunkt aus, für wel-
 chen das Newton'sche Gravitationsgesetz q = MmC : r2 als absolut genau gilt, die Frage als einigermassen

 abgethan ansehen. Allein vom naturphilosophischen Standpunkt aus gibt es doch noch ein gewichtiges Frag-
 ezeichen. Denn zunächts sind die Gründe, welche ßr die Richtigkeit des Gravitationsgesetzes sprechen, weit

 entfernt, eine absolute Genauigkeit desselben zu beweisen, und anderseits gibt es auch gute Gründe, welche
 einen Zweifel rechtfertigen, und zwar sowohl hinsichtlich der Factoren M und m , als des Factors l/r2. Es
 ist nämlich erstens nicht unwahrscheinlich, dass für infra-mikroskopische Distanzen die Anziehungskraft

 stärker sei, als der Formel entspricht. Denn mit dieser Annahme würde eine Aussicht eröffnet, dass auch die
 Molecularkräfte auf die Gravitation zurückgeführt werden könnten, so dass die etwas unnatürlich schein-
 ende Notwendigkeit, mehrere heterogene Anziehungskräfte annehmen zu müssen, entfiele; - und
 zweitens nachdem die einzige einigermassen haltbare mechanische Erklärung der Gravitation diese auf
 Stösse der Ätheratome zurückführen muss, scheint es ganz unausweichlich, das für enorm grosse Massen
 die Attraction kleiner sein müsse, als die Formel angibt." I am indebted to Christian Straßer for checking

 and improving the above translation.

 97 See: "Während bei Jolly sich besonders an den 21m Drähten der Einfluss auch geringer Luftströmingen

 sehr stark geltend machte und stets eine erhebliche Temperaturdifferenz zwischen dem Orte der oberen und
 der unteren Wageschalen herrschte, war Poynting von solchen störenden Einflüssen bei den weit kleineren
 Dimensionen seines Apparates fast ganz frei" (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, p. 4).

 sion of Jolly's balance: two scales were connected by a bar of 2.25 m and under-
 neath them two additional scales were placed (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, p. 4).
 Experiments were performed in a room inside the Citadel of Spandau in Haselhorst
 (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, pp. 6-12). Air pressure, temperature, and atmo-
 spheric humidity was carefully monitored and air currents were minimized (Richarz

 1 kg spherical brass masses100 was placed in the left scale above, whilst the second
 was placed in the right scale below. Next, the mass on the upper left scale was put
 on the lower left scale and the lower right mass on the upper right scale. The dif-

 ferences between the two equilibriums gives the double decrease of weight as height
 increases (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, p. 4). Finally, this procedure was repeated

 in the presence of an enormous parallelepiped block of lead (its weight was no less
 than 100,000kg!) (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, pp. 16-19), which served as the
 attracting weight and which was posited between the upper and lower balance scales.
 This block increased the weight of the masses in the upper scale and decreased the

 weight of the masses in the lower scales.

 The general outcome of Richarz and Krigar-Menzel's experiments (in total 52)

 established that the average difference in weight in the absence of the lead weight
 is 1.2453 ± 0.0016 mg and that, when the lead weight is installed at its appropri-
 ate position, the average difference in weight is -0.1211 ± 0.0014mg, taking into
 consideration the air which is pushed away by the masses and the required correc-
 tion factor for variations in temperature (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, pp. 67-84,

 esp. p. 83 [temperature correction], pp. 55-66 [correction for the pushed-away air]).
 As the difference between the vertical accelerative forces in the lower and higher

 positionwithout the lead weight,101 gu -go, equals 0.0005183 x (1.2453 ±0.00 16)^
 (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, p. 48, 51) and, analogously, gu- go - (k0 + ku) =

 -0.0005183 x (0.121 1 ± 0.0014)^, it follows from experiment that the total added
 vertical attraction, which is produced by adding the lead weight, ko + ku, equals

 0.0005183 x (1.3664 ± 0.0021)^ (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, p. 84, 110).
 The theoretically derived value for k0 + ku was shown to be equal to 10, 594.0 x G

 Menzel relied on the following formula: A =

 to the gravity in Berlin, i.e. 0.0034672 (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel 1898, p. 1 1 1).

 In this section, we have surveyed how, on the basis of entirely different apparatuses,

 converging and reliable experimental determinations - of varying accuracy and pre-
 cision102 established for the gravitational constant and the mean density of the earth

 (see the summary in Table 2). In other words, in the late nineteenth century, converg-

 ing measurements were established for the strength of the gravitational force and it
 was further confirmed that between terrestrial bodies there were robust gravitational

 interactions. In this section, the author has also brought to the fore how, in each of

 percentage by which these experimental results for the mean density of the earth differ from the present-day
 value are: ca. 0.39% (Poynting), ca. 0.21% (Boys), ca. 0.22 % (Braun), and ca. 0.18 (Richarz and Krigar-

 the discussed experimental setups, efforts were made to ensure the stability of the
 apparatus and to guard against external disturbances - for instance, air currents were

 minimized, variations in temperature, air pressure and humidity were avoided or kept

 constant. As the accuracy and precision of the experimental apparatuses and the pro-

 cedures to eliminate external disturbances involved improved in comparison to those

 discussed in the previous section, the empirical support for the universality of New-
 ton's theory of gravitation improved correspondingly.

 5 On the genesis of stronger evidence

 In the preceding sections, the author has indicated that the evidential support for the

 universality of Newton's law of gravitation became increasingly stronger. Moreover,
 the author has suggested that the increasing accuracy and precision of the values for

 the mean density of the earth and the gravitational constant resulted from a long-term
 learning process, to which generations of experimental physicists contributed, and
 new technological possibilities. Here the author shall expand on these matters.

 A salient feature of a good experimental apparatus is that it produces a stable or

 robust phenomenon in a controlled environment and therefore a reliable outcome.103

 "Control" entails two things: first of all, it refers to the elimination or keeping constant

 of disturbing factors;104 secondly, it refers to the factors, which are varied during the
 experiment, being maximally (quantitatively) determined.

 If we study the development of scientific research on the mean density of the earth

 and ultimately the gravitational constant between 1798 and 1898, it becomes appar-
 ent that experimental physicists became increasingly skilled in eliminating sources of

 error. In this context, Ian Hacking has adequately noted that "serious repetitions of
 an experiment are attempts to do the same thing better - to produce a more stable,
 less noisy version of the phenomenon" (Hacking 1983, p. 231 [italics added]). For

 instance, although Cavendish made explicit attempts to eliminate disturbing factors,

 103 See Knorr-Cetina (1999, esp. pp. 26-28) [on the laboratory as an enhanced environment], Pickering
 (1981, p. 218) [on relatively closed systems], and, Radder (1988, pp. 63-64) [on closed systems].

 104 Peter Galison (Galison 1987, p. 248) records: "Experimental culture is grounded in expertise - the
 ability to eliminate kinds of backgrounds and an instinctive familiarity with the valid limits of an apparatus."

 Baily pointed out that the screening-off procedures in Cavendish' experiment were not

 entirely waterproof and, accordingly, he sought to overcome the problems associated

 with them. As we have also seen, improved experimental skill was not limited to the

 area of elimination of disturbing factors, but equally applied to the area of measurement

 techniques - Baily's improvement of Cavendish' measurement techniques for deter-

 mining the time of vibration and the resting points, which was in its turn criticized by

 Cornu and Bailie, is a notable example of this. New methods for eliminating disturbing

 factors were being devised as new, more fine-tuned scientific apparatuses emerged.
 Also, the number of eliminated factors increased - for instance, (dia)magnetic effects

 (Reich), air pressure (Poynting and Braun), and the humidity of the surrounding air
 (Richarz and Krigar-Menzel) were added to the picture. In addition, as a means of

 compensating for disturbing influences, correction factors were introduced - see, for

 instance, the correction factors introduced in the experiments of Cavendish, Poynting,

 Braun, Richarz, and Krigar-Menzel.

 As we have seen in the previous sections, experiments, which set out to determine

 the attractive force between two known bodies at a known distance, were more success-

 ful than experiments which relied on an undetermined factor. Recall the uncertainty

 of the density of the outer shell of the earth implicated in Airy 's and Sterneck's exper-

 iments with pendulums at and below the surface of the earth. Varying specific factors

 was equally important,105 for by doing so it was possible to track potential sources of
 error - in case the varied factors made a difference - or to add to the stability of the

 phenomena at hand - in case the varied factors made no difference.

 The fact that the independently established determinations of the mean density of

 the earth and the gravitational constant increasingly converged, added to the evidence

 that there are gravitational interactions between terrestrial bodies. In short, the physi-

 cists surveyed in this article had become better experimenters and their work provided

 increasingly stronger evidence for the universality of Newton's theory of gravitation.

 6 Newton's postscript

 In the analytic part of the proof for universal gravitation, Newton set out to proceed
 "from Motions to the Forces producing them; and in general, from Effects to their
 Causes, and from particulars Causes to more general ones" (Newton 1979, p. 404). In

 Propositions I-V of Book III of the Principia, Newton inferred the forces acting in the

 solar system and in Propositions VI-VIII of Book III he derived the theory of universal

 gravitation. The remainder of the Principia pertained to "the Method of Synthesis," i.e.
 "assuming the Causes discover'd and establich'd as Principles, and by them explain-
 ing the phaenomena proceeding from them, and proving the Explanations" (Newton
 1979, pp. 404-^405). Accordingly, in the synthetic part of the argument for universal

 gravitation, Newton set out to demonstrate that other phenomena, which were not con-
 tained in the original analysis, could be explained by the causes as established by the

 theory of universal gravitation. The research surveyed in this essay was a continuation

 of Newton's synthesis in the Principia. If it could be established that there are robust

 Testing universal gravitation in the laboratory 221

 gravitational interactions between laboratory-sized bodies, which were obviously not

 originally included in Newton's analysis, this would add to the empirical support for

 Newton's theory of universal gravitation. Although it is not his present aim to explicate

 Newton's complex physico-mathematical methodology, the author shall, in order to

 contextualize his claim on the long-term experimental-methodological continuity as
 exhibited in the branch of post-Newtonian science which we have surveyed in this

 essay, briefly point to some salient features of Newton's Principia-style method.106

 In contrast to the hypothetico-deductivist's attitude towards deviations, according
 to which deviations are either discarded or explained away by the introduction of ad
 hoc factors, Newton made discrepancies between phenomena and the mathematical
 results derived from ideal conditions a focal point of natural-philosophical enquiry.

 Newton began by establishing the physical conditions under which - according to the
 laws of motion - exact Keplerian motion would occur, so that each deviation from

 exact Keplerian motion is an indication that there is an additional force to the one under

 which exact Keplerian motion would occur. For instance, from the perspective of the

 laws of motion, any deviation from exact time-area proportionality is seen as an indi-

 cation that an additional force, not included in our ideal case, is affecting the situation.

 Deviations thus become indicative of other forces not tracked in our initial approxima-

 tion. By means of the propositions expressing systematic discrepancies, Newton was
 able to measure such additional forces and to trace, in Book III, additional physical
 sources that could account for these very discrepancies.

 Moreover, in contrast with a hypothetico-deductive rendering of theory confirma-

 tion, in which the confirmation of the consequences deduced from a theoretical prop-

 osition by itself occupies centre stage, in Newton's methodology the attention shifts

 to a continuous exploration of residual forces and the establishment of their potential

 explanation. A striking feature of Newton's method is that he did not approach the

 empirical world through a single theoretical model or equation, but rather through a
 series of successive approximations.107 This is captured by Newton's fourth rule of
 philosophizing, which was introduced in the third edition of the Principia (1726):

 RULE IV.

 In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by induc-

 tion should be considered [haberi debent'either exactly or very nearly true not-

 withstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena make such
 propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions [accuratiores reddantur
 aut exceptionibus obnoxiœ].
 This rule should be followed so that arguments based on induction may not be
 nullified [tollatur] by hypotheses. (Newton 1999, p. 796)

 In manuscript material Newton was more explicit on the meaning of this rule.
 "Because," Newton wrote in a crossed-out section on what was there and then called

 "Reg. V:" "if arguments based on hypotheses were to be admitted against inductions,

 then inductive arguments, on which the whole of experimental philosophy is based,

 106 The author must stress that the features that he shall mention are not at all exhaustive.

 could always be overturned by contrary hypotheses."108 If a proposition gathered by

 induction is not sufficiently accurate, then it should be corrected, not by (introducing ad

 hoc) hypotheses, but by more widely and accurately observed phenomena ornature. 109

 If this turns out impossible, however, the proposition should be de-generalized.1 10 The

 latter quote also reveals that Newton was perfectly aware of the risk involved in making

 inductive generalizations. Inductive-experimental arguments do not provide demon-

 strations, but they are stronger than arguments drawn from hypotheses (Newton 1979,

 p. 404). Whilst a hypothetico-deductivist endorses the view that a theoretical propo-

 sition is confirmed when the deductions from that proposition are agreeable with the

 phenomena at hand, Newton demanded more from a theory than empirical adequacy:

 in order to be accepted (provisionally), it should also be demonstrated that independent
 measures converge to a stable value (Harper 1998, p. 278; Harper 2002, p. 185).

 The question which was put on the plate of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century

 experimental physics was whether Newton's theory of gravitation could be rendered
 "more exact" or whether its presumed universality had to be de-generalized. The

 research referred to in this essay, had indeed shown that the former could be reasonably

 accomplished. In addition, it had been shown that independently established measure-

 ments of the mean density of the earth and the gravitational constant increasingly con-

 verged. Insofar as the call for increasing accuracy and convergence of independently

 established measurements may be considered as being characteristic of Newton's nat-

 ural-philosophical methodology, the author has brought to the fore that in the long

 run a particular branch of post-Newtonian research developed in line with Newton's

 methodological views.1 1 1 Given what the author has discussed in the previous section,

 he has also shown that, whereas in the context of Book III of the Principia1 12 increased

 accuracy resulted primarily from the introduction and exploration of increasingly com-

 plex physico-mathematical approximations, in the branch of post-Newtonian science

 which was the focal point of this essay increased accuracy resulted primarily from the

 experimenters' capacities to more carefully eliminate sources of external disturbances.

 108 "Nam si argumenta ab Hypothesibus ¿contra InductionesJ, admitterentur, argumenta fib Inductions
 |um4 in quibus tota Philosophia experimentalis fundatur nihil valerent, sed ¿Nam| per Hypotheses con-
 trarias semper everti possent." (CUL Add. Ms. 3965, f. 419V [additions and corrections to the second edition
 of the Principia])

 109 Cf. "Si Propositioned ¿aliquaj, per Inductionem collectla^« nondum s|it|«ftt satis accurati aj,«,
 corrigi debent, non per hypotheses, sed per phenomena naturae fusius & accuratius observa4,t|«éa." (CUL
 Add. Ms. 3965,f.419v).

 110 Cf. "Argumenta ab|per| Inductione|m| «e» [fortiora sunt quam Hypotheoes non sunt Demonstrati-
 ones. ffortiora tarnen sunt quam Hypotheses: & pro generalibus haberi debent nisi quatenus exceptiones ab

 experimentis desumptae [illegible text] occurrant. Ideoque ubi nullae occurrunt ejusmodi «bi-etext cepti-
 ones, generaliter ennunciandae sunt." (CUL Add. Ms. 3965, f. 428r [additions and corrections to the second
 edition of the Principia]).

 1 ' ] The italics added are meant to convey that my claim is not that the protagonists in this story self-

 consciously incorporated the specifics of Newton's methodology (as they can be found in Newton's intro-
 duction to the Principia, the Scholium to Proposition XI of Book I, the General Scholium, or the concluding

 parts of Query 31 in The Opticks) in their work. In fact, in the material the author studied in the context of
 this essay, the author found no evidence to support such claim.

 1 12 Hereby, the author does not wish to minimize the experimental parts in Sect. 6, which deals with the
 motions of pendulums, and Sect. 7, which deals with free fall motion in the air, of Book II.
