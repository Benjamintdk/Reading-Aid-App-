 Abstract Before the discovery of the expanding universe, one of the challenges
 faced in early relativistic cosmology was the determination of the finite and constant

 curvature radius of space-time by using astronomical observations. Great interest in

 this specific question was shown by de Sitter, Silberstein, and Lundmark. Their ideas

 and methods for measuring the cosmic curvature radius, at that time interpreted as

 equivalent to the size of the universe, contributed to the development of the empiri-

 cal approach to relativistic cosmology. Their works are a noteworthy example of the

 efforts made by modern cosmologists toward the understanding of the universe as a
 whole, its properties, and its content.

 1 Introduction

 A historical reconstruction of some attempts to determine the cosmic curvature radius

 by means of astronomical observations is presented in the following. The framework is

 that of the early phase of the science of the universe in the modern accepted meaning,
 from the beginning of relativistic cosmology in 1917 to the diffusion of theoreti-
 cal models describing the expanding universe in 1930. Some leading scientists, who
 participated in the debate at that time, investigated the measurable properties of the

 universe, which was assumed to be static. In the light of the relativistic interpretation

 of the curvature of space-time, they speculated on the finite dimension of the universe,

 and, in this sense, attempted to extrapolate the size of the universe, i.e., the value of

 the cosmic curvature radius. After mentioning the very first suggestion in relativistic

 cosmology offered by Albert Einstein (1879-1955) on the value of the world radius,
 we focus on the analysis carried out by Willem de Sitter (1872-1934), who obtained

 a rough measure of the curvature radius of space-time. We then examine the different
 works in this field by Ludwik Silberstein (1872-1948) and Knut Lundmark (1889-

 1958). Finally, we give an overview of further investigations on the topic carried out

 before the discovery of the expanding universe. The variety of methods to obtain the
 curvature radius and corresponding estimates is summarized in Table 2. The aim of

 this article is to illustrate how the ideas, methods, and results proposed to measure the

 world radius can be read as noteworthy contributions to the first interplay between

 some of the speculative predictions of modern cosmology and the increasing amount

 of pertinent empirical evidence from the observable part of the universe.

 The first two pioneering and rival cosmological solutions of relativistic field equa-

 tions, formulated in 1917 by Einstein and by de Sitter, were the main focus of interest

 during the early phase of relativistic cosmology. These solutions represented by their

 intention a static universe with finite curvature radius. The Einstein universe was spher-

 ical and filled with matter, whereas the hyperboloidal (or equivalently hyperspherical)

 model of de Sitter was empty of matter and radiation. The possibility of extrapolating

 the radius of the universe (hereafter denoted by R) from observations was recognized

 as one of the interesting astronomical consequences of general relativity. However,
 such a quest represented an issue of secondary importance with respect to the inves-

 tigation of the different properties of Einstein's and de Sitter's models in that period.

 Actually, during the Twenties, the first link between theoretical cosmology and

 observational astronomy was mainly concerned with the interpretation of the displace-
 ment of wavelengths measured in spectra of stars, globular clusters, and especially
 spiral nebulae. The discovery of the expanding universe arose from the search for a
 suitable relation between observable quantities such as spectral shifts, distances, and

 apparent diameters. It was especially de Sitter's empty universe which attracted interest

 among scientists since it offered a (rather puzzling) interpretation of spectral displace-

 ments measured in stars and spiral nebulae. With regard to the content of the universe,

 Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) proved in 1925 the very existence of spiral nebulae as truly

 extragalactic stellar systems. The subsequent consensus about the status of spirals thus

 marked the change from the conception of a universe made of stars and nebulae to the

 picture of a universe filled with galaxies (nowadays, galaxy clusters and superclusters

 are regarded as the fundamental pieces which contribute to the matter content of the
 universe). The transition to the expanding universe took place when Hubble himself,
 in collaboration with Milton Humason (1891-1972), provided the empirical evidence
 that distant galaxies receded from each other: in 1929 Hubble confirmed that a lin-
 ear relation, later known as the "Hubble law," existed between redshift and distance

 of extragalactic nebulae. From 1930 on, such a discovery subsequently allowed the
 acceptance and the diffusion of the relativistic non-static and non-empty models of
 the universe, which had been formulated already in 1922 by Aleksandr Friedmann
 (1888-1925), and independently in 1927 by Georges Lemaitre (1894-1966). Eventu-
 ally, it was in 1930 that the cosmological interpretation of redshift in spirals as due to

 the expansion of the universe, first proposed by Lemaitre in 1927, officially entered
 modern cosmology.

 After the discovery of the expanding universe, the concept of a finite and con-

 stant world radius was superseded by the notion of the curvature radius depending on

 time R(t), which later evolved to the present notion of the time-dependent expansion
 parameter a(t), also called cosmic scale factor.1

 In this picture, the efforts made in the period 1917-1930 to specify the spatial

 extent of the universe represent a short but significant chapter in the history of the

 early development of relativistic cosmology. The present article intends to show the

 intrinsic interest and the reactions that the quest for the size of the universe stimulated

 in those years.2 de Sitter, Silberstein, and Lundmark ventured the path, now in the

 new framework of relativistic cosmology, of directly estimating R by using several

 astronomical objects, which, by their intention, played the role of distance indicators.

 Going beyond Einstein's first attempt, these authors used either observations of stars,

 or assumptions on the mean density of matter, or velocities of globular clusters and

 spiral nebulae in order to determine the value of R. Indeed the study of distant galaxies

 during the Twenties marked a turning point in the empirical approach to cosmology.
 In this context, the use of distance indicators such as stars and globular clusters was

 soon after recognized as not relevant to search for the curvature of space and to dis-

 tinguish between cosmological models. Nevertheless, the attempts made by de Sitter,
 Silberstein, and Lundmark influenced the early debate about the observational tests

 of the first relativistic world models. Moreover, such attempts can be considered as

 valuable aspects of the broader scientific aim to interpret empirical evidence on astro-

 nomical scales through the laws of physics.

 The analysis given in the following pages will highlight the different approaches

 and the significance such authors attached to the science of the universe. On the one

 hand, we shall see, de Sitter inaugurated in his works the systematic attempt to relate

 astronomical observations from available data to the geometry of the entire universe
 in the framework of general relativity. He studied different methods to determine
 the world radius of both Einstein's universe and of his empty model. Nonetheless,

 de Sitter clearly argued for the very speculative meaning of investigating the universe
 as a whole, claiming that all conclusions drawn beyond observations had to be consid-

 ered pure extrapolations. On the other hand, Silberstein addressed in 1924 the question

 of the determination of the curvature radius of de Sitter's space-time by means of globu-

 lar clusters. He firmly denied the general cosmic recession of test particles in de Sitter's
 universe, which had been predicted in 1923 both by Arthur Eddington (1882-1944)

 1 In modern cosmology, the expansion parameter a(t ) is related to the Gaussian curvature Cq = '>

 The parameter k determines the constant curvature of spatial sections. It can be negative {k = - 1 ), null
 (k = 0), or positive ( k = +1), yielding respectively an open universe (3-dimensional hyperbolical space),
 a flat universe (Euclidean space) or a closed universe (3-dimensional spherical space). In fact, the curvature
 parameter can be scaled in such a way to assume only the values k = (1 , 0, - 1). The parameter a(t ) thus
 represents the radius of spatial curvature, which in cosmology describes the modulus of Gaussian curvature

 radius Rq = (Coles and Lucchin 2002, 9-13).

 This study is mainly based on Chaps. 5 and 6 of: Realdi (2009), from which some parts have been taken,

 and here adapted.

 and independently by Hermann Weyl (1885-1955). Silberstein formulated a theoreti-

 cal linear relation between shift and distance, which he applied to the observed receding

 and approaching motions of globulars. Lundmark showed that the result obtained by

 Silberstein was not correct. In his detailed empirical analysis on some classes of stars
 and spiral nebulae, Lundmark proposed several values of the curvature radius of de
 Sitter's universe, and, in agreement with the cosmology of Carl Charlier (1862-1934),

 suggested the picture of a hierarchical distribution of stars and nebulae.

 With its focus on the specific question of early attempts to estimate the value of

 the cosmic curvature radius before the discovery of the expanding universe, the pres-

 ent analysis offers an additional point of view supplementing those given in the vast

 scientific literature, which already exists on the history of the early developments of
 modern cosmology (see for instance Ellis 1989, 1990; Hetherington 1996; Kerszberg
 1989; Kragh and Smith 2003; North 1965; Nussbaumer and Bieri 2009; Osterbrock
 1990; Smith 1982, 2009).

 2 Einstein, the cosmological constant, and the curvature radius

 In 1917, as mentioned above, Einstein and de Sitter proposed two different cosmo-
 logical solutions of relativistic field equations. Incidentally, it was in the same year

 that the Hooker 100-inch (2.5 m) telescope, the instrument which was used by Hubble

 during the following years for his capital contributions to observational cosmology,

 saw "first light" on Mount Wilson, California.3

 The origin of inertia can be viewed as the main question, which actually led Ein-

 stein and de Sitter to the formulation of their respective models of the universe.4 In
 his famous paper Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativitatstheorie
 ( Cosmological considerations in the general theory of relativity), which appeared in

 February 1917, Einstein proposed a finite and unbounded universe, where the spatial
 sections at constant time were spherical, with constant positive curvature radius R.

 Accounting for the complete material origin of inertia, as inspired by some ideas of
 Ernst Mach (1838-1916), such a closed universe involved that inertia was uniquely

 determined by the interaction between masses. In this way, Einstein achieved what
 he called the relativity of inertia, i.e., he avoided the necessity of assuming that any
 independent property of space could be claimed to be at the origin of inertia. Fur-
 thermore, by means of the spatial closedness he overcame the difficulty of obtaining

 values of the gravitational potentials (identified by the symbols g^v) which at infinity
 were invariant for all transformations.

 Einstein disregarded local non-homogeneous distributions of matter (like stars and
 planets), and introduced in his model an extremely small density of matter which
 hypothetically was uniformly and homogeneously distributed through space. It is
 worth noting that the assumption of global average properties of matter, when consid-

 4 The debate between Einstein and de Sitter, which marked the beginning of relativistic cosmology, is
 analyzed in: The Einstein-de Sitter-Weyl-Klein debate , in Einstein (1998, 351-357). The authors of this
 article reconstructed part of the Einstein-de Sitter correspondence in Realdi and Peruzzi (2009).

 ering cosmological scales, turned out to be one of the typical features in the modern

 approach to cosmology. The condition of the homogeneity and isotropy is now referred

 in the literature as the "cosmological principle": matter and radiation are assumed to

 be uniformly distributed through space on very large scales, with neither privileged

 directions, nor privileged positions. In the present picture of the expanding universe,
 the cosmological principle asserts that the universe exhibits the same properties at
 any given cosmic time, i.e., that the 3-space surfaces of constant cosmic time are
 homogeneous and isotropic.

 Einstein introduced in his field equations the so-called cosmological term,

 which, by his intention, acted like an anti-gravity term and accounted for the supposed

 static equilibrium of the universe. At the beginning of the last century, in fact, astro-
 nomical observations did not (yet) reveal any large-scale systematic velocity fields.

 With the cosmological constant, the relativistic field equations, which relate the space-

 time geometry (on the left-hand side) to the energy-matter content of space-time (on

 the right-hand side), took the form:

 G fiv - -giivG - kgfiv = ~~KTfiV. (1)

 Here is the Ricci tensor, i.e., the contracted Riemann curvature tensor, Q is the

 Ricci scalar, i.e., the scalar curvature obtained from X 8^v , and T^v is the energy-
 momentum tensor; k is a constant equal to where c is the speed of light and G
 is the gravitational constant. In this way, the metric of a static and closed universe
 now resulted as a coherent solution of modified field equations. This was the "rough

 and winding road" (Einstein 1917, 423), which Einstein acknowledged he followed in

 order to show that the theory of general relativity led to a system free of contradictions.

 The value of the cosmological constant k was related to R , and to the mean density

 of world matter p (Einstein 1917, 431):

 >-z-sr-

 By means of such a relation, Einstein derived the first estimate of R in the framework

 of relativistic cosmology. This estimate was not reported in his 1917 cosmological
 paper, but can be found in some correspondence (Einstein 1998, docs. 298, 300, 306,
 308, 31 1). In these letters, Einstein reported that, from star counts, the spatial density

 of matter was of the order of p ~ 10~22 g/cm3. Therefore, from the previous relation
 the world radius of his model was R = 107 light-years (6 x 1011 AU).5 The farthest
 visible stars, Einstein remarked, were estimated at 104 light-years (6 x 108 AU).

 Later on, Einstein showed interest in the possibility of determining the value of

 the cosmological constant. Although such an estimate would directly reveal the value
 of the curvature radius, Einstein was mainly interested in the confirmation of the

 5 The astronomical unit ( AU) and the light-year are units of distance in astronomy and cosmology. The astro-

 nomical unit corresponds to nearly 1 .49 x 101 1 m, whereas the light-year is approximately 9.42 x 1015 m,
 or roughly 63,272 AU. Another unit of distance is the parsec (pc), equal to 3.09 x 1016 m (1 pc = 206,264.8
 AU ~ 3.26 light-years).

 existence in nature of the cosmological constant, which, by quoting Einstein himself,

 "is not justified by our actual knowledge of gravitation" (Einstein 1917, 432), and
 which he had only introduced in 1917 to account for a static universe. A hint about

 this question can be found in some considerations which Einstein proposed in 1921 on

 the application of the Newtonian law of gravitation to globular clusters, and on the sta-

 tionary equilibrium of such stellar systems (Einstein 1921a, 394-395, Einstein 1921b).

 In this framework, Einstein referred to some observations made by Erwin Freundlich6

 (1885-1964). In fact, the comparison between the observed stellar velocities and the

 average theoretical velocity of stars (the latter obtained through the virial theorem in
 the case of Newtonian forces) would have possibly revealed the presence of a non-

 zero cosmological constant, which acted like an anti-gravity, and was thus able to keep

 the equilibrium of globular clusters. However, such an attempt, which is thoroughly
 analyzed in the related notes of Einstein (1921b), did not give reliable results.7

 3 The size of the universe according to de Sitter

 The second relativistic model of the universe was proposed by de Sitter right after
 Einstein's 1917 cosmological paper was published. As discussed above, in Einstein's

 universe the world matter, uniformly distributed through space, was the only thing

 responsible for the origin of inertia, and the cosmological constant was necessary for

 a static world model. On the contrary, in his own model, de Sitter assumed that the
 contribution of the density of matter could be disregarded on the largest scales. The
 Dutch astronomer retained in his solution the A-term, which was now responsible for

 the curvature of space-time and for the inertia of a hypothetical test particle inserted
 in such a world free of matter.

 In fact, de Sitter developed a suggestion by Paul Ehrenfest (1880-1933), and

 extended Einstein's hypothesis of a finite 3-dimensional space to a finite 4-dimensional
 space-time of positive constant curvature. This model corresponded to a hyper-
 sphere embedded in Euclidean space, or, equivalently, to a hyperboloid embedded
 in Minkowski space-time. In such a model, the curvature radius was related to the
 cosmological constant through the relation (Einstein 1998, doc. 313):

 l=b (3)

 de Sitter took into account the cosmological term in order to satisfy what he called the

 mathematical postulate that at infinity the potentials were invariant under all trans-

 formations, a postulate which, according to de Sitter himself, did not have any real

 6 We refer to Crelinsten (2006) for a historical reconstruction of the attempts made by astronomers to test

 Einstein's theory of relativity; see Hentschel (1994) for the role played by Freundlich in testing relativity

 7 In 1 93 1 , confronted with the empirical evidence that galaxies were receding from each another, Einstein

 abandoned the cosmological constant which he had introduced in 1917 in order to express in general rela-
 tivity the static nature of the universe. In fact, this hypothesis was contradicted by the observed recession

 of spiral nebulae which now supported the interpretation of the expanding universe (Einstein 1931). For a
 historical account of the cosmological constant, see Earman (2001).

 physical meaning. It is for this purpose that he proposed a cosmological solution where

 all g^v were zero, i.e., an empty model of the universe. As de Sitter wrote in 1932, the
 cosmological constant was "a name without any meaning, which (...) appeared to have

 something to do with the constitution of the universe; but it must not be inferred that,

 since we have given it a name, we know what it means. (...) It is put in the equations in

 order to give them the greatest possible degree of mathematical generality" (de Sitter
 1932b, 121). On the one hand, as a matter of fact, de Sitter clearly acknowledged

 the importance of the mathematical solutions that general relativity now offered for
 studying the universe as a whole. On the other hand, however, he pointed out that
 such investigations were built upon pure hypothesis which could never be proven by

 empirical evidence since they referred to unobservable parts of the universe, and thus

 corresponded to extrapolations beyond our neighborhood which "can not be decided
 by physical arguments, but must depend on metaphysical or philosophical consider-
 ations" (de Sitter 1917a, 1222).

 An interesting hint of this feature of de Sitter's approach to the cosmological ques-

 tion can be found in the original manuscripts written by the Dutch astronomer at the

 very early stages of relativistic cosmology. We mention for instance some notes on
 general relativity reported by de Sitter after conversations in Leiden between Ein-
 stein, de Sitter himself, Ehrenfest, and Gunnar Nordstrom (1881-1923) on September

 28-29, 1916. Actually, this first exchange on the problem of boundary conditions
 (which some months later Einstein solved by introducing a finite universe, whereas de

 Sitter solved it by considering that all potentials at infinity should be zero) marked the

 beginning of the debate between Einstein and de Sitter on the relativistic description
 of the universe as a whole, de Sitter wrote in late 1916 that:

 Einstein wants the hypothesis of the closedness of the world. He means by that
 he makes the hypothesis (conscious that it is a hypothesis which cannot be

 proven) that at infinity (that is at very large, mathematically finite, distance, but

 further than any observable material object (...)) there are such masses (...) that
 the at infinity assume certain degenerate values (these have not to be 0, that
 is a priori not to be said), the same in all systems. (...) He is even prepared to
 give up the complete freedom of transformation (...). If it is possible to find

 a set of degenerate values of the g^v, that is invariant for a not too restricted
 group of transformations, is a question that can be solved mathematically.
 Is the answer no (what Ehrenfest and I expect), then Einstein's hypothesis of

 the closedness is untrue. Is the answer yes, then the hypothesis is not incompat-

 ible with the relativity theory. However, I even then maintain my opinion that it

 is incompatible with the spirit of the principle of relativity. And Einstein admits

 that I have the right to do so. Also the rejection of the hypothesis is completely

 admissible in the relativity theory8 (de Sitter 1916b).

 8 "Einstein wil de hypothese van de afgeslotenheid der wereld. Hij verstaat daaronder dat hij de hypothese
 maakt (bewust dat het een onbewijsbare hypothese is) dat er in het oneindige (d.i. op zeer groote,
 mathematisch eindige, afstand, maar verder dan eenig waarneembaar materieel object, (...)) zooda-

 In addition to these considerations, some 1917 correspondence with Jacobus
 Kapteyn (1851-1922), whom de Sitter asked for advice right during his debate with

 Einstein, reveals the great importance de Sitter attached to the actual picture drawn

 by the astronomical investigation of the observable part of the universe, which, as we

 shall see later, was helpful when comparing the different astronomical consequences
 between his own model and Einstein's, de Sitter was interested in the most recent

 advances on parallax measures and estimates of the total mass of the Milky Way.
 Furthermore, he paid special attention to whether observations of stars and nebulae
 revealed a nearly systematic redshift. "These are hard nuts - Kapteyn replied to de
 Sitter in June 1917 - you are giving me to crack" (van der Kruit and van Berkel 2000,
 96).

 In his papers, de Sitter studied the properties of Einstein's universe, which he labeled

 as "system A," and those of his own empty model, labeled as "system B." He took into

 account for the sake of comparison also the properties of the solution of field equa-
 tions without X, i.e., of the line element of the special theory of relativity ("system

 C"). de Sitter proposed several forms of the line element of his cosmological solution,

 which depended on the choice of coordinates. In one of these, which became known
 as the "static form" of de Sitter's universe, the metric was the same as in Einstein's

 spherical model, except for the potential term which referred to the time coordinate

 t. In Einstein's world such a potential was gtt = 1, whereas in the static form of de
 Sitter's universe such a potential term depended on the variable r (interpreted as a
 radial coordinate) and on the radius R (de Sitter 1917b, 230):

 gtt - cos2 (4)

 Rather than a spherical space, de Sitter assumed for his universe that the physical
 (closed) space was elliptical. Such a choice, in fact, avoided the existence of the antip-

 odal point which one observes in the spherical space, where any two geodesies intersect

 each other in two points. To imagine the difference between these two spaces, one can
 consider on the one hand the analogy between spherical space and the surface of a
 sphere, on the other hand the analogy between elliptical space and the surface of a
 hemisphere (Harrison 2000, 202). The volume of the elliptical space (n R 3) is half of
 the volume of the spherical one, and both of these spaces can be approximated to the
 Euclidean space for small values of r compared to R , the curvature radius.9

 The quest for the size of the universe 667

 It is clear that in the framework related to the investigation of the astronomical

 consequences of general relativity, de Sitter showed great interest in the determination

 of the curvature radius of space-time by means of observational evidence.

 The first difference between the two relativistic cosmological models A and B

 emerged by considering trigonometric parallax.10 In the framework of the use of
 parallax to measure the curvature of space, a lower limit of the curvature radius,
 R > 4 x 106 AU, had been proposed already in 1900 by Karl Schwarzschild (1873-
 1916). In fact, in his pre-relativistic analysis on curved spaces,11 Schwarzschild had
 assumed that some stars had trigonometric annual parallax of the order of p = 0".05
 (Schwarzschild 1900, 2541). As confirmed by Kapteyn in a letter to de Sitter, such a

 limit for annual parallax was still in 1917 the most suitable result obtained by direct
 observations (van der Kruit and van Berkel 2000, 96). As remarked by de Sitter:

 The meaning [of observed parallaxes] is of course actually measured parallax-
 es, not parallaxes derived by the formula p = a/ r from a distance which is
 determined from other sources (comparison of radial and transversal velocity,

 absolute magnitude, etc.). Schwarzschild assumes that there are certainly stars

 having a parallax of 0".05. All parallaxes measured since then [1900] are relative

 parallaxes, and consequently we must at the present time still use the same limit
 (de Sitter 1917b, 234).

 de Sitter proposed alternative ways to determine the cosmic curvature radius. With

 regard to Einstein's spherical universe, an estimate of R was obtained by means of the
 relation between the angular (apparent) diameter 8 of an object of linear (absolute)
 diameter d at the distance r from the Sun. "It is very probable - de Sitter wrote in

 1917 - that at least some of the spiral nebulae or globular clusters are galactic systems
 comparable with our own in size" (de Sitter 1917c, 24). By taking, for example, for
 these systems d = 109 AU and 8 = 5', de Sitter asserted that the radius of system A
 was R > 1012 AU.

 Furthermore, the size of Einstein's universe was obtained by some assumptions on
 the density of world matter p, i.e., by applying the same method first suggested by
 Einstein (de Sitter 1917c, 24). If such a density was assumed to be the same as the star

 density at the center of the galactic system (80 stars/1000 pc3, or p = 10~17 g/cm3),

 then the curvature radius of system A resulted as R = 9 x 1011 AU, not so different
 from the estimate suggested some months before by Einstein. From assumptions on
 the number of galactic systems (7 x 106), on their average shortest distance (1010
 AU), and on the total mass of the world matter sufficient to fill the whole universe

 10 In system B the trigonometric parallax p of a star at the distance r from the Sun was: p ~ ? r =

 a sin ^

 Y-J 1 + a being the average distance between the Sun and the Earth. Thus, here the parallax p was
 never zero, and reached its minimum value at the distance from the Sun r = y R (de Sitter 1917c, 13). In
 system A such a parallax was P - % cot = p, so that p diminished to zero as the distance increased up
 to r = j R, and for larger distances it became negative (de Sitter 1917b, 233).

 with galaxies, the density resulted to be p = ^ x 10~20 g/cm3, so that the radius
 resulted: R < 5 x 1013 AU.

 In addition, as mentioned above, one should expect in system A to see the antipodal

 image of the Sun. Since this was not observed, light should have been absorbed in its

 travel around the world. According to de Sitter, an absorption of 40 magnitudes, which

 had been proposed already in 1900 by Schwarzschild, was sufficient to produce such
 an effect along the distance n R of the spherical space. Therefore, by assuming the

 result by Harlow Shapley (1 885-1972) of an absorption of 0.0001 mag/10 pc, de Sitter

 obtained the value R > ' x 1012 AU for the curvature radius of Einstein's universe
 (de Sitter 1917c, 25).

 With regard to the empty universe, estimates of R could not be obtained by using

 the fact that the "back of the Sun" was not observed. In fact, at the distance r = j R,
 i.e., at the largest possible distance in elliptical space, it was gtt = 0. Therefore, as
 de Sitter pointed out, in such a system "light requires an infinite time for the voyage

 round the world" (de Sitter 1917c, 26). Moreover, the relation between apparent and

 linear diameter of spirals could not be applied in system B, since at this distance the

 apparent angular diameter 8 was also zero.

 However, the empty universe showed an interesting feature, allowing de Sitter to

 propose a value of the curvature radius of system B by means of the displacement of

 wavelengths measured in spectra of some stars and spiral nebulae. Since in the static

 form of system B the gtt potential term diminished with increasing r, the frequency

 of light diminished with increasing distances from the observer at rest at the origin of

 coordinates: "the lines in the spectra of very distant objects - de Sitter wrote - must
 appear displaced toward the red" (de Sitter 1917b, 235).

 As usual in those years, the spectral shift z was mainly interpreted as a Doppler

 motion, i.e., as originated by relative motions through space between the observer and

 the observed object. The classic Doppler formula, used when the relative velocity v is
 small when compared to speed of light c, is:

 kQ - ke v

 z =

 Ae C

 where X0 and Xe denote the wavelength measured by the observer and the one emitted
 from the source, respectively. The redshift (or, respectively, blueshift) is due to an
 increasing (decreasing) of wavelength, and is interpreted as a receding (approaching)
 motion of the source, with velocity v.

 One of the relevant phenomena described in Einstein's new theory of gravitation

 was the gravitational shift, i.e., the contribution to the shift of spectral lines produced

 by stars themselves. In fact, spectral lines originating in a strong gravitational field,

 for example on the star's surface, would be displaced toward the red to an observer in a

 weaker gravitational field.12 In his analysis of the gravitational shift de Sitter referred
 to some observations by William Campbell (1862-1938). Already in 1911 Campbell

 12 For a star of mass A/* and density p* (with solar mass and solar density A/© = p@ = 1), such a

 gravitational contribution to the measured spectral shift was equal to 0.634 p'^ (de Sitter 1916a,
 719).

 found that a constant K term, initially interpreted as a systematic error, had to be taken

 into account in order to determine the solar motion from stellar velocities of 35 groups

 of B stars. "An error of obscure source - Campbell wrote in 191 1 - causes the radial
 velocities of Class B stars to be observed too great by a quantity, K , amounting to
 several kilometers" (Campbell 1911, 105). As suggested by Kapteyn to de Sitter, such

 an average systematic shift to the red for B stars corresponded to a receding velocity

 of the order of v = +4.3 km/s (van der Kruit and van Berkel 2000, 97), up to nearly
 v = +4.5 km/s (de Sitter 1916a, 719). de Sitter assumed that almost one-third of this

 shift could be interpreted as the proper gravitational shift due to the source, i.e., at
 the star's surface. The remaining v = +3 km/s corresponded to a "spurious positive
 radial velocity", in the sense that such a displacement of spectral lines was produced

 by the inertial field in system B, and in particular by the diminution of gtt in de Sitter's
 universe (de Sitter 1917c, 26). Then R could be obtained by considering the field
 produced by a fixed star.13 Since the average distance of B stars was r - 3 x 107 AU,

 the curvature radius of the empty model resulted to be R = ' X 1010 AU (de Sitter
 1917c, 27).

 de Sitter further developed such an analysis in relation to some nebulae. Referring to

 data from the 1917 Council of the Royal Astronomical Society (Eddington 1917a), de
 Sitter pointed out that the Small Magellanic Cloud was estimated to be at r > 6 x 109
 AU, with a radial velocity v ~ +150 km/s. Consequently the curvature radius of
 system B was R > 2 x 101 1 AU (de Sitter 1917c, 27). By some independent observa-
 tions, three nebulae (NGC 4594, NGC 1068, and the Andromeda nebula) showed very
 large radial velocities compared with usual velocities of stars in solar neighborhood
 (see Table 1). Taking v = +600 km/s as the mean of their radial velocities, and the

 curvature radius as R = | x 1010 AU, the minimum distance of these nebulae was
 r - 4 x 108 AU (de Sitter 1917b, 236). Alternatively, by assuming for these objects
 a mean distance of about r = 2 x 1010 AU, the curvature radius of system B was
 R = 3 x 1011 AU (de Sitter 1917c, 28).

 13 The relation between R , the star's distance r, and the star's spurious velocity v (obtained by means of
 the Doppler formula) was in this case: gtt = cos2 ~ 1 - 2^ = 1- 2 x 10-5 (de Sitter 1917b, 235).

 de Sitter remarked that the estimates of the curvature radius of system A were very

 uncertain. However, he also acknowledged the scarcer value of the estimates of the size

 of his own universe obtained through the radial velocities of nebulae. Nevertheless, in

 face of the different physical consequences of these world models, he suggested that

 the discovery in the future of a systematic receding radial motion of spirals would

 allow a discrimination between system A and system B. His model, as a matter of fact,

 had the great advantage that it required an apparent positive radial velocity for distant
 objects, and the empirical confirmation of such a recession would suggest adopting
 model B rather than A. This was the concluding remark which de Sitter wrote in
 1920, when he noted that now, thanks to the work of Vesto Slipher (1875-1969), the
 radial velocities of 25 spiral nebulae were known, showing a mean receding motion
 of v = -1-560 km/s. However, de Sitter added that "the decision between these two

 systems must, I fear, for a long time be left to personal predilection" (de Sitter 1920,
 868).

 The Dutch astronomer, who was the director of the Leiden Observatory from 1919

 to 1934, did not deal with the cosmological question in other published papers up to

 1930, and did not participate in the cosmological debates which took place during the
 Twenties. By quoting Eddington, de Sitter was "the man who discovered a universe
 and forgot about it" (Eddington 1934, 925). Nevertheless, further considerations by
 the Dutch astronomer on the determination of the size of the universe can be found in

 some correspondence of the late twenties between him and Frank Schlesinger (1871-
 1943). In December 1929, now in view of Hubble's confirmation of the existence of

 a linear redshift-distance relation among galaxies, de Sitter wrote to Schlesinger that:

 Now there comes a most unexpected and curious coincidence. If we suppose the
 whole world to be filled with spiral nebulae (...), the density becomes 2 • 10~28

 in c.g.s. units, which on first sight be thought not to differ much from empti-
 ness. But if we now take Einstein's own solution A of his field equations, i.e.,
 the solution for a full world, then there is a relation between the radius of the

 universe and the density, and taking for the density 2 • 10~28, the radius is found

 to be 2 • | • 109 light-years (3 • 1013 AU), i.e., practically the same as for the
 empty world!14 In the solution A, however, there is no radial velocity (...). We

 are thus confronted with the mathematical problem: what becomes of the empty

 world B if you fill it with matter. I have not yet been able to solve this problem

 completely but I have reasons to expect that the solution will be intermediate
 between the solution A and B (de Sitter 1929).

 Actually, such an intermediate solution, which interested de Sitter and, as we shall see,

 also Eddington, had been formulated by Lemaitre by 1927, but had passed unnoticed.

 Its important consequences were fully recognized by de Sitter and Eddington in 1930,
 when Lemaitre himself drew the attention of the two scientists to his own cosmo-

 logical solution. In fact, in 1927 Lemaitre had proposed as a solution of relativistic
 field equations a non-empty, homogeneous, and isotropic universe where the spatial

 14 It is interesting to note the remarkable difference between the estimate of the density of world matter
 suggested in 1917 by Einstein, which was p ~ 10-22 g/cm3, and such a value which de Sitter took into
 account in 1929.

 curvature radius increased in time. As shown by Lemaitre, it was the expansion of the

 universe which produced the cosmological redshift of galaxies.

 3.1 The debates on the empty universe and the "de Sitter effect"

 Before 1930 it was the universe of de Sitter which stimulated debates and contro-

 versies, both for its puzzling properties, and for its actual relation to astronomical
 evidences. On the one hand, the static form of the de Sitter empty model showed a

 singularity: on the "equator" at the distance r = j R, as seen above, the potential term
 gtt was zero. Such a feature was criticized by Einstein, who did not accept the model

 formulated by de Sitter as a physical solution, and tried to discard it since it repre-

 sented a counterexample of the relativity of inertia. The empty universe was a sort of

 an anti-Machian world model, where the inertia of a test particle was not determined

 by the world matter. Whereas de Sitter considered that such a surface was physically

 inaccessible to test particles, Einstein advocated the idea that it represented a "mass-

 horizon". According to Einstein, the universe of de Sitter was not really empty, but
 had matter concentrated at this equator. It was Felix Klein (1849-1925) who clarified

 this question, showing that this was a singularity due to the choice of coordinates, not

 a true physical singularity.15

 On the other hand, the de Sitter universe attracted the attention of scientists because,

 despite its lack of matter content, it offered more advantages than Einstein's one with

 respect to the astronomical consequences. In particular, de Sitter's static model offered

 an interpretation of the spectral displacement measured in distant objects by means
 of a twofold contribution. Namely, from de Sitter's analysis it emerged that such a
 cosmological solution predicted a spurious positive velocity of test particles due to
 the inertial field, superimposed to a real relative (Doppler) velocity. The latter contri-

 bution resulted from geodesic equations, and admitted both receding and approaching

 motions.16 It was such a twofold property, later known as the "de Sitter effect", which

 actually played during the Twenties the linking role between the relativistic descrip-
 tion of the universe as a whole and the increasing amount of observational evidence

 of relevant radial velocities of spiral nebulae. As a matter of fact, in 1929 Hubble too

 referred to the possibility that the linear redshift-distance relation, revealed by his

 observations of galaxies, could actually represent the de Sitter effect, "and hence that

 numerical data may be introduced into discussions of the general curvature of space"
 (Hubble 1929, 173).

 The de Sitter universe can be regarded as the precursor of the non-static solutions

 to which attention was drawn after 1930. By quoting Merleau Ponty:

 15 We refer to Einstein (1998, 351-357) and Earman and Eisenstaedt (1999) for critical analysis of such
 discussions on the singularity in de Sitter's cosmological model. For the analysis of horizons in de Sit-
 ter's universe, see Rindler (1956), for a description of horizons in modern cosmology, see Harrison (2000,
 Chap. 21).

 16 By using the radial coordinate r, the first contribution led to a quadratic redshift-distance relation, while

 the latter involved a linear dependence between spectral shift z and distance r with no preference in sign:

 z~^(-^)2±j^. See de Sitter (1933, 195-196) for an analysis of such an effect given by de Sitter himself
 after the discovery of the expanding universe.

 d'une equation batarde, l'univers de de Sitter etait done un curieux compl-
 exe d'equivoques, qui cependant portait l'avenir de la pensee cosmologiques
 (Merleau Ponty 1965, 61).

 Since the geometry of de Sitter's universe is not uniquely specified,17 during the

 Twenties many representations of this solution appeared, which complicated the actual

 interpretation of such a universe. Non-static versions of this empty model were for-
 mulated in 1922 by Kornel Lanczos (1893-1974) (1922), in 1923 by Weyl (1923a),
 in 1925 by Lemaitre (1925), and in 1928 by Howard Robertson (1903-1961) (1928).

 In retrospect, these descriptions of de Sitter's universe correspond to truly expanding

 empty models, where the geometry of spatial sections at constant time is, respectively,
 positive (k = +1; Lanczos) and null ( k = 0; Weyl, Lemaitre, and Robertson) (Ellis
 1990, 100).

 Each of these authors considered the theoretical redshift-distance relation, and

 looked for a proper formulation of the de Sitter effect. In particular, in his 1923

 analysis of the hyperboloidal version of de Sitter's universe, Weyl obtained a relation

 which was roughly linear for small distances compared to R (Weyl 1923b, 230). Weyl

 proposed that in de Sitter's hyperboloid the world lines of test particles belonged to

 a pencil diverging from the past toward the future direction, which involved a gen-
 eral cosmic recession of nebulae in such a universe. This assumption on the choice of

 geodesies and their causal connection became later known as the "Weyl principle."18
 A similar cosmic recession was suggested in the same year also by Eddington in his
 famous book The mathematical theory of relativity, a compendium which later Ein-

 stein himself acknowledged as "the finest presentation of the subject in any language"

 (Douglas 1956, 100). Eddington took into account the properties of the static form of

 de Sitter's universe, and found that a test particle could not remain at rest, but was
 accelerated away because of the presence of the cosmological constant. The prepon-

 derance of positive radial velocities of spirals, as revealed by some new observations

 of Slipher reported in Eddington's book, favored the model of de Sitter in comparison
 to Einstein's universe, which had matter but not motion. However, according to Edd-

 ington, these two rival solutions were "two limiting cases, the circumstances of the
 actual world being intermediate between them, de Sitter's empty world is obviously
 intended as a limiting case; and the presence of stars and nebulae must modify it, if
 only slightly, in the direction of Einstein's solution" (Eddington 1923, 160).

 An attempt to confirm such a cosmic recession was given by Carl Wirtz (1876-

 1939) with regard to the studies of the additional K term found by Campbell for B
 stars. Already in 1916 George Paddock (1879-1955) had investigated the determi-
 nation of the direction of the solar motion by using now the radial motion of spiral
 nebulae, obtaining a K term ranging from +248 to +295 km/s (Paddock 1916, 114).

 Ellis (1990).

 The quest for the size of the universe 673

 Wirtz further developed such an analysis on the velocities of spirals, and found the
 notable value of K = +840 ± 141 km/s (Wirtz 1922, 35 1). In 1924, Wirtz introduced

 de Sitter's cosmology to account for such a large value of the additional K term.
 He assumed that spirals had approximately the same linear diameter, so that their
 observed apparent diameter could be used as a distance indicator. Wirtz analyzed data

 of 42 spiral nebulae, for which both the apparent diameter and the radial velocity were

 known. He found a linear relation between the velocity and the logarithm of apparent

 diameter, which involved that the radial motion of spiral nebulae remarkably increased
 with increasing distance, as predicted by de Sitter's model (Wirtz 1924, 23-24).

 However, in the same year the supposed general recession in the empty universe

 was strongly criticized by Silberstein, whose focus of interest was the determination

 of the curvature radius of de Sitter's space-time.

 4 Silberstein on globular clusters and de Sitter's universe

 Silberstein, a Polish- American physicist, maintained a sceptical approach toward many

 aspects of general relativity, which deserved him the role of one of the main critics of

 Einstein's theory.19

 The determination of the curvature radius of de Sitter's universe was the subject of

 many papers written by Silberstein. Some considerations on the first two cosmological

 models were proposed by Silberstein already during the very early response to Ein-

 stein's new theory of gravitation. For instance, in the paper General relativity without
 the equivalence hypothesis , which appeared in 1918, Silberstein acknowledged that
 the universe of de Sitter was particularly interesting because it did not involve any

 hypothetical world matter, which on the contrary was unavoidable in Einstein's model

 (Silberstein 1918, 105). In this article, Silberstein remarked that the general covariance

 was one of the very strong points of Einstein's theory of gravitation. The cosmological

 solution proposed by de Sitter was therefore preferable to Einstein's universe, since

 it fully achieved this requirement, and was perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, as

 explicitly stated by Silberstein some years later (Silberstein 1930, 67).

 The objection to the world matter was reported by Silberstein also in his 1922 book

 on the theory of general relativity and gravitation. Here Silberstein noticed that, for a

 density of matter of the order of "some thousand suns per cubic parsec", the curvature

 radius of Einstein's universe could not be smaller than 1012 AU, and consequently one

 should admit the existence of 1010 galaxies filling this space. On the contrary, the pos-
 sibility to interpret spectral shifts as predicted by de Sitter represented an "attractive
 piece of reasoning" (Silberstein 1922, 137).

 In order to determine the size of de Sitter's universe, Silberstein used in 1924 an

 approximately linear relation between spectral shift and distance. However, he polem-

 ically criticized the general tendency of particles to scatter in de Sitter's universe, and
 proposed a theoretical relation which was valid for both receding and approaching

 19 For some analysis of Silberstein's approach, see, Desmet (2007); Flin and Duerbeck (2006); Sanchez

 objects. According to Silberstein, the recession in de Sitter's universe formulated by
 Weyl in 1923 was "an arbitrary hypothesis" (Silberstein 1924c, 909); furthermore,
 the "mythical" assumption (Silberstein 1924a, 350) that the world lines belonged to a

 pencil of geodesies diverging toward the future was a "sublime guess, entirely undesir-

 able" (Silberstein 1924c, 909). Eddington's suggestion on a universal scattering of test
 particles was also considered by Silberstein "a fallacy based upon a hasty analysis"
 (Silberstein 1924a, 350).

 In fact, the recession advocated by Eddington and Weyl was contradicted by the

 negative velocities of some spirals. Among them, the blueshift measured in the spec-

 trum of the Andromeda nebula revealed a relevant approaching motion with a veloc-
 ity of the order of v ~ -316 km/s. Therefore, Silberstein based his analysis on the
 observations of globular clusters. Actually, such objects showed both receding and
 approaching motions equally distributed. Furthermore, Silberstein acknowledged that

 the estimates of the radial velocity of globular clusters were known with small probable

 error in comparison to spirals. Moreover, despite the attempts made, among others, by

 Lundmark (1919) and by Ernst Opik (1893-1985) in 1922 to determine the distance of

 the Andromeda nebula, there was not (yet) a general consensus on reliable estimates

 of the distance of spirals.

 In his papers on the size of the universe, Silberstein referred to the works by Shapley

 on the observations of globular clusters and on the estimate of the size of the Milky
 Way. In this respect, the historical reconstruction proposed in Smith (1979, 144) is
 useful to reveal the role played by Shapley, who initially encouraged Silberstein to

 investigate the de Sitter effect, but later showed less interest in his results.

 It is worth recalling that, some years before, Shapley had given a fundamental

 contribution to the comprehension of the structure of the Milky Way. Shapley used

 statistical parallaxes in order to determine the absolute magnitude of some RR Lyrae
 stars, i.e., pulsating variable stars, like Cepheids, which change in brightness with
 a regular period. Shapley was able to estimate the distance of these stars observed
 in globular clusters by means of the period-luminosity relation discovered in 1912
 by Hernrietta Leavitt (1868-1921). In 1919, Shapley set the diameter of our Galaxy
 of about 300,000 light-years (19 x 109 AU). The center of the Galaxy, according to
 Shapley, was 65,000 light-years (4 x 109 AU) far from the Sun, in the direction of
 Sagittarius.20 Furthermore, Shapley furnished several topics against the extragalac-
 tic interpretation of spiral nebulae, which he proposed in 1920 during the so-called
 Great Debate, the famous discussion between himself and Heber Curtis (1872-1942),

 focused on the size of the Milky Way and the nature of spiral nebulae.21 On the one
 hand, Curtis advocated the theory that spirals were truly external galaxies (Curtis
 1920). On the other hand, Shapley remarked that "we have no evidence that some-

 where in space there are not other galaxies; we can only conclude that the most distant
 sidereal organizations now recognized (globular clusters, Magellanic Clouds, spiral

 2U The main features of our Galaxy have not changed much since those proposed in 1 936 by John Plaskett

 ( 1 865- 1 94 1 ). According to Plaskett, the Milky Way is a flat rotating disk, with a diameter of about 1 00,000
 light-years (6 x 109 AU), surrounded by a spherical halo of globular clusters (Plaskett 1936).

 nebulae) cannot successfully maintain their claims to galactic structure and dimen-
 sions" (Shapley 1919, 268).22

 It is worth mentioning that the determination of the distance of Cepheid stars rep-
 resents an important step in the cosmological distance ladder, the construction of
 which is fundamental in astronomy as well as in cosmology. In the present picture,
 the cosmic ladder is made of distinct steps, obtained by using different methods:

 from trigonometric parallax and kinematic methods for distances within the Galaxy,

 to primary and secondary indicators for extragalactic distances, as, for instance, RR

 Lyrae and Cepheid variable stars, Novae, Supergiants, Supernovae, globular clusters,
 HI1 regions (i.e., clouds of ionized hydrogen), brightest cluster galaxies.23 In the
 investigation of astronomical distances, some steps were identified after the discov-
 ery of the expanding universe. In 1930, for instance, Robert Trumpler (1886-1956)

 unambiguously confirmed the existence of the interstellar absorption of light affect-
 ing astronomical observations (Trumpler 1930). In 1934, Walter Baade (1893-1960)
 and Fritz Zwicky (1898-1974) suggested the use of Supernovae as potential distance
 indicators (Baade and Zwicky 1934). In 1952, Baade provided evidence for a new
 calibration of the extragalactic distance scale, based on his discovery in 1944 of the
 existence of two stellar populations, presenting two types of Cepheid variable stars
 (Baade 1944, 1952).24

 Silberstein showed great interest in the possibility to obtain further empirical obser-

 vations. This aspect is revealed for instance by the 1924 correspondence between him-
 self and Walter Adams ( 1 876-1 956), one of the member of the American section of the

 Committee on stellar radial velocities, whom Silberstein (unsuccessfully) asked for

 obtaining velocities of 74 globular clusters. In June 1924, Silberstein wrote to Adams
 that:

 The knowledge of radial velocities of remote objects of ascertainable distance
 became an urgent need, and the (spectroscopic) measurement of these velocities

 should, in my opinion, be incorporated into the programme of your Committee.

 Actually, since the spiral nebulae baffle all attempts at estimating their distance,

 the objects in question are the globular clusters (Silberstein 1924g).

 Silberstein considered the line element of the static form of de Sitter's universe. Despite

 his critical remarks to Weyl's conclusion on the alleged cosmic recession, Silberstein

 used the same general principle formulated in 1923 by Weyl himself, who related the

 spectral shift z to the ratio of the proper time d s of the observer to the proper time

 d sf of the source: z = jp- - 1. Silberstein obtained for what he called "the complete

 z = y l±Jl - C-^- -1, (6)

 / 2'-l/2

 where y = 1 1 - ' f . The positive sign corresponded to receding objects, while
 the negative sign to approaching ones (Silberstein 1924c, 912).

 In such a general formula of the Doppler effect there were two terms: a term
 depending on the velocity v, which was dominant near the observer, and a second
 term depending upon which, according to Silberstein, was significant for very
 remote celestial objects. For near stars, the velocity effect approximated to the special

 relativistic one. On the contrary, for the most distant celestial objects, the relation
 became (Silberstein 1924a, 351):

 (7)

 Silberstein used such a linear relation in order to determine the value of the curva-

 ture radius of de Sitter's world. He took into account radial velocities, both positive
 and negative, and distances of seven globular clusters, and obtained a mean value of
 R = 6 x 1012 AU (Silberstein 1924a, 351). Such a result was almost confirmed by
 using velocity and distance of the two Magellanic Clouds (Silberstein 1924b, 363).

 The most distant spiral which was known at that time, NGC 584, showed a radial

 velocity of about v = +1800 km/s. Therefore, it followed that such an object was
 placed at the distance r = 3.6 x 1010 AU. "Huge as this may seen - Silberstein
 noted - it will be remembered that Shapley's latest estimate of the semi-diameter of

 our galaxy is only four times smaller. (...) Whether these estimates will or will not fit

 into the general scheme of modern galactic and extra-galactic astronomy, is not known

 to me and must be left to the scrutiny of specialists" (Silberstein 1924c, 916-917).

 Later on, Silberstein showed that now, from the velocity and distance of ten objects,

 i.e., eight clusters and the Magellanic Clouds, a linear relation was actually confirmed
 by plotting, as suggested to him by Henry N. Russell (1877-1957), the modulus of
 the redshift: r = 'z' R. Silberstein, however, discarded data belonging to other three
 globular clusters (NGC 5904, NGC 6626, NGC 7089), whose velocities were "suspi-
 ciously small' and did not give a constant curvature radius (Silberstein 1924d, 602).
 From data of these ten objects, the size of the universe, by using the general Doppler
 formula, was of the order of R > 9.1 x 1012 AU, while the approximate linear for-
 mula led to a world radius of de Sitter's universe not exceeding R = 8 x 1012 AU
 (Silberstein 1924e, 819). Silberstein also employed and further elaborated a statistical

 formula in order to get R in terms of the mean z and r of two groups of objects for
 which the mean velocity was the same:

 *2-*? = 3^2 (?2 ~f?)' (8)

 The bars denote average values, and the suffixes the different groups. By splitting

 thirteen objects in two groups of, respectively, seven and six objects, such an analysis

 The quest for the size of the universe 677

 gave R = 7.2 x 1012 AU (Silberstein 1924f, 627). Such a method was criticized
 by Eddington, who pointed out that the derivation of such a formula disagreed with

 Lorentz transformation (Eddington 1924, 747).

 As we shall see in the next section, the Swedish astronomer Lundmark disapproved

 of Silberstein's analysis, which he found objectionable both for the choice of a selected

 number of globular clusters, and for the supposed linear correlation between shift and
 distance. Already in 1924, Lundmark proved that the methods and the results by

 Silberstein were wrong, so that they did not much appeal to scientists involved in the

 early debates on relativistic cosmology. Nevertheless, the effort made by Silberstein

 stimulated further investigations on de Sitter's model, as revealed for instance by the

 1 925 work on this subject by Lemaitre, and later by the contributions of Robertson and
 Richard Tolman (1881-1948), which appeared, respectively, in 1928 and 1929. In this

 respect, it is worth to quote part of the draft of an obituary for Robertson written by

 Lemaitre in 1963. Here Lemaitre returned to his 1925 interpretation of the non-static

 feature of de Sitter's universe, and acknowledged that:

 I was better prepared to accept it following an opinion expressed by Eddington.
 (...) The errors by Silberstein have been very stimulating. I had myself had a

 long discussion with him in 1924 at a British Association Conference in Toronto

 and my work, as possibly later on the work of Robertson, results as a large part
 as a reaction against some unsound aspects of Silberstein's theories (Lemaitre
 1963).

 The interest of Silberstein in this topic culminated in his book The size of the universe ,

 which was written in 1929 and published in 1930, i.e., just at the turning point of the

 discovery of the expanding universe (Silberstein 1930). Here Silberstein collected his
 considerations on relativistic cosmology. He maintained the objection to the general

 tendency of particles to scatter suggested by Weyl, and criticized some measurements

 made by Hubble of the distance of extragalactic nebulae. Silberstein pursued his anal-
 ysis on the static metric of de Sitter's universe, and kept accepting the proposal of
 a theoretical relation valid for both red and blue shifts in order to obtain a constant

 curvature radius (see Table 2 for further estimates of R reported by Silberstein in his

 book). Eddington sharply stated that the views held by Silberstein on a finite and static

 universe were obsolete, being now superseded by the much more interesting proposal
 on the expanding universe made by Lemaitre (Eddington 1930, 850). Silberstein's
 book was later criticized also by Robertson. According to Robertson, Silberstein had

 not been able to account for the "overwhelming preponderance of redshifts" revealed
 by the works of Hubble and Humason (Robertson 1932, 603).

 5 The analysis proposed by Lundmark

 In August 1924 Lundmark wrote a paper on the determination of the curvature radius

 of de Sitter's space-time. The detailed analysis given by Lundmark is a clear example
 of the empirical approach adopted by the Swedish astronomer, based on the accurate

 review of available data, on the systematic comparison of different independent obser-

 vations, and on the prompt use of working hypotheses.

 678 G. Peruzzi, M. Realdi

 Lundmark started his analysis by carefully examining the question of the nature

 of measured shifts, and proved that the spectral displacement was nearly constant for

 16 lines in the Andromeda nebula. Such a shift, according to Lundmark, was thus a

 Doppler one, as well as the shift measured in globular clusters. However, he claimed

 that the origin of such displacements was still uncertain.

 Lundmark was sceptical on the alleged possibility that the motion of globular clus-

 ters showed any effect of the curvature of space-time, and criticized the method pro-

 posed by Silberstein, who "has not given, and will probably not be able to give, any

 justification for the use of the velocities of the globular clusters for a determination

 of /?" (Lundmark 1924, 750). A small K term resulted from the analysis of 18 globular

 clusters, while a larger value was obtained by treating velocities of 43 spiral nebulae.
 Therefore, Lundmark asserted that globulars were nearer than spirals. As a conse-

 quence, spirals could presumably be affected by the curvature of space-time, whereas

 the motion of globular clusters was a real phenomenon, and could not be interpreted

 as the spurious velocity predicted for distant objects by the de Sitter effect. Moreover,
 Silberstein's result was objectionable because of the selected choice of those radial
 velocities of globular clusters which gave a constant value of the curvature radius.
 Lundmark made use of his own observations of 18 globulars, and compared his data

 to Shapley's ones. He claimed that his own analysis superseded the one presented by

 Silberstein, and concluded that there was not any definite correlation between veloc-

 ity and distance. In addition, by hypothetically admitting the validity of Silberstein's
 linear relation, the mean value of the curvature radius resulted to be R ~ 19.7 x 1012

 AU, nearly three times larger than the radius calculated by Silberstein, and in any case

 a still larger radius was likely to be expected.25

 In the second part of his paper, Lundmark dealt with further possibilities to deter-
 mine the radius R by means of several classes of stars, which he used as distance
 indicators. He reviewed data of velocity and distance belonging to 30 Cepheid stars,

 8 Novae, 27 O stars, 29 R stars, 25 N stars, and 31 Eclipsing variables. With regard to

 the distance of Cepheid stars, Lundmark followed the derivation proposed by Shapley,

 who studied their proper motion together with the period-luminosity law. Distances
 of Novae were determined by assuming that the mean absolute maximum magnitude

 had almost a constant value. When the radial velocities were plotted according to the
 corresponding distances, there seemed to be no progression, while, on the contrary,
 one should expect a progression from Silberstein's analysis on the constant curvature
 radius. The average values of the curvature radius found by Lundmark (by applying
 Silberstein's formula to the different classes of objects mentioned above) were 7.5,
 41, 4.0, 6.7, 2.3, 2.7 x 1012 AU, respectively (Lundmark 1924, 756-763).

 The role played by spiral nebulae as distance indicators was the subject of the last

 part of Lundmark's paper, where the Swedish scientist proposed a pioneering empir-
 ical analysis of the relation between the velocity and distance for 44 spiral nebulae.
 Already in 1919, as mentioned before, Lundmark had estimated the distance of the
 Andromeda nebula at 200,000 pc (4 x 1010 AU) by means of the Novae maximum
 brightness method. Now he used such a value as the unit of the distance scale. The

 25 As later noted by Silberstein, in such a 1 924 paper Lundmark erroneously reported the unit of distance
 in km rather than in AU (Silberstein 1925, 285).

 parallax of spirals was obtained by using the working hypothesis "that the apparent
 angular dimensions and the total magnitudes of the spiral nebulae are only depen-
 dent on the distance" (Lundmark 1924, 767). Lundmark also applied the statistical
 method, developed by Silberstein, to two groups of, respectively, 23 and 18 objects,
 which gave R = 2.4 x 1012 AU (Lundmark 1924, 769). However, the conclusion
 reached by Lundmark was that the values of the curvature radius derived from each

 single spiral were exceedingly different, and thus inconsistent. Nevertheless, he found

 that there seemed to be a relation between radial velocity and distance, "although not
 a very definite one" (Lundmark 1924, 768).

 In a subsequent paper, published in 1925, Lundmark offered a complete review
 of the direct and the indirect methods to estimate the distance of spiral nebulae. It

 was at the end of this article that the Swedish astronomer returned to question of the

 extension of the universe. Here he analyzed some of his observations in the light of
 the static, infinite and hierarchical model of the universe supported in those years
 by Charlier, another Swedish astronomer. Recalling some ideas by Johann Heinrich
 Lambert (1728-1777), Charlier proposed that celestial bodies formed gradually
 increasing spherical galaxies:

 - N' stars formed galaxy G' , of order 1 and radius R'
 - N2 galaxies G' formed galaxy G2, of order 2 and radius R2

 and so forth... (Charlier 1925, 186). By means of counts of stars and nebulae, and of

 the apparent dimension of the latter, Charlier obtained the relation:

 Ki- 1

 (9)

 A nearly altered version of such a relation was useful to estimate the distance of the
 Andromeda nebula (NGC 224), since, according to Charlier, spirals were galaxies of
 the second order (Lundmark 1925, 892):

 % R' = M- no)

 R'

 Lundmark found a rough agreement between Charlier's result on the Andromeda dis-
 tance (28 times the diameter of the galactic system), and his own result (32 times
 the galactic diameter). "Our present knowledge - Lundmark thus emphasized - as to
 the space-distribution of the stars and the spirals can be summed up in the statement:
 our stellar system and the system of spiral nebulce are constructed according to the
 conceptions expressed in the Lambert-Charlier cosmogony " (Lundmark 1925, 893).

 6 Further determinations of the curvature radius before the expanding universe

 As seen in the previous sections, at the beginning of relativistic cosmology
 scientists as de Sitter, Silberstein, and Lundmark showed great interest in the deter-
 mination of R. In addition to their systematic analysis in terms of astronomical

 One of the currently accepted estimates of the curvature scale Rc of the universe is Rc > 42 Gpc
 (~ 87 x 10 14 AU). It is worth noting that Rc is now expressed as a function of the Hubble constant
 and the energy-matter density of the universe (for details, see Vardanyan et al. 201 1)

 observations, further considerations on the size of the universe appeared in differ-

 ent frameworks. For instance, Weyl and Eddington took into account the curvature
 radius of space-time in their speculative attempts to connect macro-systems with
 micro-systems, in particular in the perspective of large numbers coincidence.26 In
 fact, Weyl considered the relation between the world radius, the radius of the elec-

 tron, and the gravitational radius associated with a mass m. Eddington, who already
 in August 1917 had emphasized in a letter to de Sitter that "it is very interest-
 ing that you can get a determination of the necessary order of magnitude of R "
 (Eddington 1917b), followed Weyl in this analysis. In 1920, right in the light of
 Weyl's approach on the unification of electricity and gravitation, Eddington argued
 that R of Einstein's world was of the order of 2 x 1011 pc (4 x 1016 AU), "which -
 Eddington noted - though somewhat larger than the provisional estimates made
 by de Sitter, is within the realm of possibility" (Eddington 1920, 179). Later on,
 a numerical value of R was reported by Weyl in the appendix of the fifth edi-
 tion of his Raum, Zeit, Materie. Here Weyl, in the already mentioned investiga-
 tion of the hyperboloidal version of de Sitter's universe, referred to Lundmark's
 result on the distance of the Andromeda nebula, and found that /? = 109 AU:
 the curvature radius was 1040 times the radius of the electron, which was the

 same ratio of this latter to the gravitational radius of the electron (Weyl 1923a,
 323).

 It is worth mentioning Eddington's further attempts to relate the cosmological
 problem to the atomic one. Eddington considered the cosmological constant as one

 of the fundamental entities in nature, together with the fine structure constant, the

 number of particles expected in an expanding universe, and the ratio of electrostatic
 and gravitational forces. For instance, in 1931 Eddington suggested that an estimate

 of X could be obtained by means of the wave equation for an electron, in which both
 the number of electrons in the universe and the time-dependent world radius should
 appear (Eddington 1931). Some years later, Paul Dirac (1902-1984) too followed the
 approach of investigating in the cosmological framework the mathematical relations
 which, according to him, connected the large dimensionless numbers occurring in
 nature (Dirac 1938).

 As a matter of fact, the 1924 authoritative contribution proposed by Lundmark on
 the determination of R revealed that a common criterion for the choice of distance

 indicators was missing. The failure of Silberstein's analysis influenced the cosmo-
 logical debate of the late twenties, in the sense that the interest shown in the size
 of the universe gradually decreased, while the attention of modern cosmologists was
 mainly focused on the nature of spiral nebulae and their role in testing cosmological
 models. Gustaf Stromberg (1882-1962) gave in 1925 a comprehensive analysis of the
 velocity of globular clusters and "non-galactic nebulae". In fact, Stromberg confirmed

 that the interpretation of the relevant redshifts and the form of the redshift-distance

 relation represented an issue still to be clarified (Stromberg 1925). In a 1925 summary
 of the different attempts to measure the size of the universe, Archibald Henderson
 (1877-1963) concluded that:

 26 On the large numbers hypothesis, see for instance Barrow ( 1 990). We refer to Gorelik (2002) for an
 analysis of Weyl's considerations on large numbers in relativistic cosmology.

 If, as now appears probable, the spirals are isolated systems, this recession must

 be explained, it appears, either as a wholesale error or else as a relativistic effect

 (...). Much additional data will be required and many further researches made
 before it will be possible categorically to decide between the infinite, limitless,
 Euclidean universe of Newton, and the finite, unbounded, non-Euclidean uni-

 verse of Einstein and de Sitter (Henderson 1925, 223).

 In this framework, the contributions proposed by Hubble marked a second renewal
 of cosmology. On the one hand, the determination in 1925 of the distance of the
 Andromeda nebula by means of Cepheid variables disclosed the depth of the realm
 of the galaxies (Hubble 1925).27 On the other hand, the linear redshift-distance rela-

 tion, formulated in 1929, held the evidence of a nearly systematic recession of distant
 galaxies (Hubble 1929).

 Actually, between the years 1925-1930, only few suggestions on the dimension of

 the universe appeared in scientific papers. Among them, Hubble proposed a value of
 R of Einstein's universe in the last section of his 1926 paper devoted to the general
 classification of extragalactic nebulae. Here Hubble calculated that the mean density
 of world matter was p = 1.5 x 10~31 g/cm3, which involved that R = 2.7 x 1010 pc
 (5.6 x 1015 AU) (Hubble 1926, 369).

 An estimate of R , as noted in Kragh (2007, 151), was found in the same year by
 Wilhelm Lenz (1888-1957), now in relation to thermodynamics equilibrium. Lenz
 applied to the volume of the Einstein universe the 1925-1926 analysis proposed by
 Otto Stern (1888-1969) on the relation between the energy density of matter, the
 energy density of black body radiation, and the temperature of space. The result,
 which Lenz acknowledged to be of a "fascinating simplicity," was that, at the equilib-

 rium, the matter energy was equal to the radiation energy. The relation proposed by
 Lenz between the temperature T and R was:

 2 1 (2 C2'1/2 1031

 T 2 = ~'

 R'cik ) R

 where a is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and R is expressed in cm. As Lenz noted,

 the density of world matter of the order of 10~26g/cm3 led to R = 1026 cm (6.7 x 1012
 AU), and consequently the black body temperature was too high, about T = 300 K.
 On the contrary, by assuming in such a relation the radiation temperature of 1 K,
 R resulted to be about 1031 cm (6.7 x 1017 AU) (Lenz 1926, 644).

 Two years later, Robertson considered the distance of spirals reported in Hubble's
 1926 paper, in relation to Slipher's data of radial velocity reported in Eddington's 1923

 book on relativity. According to Robertson, these observations were able to confirm a

 nearly linear redshift-distance relation which Robertson had derived by his own non-

 static version of the metric of de Sitter's universe. By means of such data, Robertson
 found the curvature radius of the empty universe to be R = 2 x 1027 cm (1.3 x 1014
 AU) (Robertson 1928, 845).

 27 As noted above, the measurements of the distance of galaxies made by Hubble were reconsidered after
 Baade's discovery of the existence of two different stellar populations.

 The quest for the size of the universe 683

 In 1929, Tolman offered a very detailed analysis of the static form of de Sitter's line

 element, in which he investigated the properties of a formula of the de Sitter effect

 more general than the one previously found by Silberstein. Tolman assumed that R
 would be of, at least, ten times the range of the most distant galaxies: R > 2 x 108

 light-years (1.2 x 1013 AU) (Tolman 1929, 271). Furthermore, in order to reconcile the

 general tendency of scatter in de Sitter's universe, Tolman introduced the hypothesis

 of continuous entry (even continuous formation), namely that "nebulae are continually

 entering, as well as leaving the range of observation", from which he concluded that
 R = 2 x 109 light-years (1.2 x 1014 AU) (Tolman 1929, 272).

 A further estimate of R was proposed yet in 1927, but in a different context, i.e.,

 within the considerations on the time-dependent world radius which appeared in the

 article on the expanding universe written in that year by Lemaitre. As a matter of fact,
 it was Friedmann who first showed in 1922 that Einstein's and de Sitter's solutions

 were "special cases of more general assumptions", and then demonstrated "the pos-
 sibility of a world in which the curvature of space is independent of the three spatial

 coordinates but does depend on time" (Friedmann 1922, 49). However, Friedmann did

 not relate his theoretical predictions to astronomical observations. On the contrary, this

 was done in 1927 by Lemaitre, who took into account empirical data in order to cal-

 culate R(t). In Lemaitre's paper, a partial English translation of which was diffused in

 1931, the Belgian scientist had pointed out that "in order to find a solution combining

 the advantages of those of Einstein and de Sitter, we are led to consider an Einstein

 universe where the radius of space or of the universe is allowed to vary in an arbitrary

 way" (Lemaitre 1 93 1 , 484). The radius R = R(t) asymptotically increased with time,
 starting from Ro = X-1/2, which value depended on the cosmological constant and
 was the radius at t = - oo (Lemaitre 1927, 94). In fact, it was Lemaitre who offered

 in his 1927 paper a solution to the puzzling interpretation of relevant redshifts. He

 clearly stated that such spectral displacements in spirals were a cosmical effect due to

 the variation of R, i.e., to the expansion of the universe. The redshift-distance relation

 valid for near objects was (Lemaitre 1927, 96):

 v R2-R' R'

 z = -c ^ ~nr = ( '

 where R' and R2 were the radius of the universe at the time of emission of a light

 signal, and that at the epoch of reception, respectively and R' referred to the derivative

 of R with respect to time. Lemaitre calculated the distance of 43 nebulae by assuming,
 as done by Hubble in 1926, that they had the same absolute magnitude. The average
 distance he found was r = 106 pc (2 x 1011 AU) (Lemaitre 1927, 96). With regard to
 the radial velocity, the Belgian scientist referred to the observations collected in 1925

 by Stromberg and in 1926 by Hubble, and assumed v = 625 km/s as the average veloc-

 ity at this distance,28 whether the range was between +575 and +670 km/s (Lemaitre

 28 Actually, this can be seen as the first suggestion of the value of what became later known as the "Hubble
 constant," in the sense that here Lemaitre stated that, by assuming the proportionality between v and r, a
 galaxy observed at the distance of 1 Mpc would recede with a velocity of 625 km/s. However, the section

 containing these values and calculation proposed by Lemaitre in 1927 was not reported in the 1931 English
 translation. In 1929, Hubble, unaware of Lemaitre's result, obtained for this constant, i.e., for K term in

 1927, 97). In this way Lemaitre found:

 Rf
 - = y = 0.68 x 10~27 cm-1 , (13)
 R

 from which it followed:

 R = R^,/y = 6 x 109 pc (~ 1.2 x 1015 AU), (14)
 Rq = Ra yy2 = 2.7 x 108 pc (~ 5.6 x 1013 AU). (15)

 Here R' was the constant radius of the Einstein universe, for which Lemaitre used
 the value determined by Hubble in 1926 (R' = 2.7 x 1010 pc~ 5.6 x 1015 AU)
 (Lemaitre 1927, 98).

 by Lemaitre, known as the "Friedmann-Lemaitre equations", related the time-depen-

 dent world radius to the world matter content and the cosmological constant, and were

 able to describe the evolution of the expanding universe (later on, in such equations

 R(t) was substituted by a(r), which refers to the expansion parameter, or cosmic scale

 factor). Finally, in view of the cosmic recession of galaxies from each other, empiri-

 cally confirmed by Hubble's observations, the rediscovery in 1930 of the dynamical
 models of the expanding universe formulated by Friedmann and Lemaitre inaugurated

 a new phase in the modern understanding of the universe as a whole.

 7 Conclusion

 The period ranging from the 1917 static cosmological model of Einstein to the 1930
 official entrance of the proposal of the expanding universe was characterized by a
 variety of ideas, discoveries, and controversies.

 In those years, new perspectives were opened in the far-reaching and still ongoing

 challenge to the comprehension of the universe by means of the laws of physics. The

 leading scientists dealt with several issues which emerged from the first tortuous, but

 at the same time fruitful, interplay between predictions of general relativity and astro-
 nomical observations. It is noteworthy that some topics faced in those years are still

 present in the cosmological debates. We mention, for instance, issues as the postulate
 of the homogeneity and isotropy of space, the existence of visual horizons, as well as

 the cosmological interpretation of spectral shifts, and the use of distance indicators
 for extragalactic objects.

 Certainly, the interest in the determination of the size of the universe faded away

 as the expanding universe entered modern cosmology. Nonetheless, as shown in the
 present analysis, the contributions given from 1917 to 1930 to this specific ques-
 tion can be seen as an interesting example of the efforts made to achieve a coherent

 his linear relation v = Kr, a value ranging from +465 to +530 km/s (Hubble 1929, 170-172). We refer
 to Trimble (1996) for a historical reconstruction of the determination of the Hubble constant from 1925 to
 1975.

 picture of the universe by understanding, in agreement with the legacy of Galileo, its

 mathematical language in the light of the sensible experiences.

 "The theory of today - de Sitter wrote in 1932 - is not the theory of tomorrow. (...)

 Science is developing so very rapidly nowadays, that it would be preposterous to think

 that we had reached a final state in any subject. The whole of physical science, includ-

 ing astronomy, is in a state of transition and rapid evolution. Theories are continually

 being improved and adapted to new observed facts. It would certainly not be right to

 suppose at the present time that we had reached any state of finality. We are, however,

 certainly on the right track" (de Sitter 1932a, 103-104).
