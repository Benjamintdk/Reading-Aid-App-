 Revisiting AI-Samaw'al's table of binomial coefficients:
 Greek inspiration, diagrammatic reasoning and
 mathematical induction

 Abstract In a famous passage from his al-Bàhir, al-Samaw'al proves the identity
 which we would now write as (ab)n = anbn for the cases η = 3,4. He also calculates

 the equivalent of the expansion of the binomial (a + b)n for the same values of η

 and describes the construction of what we now call the Pascal Triangle, showing the

 table up to its 12th row. We give a literal translation of the whole passage, along
 with paraphrases in more modern or symbolic form. We discuss the influence of the

 Euclidean tradition on al-Samaw'al's presentation, and the role that diagrams might

 have played in helping al-Samaw'al's readers follow his arguments, including his
 supposed use of an early form of mathematical induction.

 1 Introduction

 Al-Samaw'al ibn Yahyà al-Maghribï, born around 1130 in Baghdad, is a character of

 some repute in the history of mathematics. Composing a substantial work on math
 ematics at the prodigious age of nineteen, this son of a devout and learned Jew also

 famously and publicly converted to Islam from Judaism, maintained a long and distin

 guished career as an itinerant physician traveling throughout Iraq, Syria, Kûhistân and

 Âdharbayjân, and wrote on a proliferation of topics including medicine, mathematics,

 astronomy, religion, theories of love and erotica (Anbouba 1978).

 However, al-Samaw'al is best known for his work on mathematics: Al-Bâhirfial

 hisâb (literally: The Splendid Book on Arithmetic)1 (ca. 1150). This work is important

 to the history of mathematics for a number of reasons. Firstly, the intellectual inspira

 tion which al-Samaw' al owes to his predecessors is both substantial and acknowledged.

 Al-Samaw'al gives summaries and syntheses of a number of his predecessors in the

 Islamic tradition, including al-Khwàrizmi and al-Karajl, and turns his attention to

 mathematical ideas that had been explored by mathematicians such as Qustâ ibn Luqà,

 al-Sijzï, al-Khayyàm and Abu Kâmil (Anbouba). Furthermore, it is well established

 that Greek mathematical works provided fundamental inspiration for almost all math

 ematicians working in the Islamic tradition. Al-Samaw'al is no exception and, as we

 shall see below, his mathematical style was influenced by many of his Greek predeces

 sors, including Euclid, Heron and Diophantus, whose works clearly provided much
 motivation for both the content and articulation of his mathematical ideas.

 However, his work also contains some significant deviations from that of his Greek

 predecessors. In particular, al-Samaw'al epitomizes a conflation of the geometric and

 arithmetic approaches that had been developing in the works of many of his Islamic

 predecessors as they assimilated, synthesized and then built on the approaches of their

 Greek precursors. Notably, in various places in the Al-Bâhir, we can discern some

 decisive breaks from Greek contexts, including advancing an increasingly abstract

 articulation of number, algebraic styles of reasoning and a new significance for dia

 grams. One result of these developments is that some features retained from the Greek

 geometric styles of reasoning become redundant, superfluous or even unhelpful.

 Al-Bâhir is a substantial work. Our study focuses on a small but significant part of

 it—the opening passage from fourth chapter of the second section. This passage has

 already attracted attention (Berggren 2003, 2007; Rashed 1972) because of its descrip

 tion and rendering of a table of binomial coefficients, and because of its apparent use of

 a mathematical mode of reasoning more frequently known today as mathematical (or

 complete) induction. The table of coefficients, of course, is better known as the Pascal

 Triangle, appearing in French mathematician Blaise Pascal's work Traité du triangle

 arithmétique (published posthumously in 1665), but it has many attested antecedents

 including from India, China, and Italy (Edwards 2002). The apparent use of induction

 has seen al-Samaw'al's insights compared to similar achievements by mathematicians
 in other cultures and times such as Pascal, Levi Ben Gerson, Maurolico, and Simon

 Stevin, among others (Rashed 1972).

 The passage in question begins with five propositions in rhetorical algebra which

 set out rules for expanding expressions equivalent to (ab)n and (a + b)n for the cases

 η = 3,4, followed by assertions about such expansions for higher powers. It concludes

 with a description of the construction of the table of binomial coefficients and gives

 the table up to its twelfth row.

 We present here for the first time a literal English translation and detailed math

 ematical commentary of this passage. Then, using direct evidence from this careful

 textual scrutiny, we explore two issues raised by al-Samaw'al's exposition. Firstly, we

 consider the influence of the Greek geometric and arithmetic heritage on al-Samaw'al

 1 Although some authors have chosen the title Al-Bàhir fi al-jabr, the evidence of the two manuscripts we

 used supports our reading.

 and the ways in which Al-Bâhir represents the transition between this source of inspi

 ration and the new nascent modes of mathematical reckoning and practice. Secondly,

 we examine the diversity and role of al-Samaw'al's diagrams in his exposition and the

 ways in which they might have supported his mathematical arguments.

 In addition, we will revisit the question of how this text is to be understood in

 the historical development of mathematical induction. We will offer fresh insight into

 recent scholarly discussion on this issue (see Acerbi 2000; Fowler 1994; Rabinovitch
 1970; Rashed 1972; Unguru 1991, 1994) using al-Samaw'al's exposition to advance
 new perspectives on the strands of activity that may usefully be considered to fall

 under the purview of this mode of mathematical reasoning.

 2 Text and translation

 2.1 Notes on the translation

 This translation is based on the relevant excerpt from an edition of Al-Bâhir (Ahmad

 and Rashed 1972, pp. 104-112) which was prepared by Ahmad and Rashed on the

 basis of two manuscripts. The first manuscript, numbered 2718 of Aya Sofia (116ff),

 was copied in 1324. The second is numbered 3155 Esat Efendi (88ff). Both are housed

 in the Suleymaniye library (Istanbul, Turkey).2 This is the first time this section of

 Al-Bâhir has been translated as a whole into English, and the first time the diagrams

 in this section of Aya Sofia 2718 have been published and studied.3

 For flow and clarity, we have arranged our translation and mathematical com

 mentary proposition by proposition, and the numbered subheadings we have used to

 delimit the presentation are ours (not al-Samaw'al's) and are intended for the reader's

 convenience; the original text is continuous.

 For each proposition, we have presented our mathematical analysis in two distinct

 parts. This dual approach is based on 'paraphrasing' the mathematical content. The

 2 There seems to be some confusion with respect to the numbering and location of these manuscripts.
 Ahmad and Rashed (1972, pp. 1-2) claim the Aya Sofia manuscript to be no. 2118, but in the collection in

 Cairo (sic!), and the other manuscript, no. 3155 Esat ef., to be in the Suleymaniye library. Anbouba (1978)
 states the Aya Sofia manuscript to be no. 2718 and 115ff and in Istanbul. King (1976) declares that both

 manuscripts are in Istanbul and were discovered by Krause (1936) and that in 1961 Anbouba summarized

 the work and further emphasized its importance to the scholarly community (Anbouba 1961). It may be
 relevant to note that only Anbouba's contribution is cited by Ahmed and Rashed, who furthermore claim

 responsibility for having revealed to the Suleymaniye library that ms. 3155 Esat Ef., previously classified

 as 'anonymous,' was a copy of al-Samaw'al's Al-Bâhir (Ahmad and Rashed 1972, p. 2).

 3 It is true that Rashed discusses this whole passage in Rashed (1972, pp. 3-8,1994, pp. 63-68) as part of his

 investigation into al-Karajï's and al-Samaw'al's role in the history of mathematical induction (al-Samaw'al

 explicitly credits large portions of the contents of this passage to his predecessor al-Karajï (953-ca. 1029) and

 at some points his terminology seems to suggest he may even be directly quoting him). Indeed, Rashed gives

 full translations for propositions 1, 2 and 4 (admittedly with unacknowledged corrections to his edition)

 and for the construction of the binomial table. However, he gives only a modern symbolic paraphrase for

 proposition 3 and he omits completely the proof of proposition 5. He also omits all the diagrams and changes

 the order of the propositions. Berggren (2007, pp. 552-554) has translated the portion of this passage which

 gives the construction of the binomial triangle. A version of the diagrams from Aya Sofia 2718 was published

 in Ahmad and Rashed (1972), but these omitted the red line segments visible in the diagrams accompanying

 propositions 1,2 and 4, leaving instead a selection of the black dots marking the end points of the lines.

 first paraphrase attempts to simplify the rhetorical presentation while staying as close

 as possible to the original processes of exposition and reasoning (albeit using modern

 notation). The second (where appropriate) is an explanation of the same proposition

 but using modern operations and procedures and modern symbolic algebra. For exam

 ple, the first paraphrase might retain the Euclidean language of ratios and operations

 on them, while the second interprets these in terms of fractions. Or, again, the first

 paraphrase might retain the original's sequential symbolic names for quantities (such

 as a, b, c and so on), while the second takes advantage of algebraic symbolism to

 identify products as ab (instead of c, say) or powers as a3 (instead of e, say). Thus,

 the first paraphrase is designed to keep intact the original expressions and operations

 that al-Samaw'al uses, while the second, more modern paraphrase, is for ease of com

 prehension for those more familiar with modern mathematical procedures.

 In translating this passage, we have attempted to be as literal as possible to convey

 the fullest impression of the original text for non-Arabic readers and also to give a

 sense of the distinct modes of expression original to this mathematical context. How

 ever, on occasion there was need to suggest minor modifications to the text when the

 mathematical context demanded it, or for the mathematical integrity and consistency

 of the work. These have been clearly identified and noted. Emendations to the text

 (as presented in the edition Ahmad and Rashed 1972) have been indicated by the use

 of square brackets [· · · ] in the English translation. When English sense requires the

 addition of words for fluency, or for glosses and supplementary material, we have

 indicated the additions by round brackets: (···). Notes or comments which have been

 deemed crucial for intelligibility have been indicated in footnotes.

 2.1.1 Letters as labels

 Al-Samaw'al often uses Arabic letters to label the line segments (or their extremities)

 that he invokes in the course of his demonstrations. In Aya Sofia 2718, these letters are

 usually written with an over-bar to visually demarcate them in the text. We have used

 lower case italics to transliterate the line segments, and upper case italics when the

 letters indicate the extremities of line segments in order to avoid confusion. The order
 in which he invokes these letters shows a clear Greek influence, in the tradition of

 Euclid and his practice of lettering his diagrams, with features of the diagram labeled

 in standard order as they arise during the demonstration (Netz 1999, p. 71). Indeed,

 the Arabic letters which al-Samaw'al uses do not reflect the Arabic lexical ordering of

 them, but rather the ancient Greek lexical ordering of first a, then β, then γ, then 8, and

 so forth. Where exact transliterations to the Greek did not exist, the closest Arabic letter

 was substituted. Since this standard ordering of labels seems to contribute the flow

 of his diagrams (see Sect. 3.2), we have deviated from the traditional correspondence

 between Arabic and Latin letters (Kennedy 1991-1992) and have tried to retain this

 flow by using the equivalent English letters as they appear in English alphabetical

 order, as shown in Table 1,4 We argue that the order in which the letters were placed

 4 Heath used a similar strategy when translating Euclid's Elements. Compare the diagrams in Ref. "Euclid"
 (1883-1916) and Heath (1956).

 This preserves the alphabetic ordering of the labels

 read.

 2.2 Translation and mathematical commentary

 2.2.1 Al-Samaw'al's title and opening statement

 Chapter 4 from section 2 on the geometrical demonstrations used to extract unknown

 numbers. There are two methods. The first method from chapter 4 section 2 consists
 of the arithmetical foundations.

 2.2.2 Mathematical commentary

 The aim of this part ofAl-Bâhir is to offer mathematicians various techniques that might

 help them to solve equations (Ahmad and Rashed 1972, pp. 53-64). For example, al

 Samaw'al himself later used the propositions and binomial table, that we study in this

 paper, to develop methods for extracting nth roots (Rashed 1978). The arithmetical

 methods mentioned here are being contrasted with geometrical methods, although as

 we shall see these approaches are mingled together in the demonstrations. Our extract

 marks the beginning of a series of propositions about numbers which are proved using
 techniques similar to those in the arithmetical books in Euclid's Elements. The shorter

 second part of Chapter 4 uses techniques similar to those in the geometrical books of

 the Elements (Ahmad and Rashed 1972, pp. 64-66).

 2.2.3 Al-Samaw'al's proposition one

 (For) any four numbers, the product of the surface5 of the first and the second by the

 surface of the third and the fourth is equal to the product of the surface of the first and

 the third by the surface of the second and the fourth.

 5 ΑΙ-Samaw'al has two ways to refer to the product of two numbers. He can use the Arabie Word 'سطح'

 0musattah) whieh literally means 'surface,' or he can use the Word 'ضرب' (darb) which means 'product.'

 In order to capture the différence, we preserve his choice even though the mathematical meaning is the

 sarae. The conesponding adjective in Euclid (VII, définition 16) is usually translated as 'plane' (as in 'plane

 numbers,' the resuit of multiplying two numbers together), but it is sometimes rendered as 'representing
 a surface.' H0yrup (2002) uses 'surface' to capture a similarly distinct notion of product in Babylonian
 mathematics.

 Let us consider four numbers a, b, c, d, and let us multiply a by b to get e, and let us
 multiply a by c to get [/, and let us multiply b by d to get]6 g. Let us multiply c by d

 to get h (see the manuscript diagram in Fig. 1).

 Then, I say that the product of e and h is equal to the product of / and g.

 Its demonstration: When the number a is multiplied (respectively) by the two numbers

 b and c, then there results from the multiplication the two numbers e and /. Then, the
 ratio of e to / is the same as the ratio of b to c.

 Moreover, when the number d is multiplied (respectively) by the two numbers b and

 c, then there results from the multiplication the two numbers g and h. Then, the ratio

 We know that the ratio of e to / is the same as the ratio of b to c. Then, the ratio of e

 of g to h is the same as the ratio of b to c.

 to / is the same as the ratio of g to h.

 Then, the surface of e and h is equal to the surface of / and g and this is what we
 wished to demonstrate.

 2.2.4 Mathematical commentary

 In symbolic terms, al-Samaw'al proves that (ab)(cd) = (ac)(bd). It is tempting
 to think this proposition is obvious ('why not simply remove the brackets and use
 be = cbT) and to ask why he sees a need to prove it. To some extent, this puzzle is
 an artifact of viewing his rhetorical algebra in symbolic terms. Indeed, by the time
 al-Samaw'al has named all the numbers he will need in the proof, the initial numbers
 a, b, c, d have lost their identity in the proposed identity eh = fg. But it is also
 not clear what his criteria were for a proposition to need a proof. For example, in the

 course of proving proposition 3, he feels a need to refer to Elements 11,1 to justify
 the rhetorical equivalent of (a + b)x = xa + xb but he is happy to state without

 6 Ahmad and Rashed (1972, p. 105) fix this omission by changing a letter written by the scribe and inserting

 a missing phrase. Our emendation is slightly simpler, involving only a missing phrase at the start of a new
 line in the manuscript and no corrections of written letters.

 proof7 the fact that we would now write as (pq)r = (pr)q. Similarly, in proposition 4

 he states without proof various facts like the rhetorical equivalent of (3a2b)a = 3a3b.
 In any case, having decided that proposition 1 needed a proof, he uses the same

 techniques involving ratios that we see in Elements VII, 19 where Euclid proves that if

 four numbers are in proportion then the product of the first and the fourth is the same

 as the product of the second and the third.

 First paraphrase: using modern symbols, but retaining his use of ratios. To help

 the reader, each step of the argument is on a separate line. Al-Samaw'al's diagram,

 translated in Fig. 2, may also help, as we shall see in Sect. 3.2, where we explore the

 meaning of such diagrams and how al-Samaw'al and his readers might have used them

 to help understand his proofs.

 Let a, b, c, d be four numbers.

 Let ab = e and ac — /, and let cd = h and bd = g.

 Then I say that eg — fh.

 Demonstration Multiplying a by b and c gives e and /, respectively.

 Hence8 the ratio e : f is the same as the ratio b : c.

 Moreover, multiplying d by b and c gives g and h respectively. Hence, the ratio g : h
 is the same as the ratio b : c.

 Thus9, the ratio e : f is the same as the ratio g : h.
 Hence10 eh = fg which is what we wished to demonstrate.

 Second paraphrase: using symbolic algebra and replacing ratios by fractions.

 I say that (ab)(cd) = (ac){bd).

 Demonstration Since

 we have

 ab b bd

 ac c cd

 (ab)(cd) = (ac)(bd).

 discrete numbers and continuous magnitudes (Oaks 2011); thus, we cite both the geometric and arithmetic
 context from Euclid's work.

 2.2.5 Al-Samaw'al's proposition two

 The surface of two sides each cubed is equal [to the cube]11 of their surface.
 Let the cubic numbers be the two numbers a and b, and let their sides be c and d, and

 let their squares be e and /, and let c be multiplied by d to get the number g, and let

 a be multiplied by b to get h (see the manuscript diagram in Fig. 3).

 Then, I say that the number h is equal to the cube of the number g.

 Its demonstration: Indeed, it was explained in the arithmetical sections that if the
 square number e is multiplied by the square number / there results from this multi
 plication the square of the number g, the surface.

 Then, if the result from this is multiplied by the surface of c and d, I mean by the

 number g, there results from this the cube of the number g, and it is the product of the

 surface of e and / and the surface of c and d.

 But the result from the product of the surface of e and / and the surface of c and

 d is equal to the result from the product of the surface c and e and the surface [of /
 and]12 d, as we explained in the previous proposition.

 Therefore, the result from the product of the surface of e and c and the surface of
 d and / is equal to the cube of the number g. But, the result from the product c and e

 [is the number a] and the surface of d and / is the number b.

 Therefore, the surface of a and b, I mean the number h is equal to the cube of

 number g, and this is what we wished to demonstrate.

 2.2.6 Mathematical commentary

 In symbolic terms al-Samaw'al proves that (cd)3 = c3d3.

 First paraphrase: using modern symbols, but staying close to his style of reasoning.

 We add this for mathematical sense. Ahmad and Rashed (1972, p. 105) leave this phrase as it is, noting

 ι ι ι

 simply (and erroneously) in a footnote that the proposition says that (ab) 3 = a 3 b 3.

 12 This is originally inserted by Ahmad and Rashed (1972, p. 105).

 But c2c = c3 and d2d = d3.

 Thus c3d3 = (cd)3 which is what we wanted.

 Notice that this last version of the proof makes it much easier for one who knows

 about the technique to see how one might use induction to prove that cndn = (cd)".

 2.2.7 Al-Samaw'al's proposition three

 (When) any number is divided into two parts, then its cube is equal to (the sum of) the

 cubes of its two parts and the product of each of its parts by the square of the other

 part taken three times.

 Its example: If a number A Β is divided at the point C (see the manuscript diagram in

 Fig. 5), then I say that the cube of A Β is equal to the cube of AC and the cube of CB

 and the product of AC by the square of CB taken three times and the product of CB

 by the square of AC taken three times.

 Its demonstration: Indeed, the square of AB is equal to the square of AC and the
 square of CB and the product of AC by C Β taken twice.

 Fig. 5 Diagram accompanying proposition 3 in Aya Sofya 2718

 If we multiply A Β by its square, we obtain its cube. So the cube of A Β is equal to the

 product of Α β by the square of AC, the square of CΒ and the product of AC by Cβ
 taken twice.

 The product of Α β and any number is equivalent to the product of AC and CB by
 this number, as Euclid explained in the first proposition of Book 2.

 So the product of the square of AC by AC and by CB, and the product of the square
 of CΒ by CΒ and by AC, and the product of double the surface encompassed by AC
 and CB by AC, and the product of this also by CB, is equivalent to the cube of AB.
 (So) the product of the square of AC and AC, that is the cube of AC, and the product
 of the square of AC by Cβ [and the product of the square of CB and CB, that is the

 cube of CB],13 and the product of the square of CB by AC and the product of double
 the surface that is encompassed by AC and CB by each one of AC and CB [is the
 cube of AB].14

 But, for any surface, if we multiply the surface by one of its sides, then the result

 from this product is equal to that which arises from the product of the square of that

 side by the other side, since for any three numbers, the product of the first by the

 second and then by the third is equal to the product of the first by the third then by the
 second.

 Thus, the existing cube15 of AB is equal to the cube of AC and the cube of CB and
 the product of AC by the square of C Β taken three times and the product of CB by
 the square of AC taken three times, and this is what we wished to demonstrate.

 2.2.8 Mathematical commentary

 Al-Samaw'al's AB notation and the reference to Euclid (Elements 11,1) both suggest

 geometric thinking. His simple diagram in Fig. 6 is the same diagram that Heron uses in

 his proofs 'without a diagram' for the propositions in Elements II. It is possible that al

 13 There is clearly a problem with this section of the text. We propose to emend it as we have indicated
 in accordance with mathematical sense. This problem is not mentioned in the édition (Ahmad and Rashed
 1972), but is implicitly corrected in Rashed's symbolic paraphrases in Rashed (1972, p. 4) and (1994, pp.
 64 65). See also the next footnote.

 14 This scribe appears to have omitted some terms here as well. We have corrected the text in line with the
 corresponding step from proposition 4, adding a missing term, the cube of CB, as well as a reminder that
 the whole sum cornes to the cube of AB.

 Samaw'al would have been familiar with these proofs from al-Nayrizi's commentary

 on Euclid's Elements (Lo Bello 2009, p. 26).16

 We offer a single paraphrase this time, replacing al-Samaw'al's line segments by

 algebraic symbols and using symbolic algebra. To stay close to his notation, we have

 replaced the lines AC, CB and AB by a, b and a + b, respectively.17

 Paraphrase: I say that (a + &)3 = a3 + &3 + 3(ab2 + ba2).
 Demonstration We already know that

 (a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2 ab.

 Multiplying by a + b we get

 (a + bΫ = (a + b)(a2 + b2 + 2 ab).

 For any number χ we have (a + b)x = ax + bx, as Euclid explains in Elements (11,1).
 So we get

 But (xy)x — x2y since for any three numbers p, q, r we have {pq)r — (pr)q. Thus

 (a + bf =a3 + b* + 3ab2 + 3 ba2

 which is what we wished to demonstrate.

 2.2.9 Al-Samaw'al's proposition four

 (When) any number is divided into two parts, then the square square of the divided

 number is equal to the square square of each one of the two parts and the product of

 16 The point of Heron's proofs seems not to be to dispense with geometric thinking itself, since the diagram

 is still clearly geometric. Rather, it seems that Heron wishes to transfer the bulk of the calculation to the

 reader's imagination, leavingjust a divided line to record to essential relationships. This suits al-Samaw'al's

 purposes particularly well here, since he conjures up calculations beyond the reach of plane geometry,

 involving third and fourth powers.

 17 An intermediate paraphrase, in the style of our other first paraphrases, may be obtained by reversing
 these substitutions. Thus, the statement would become ab3 = ac3 + cb3 + 3(ac.cb2 + cb.ac2) and so on.

 each one of the two parts by the cube of the other part taken four times and the product

 of the square of one of them by the square of the other taken six times (Fig. 7).
 Its example: When a number AB is divided into two parts, and they are AC and CB
 (see the manuscript diagram in Fig. 7), then the square square of A Β is equal to the
 square square of AC and the square square of CB and the product of AC by the cube
 of CB taken four times, and the product of CΒ by the cube of AC taken four times,

 and the product of the square of AC and the square of CB taken six times.

 Its demonstration: Indeed, the square square18 of Α β is the product of A Β by its
 cube, and we explained in the previous proposition that the cube of Λ β is equal to
 the cube of AC and the cube of CB and the product of AC by the square of CB
 taken three times and the product of CΒ by the square of AC taken three times. The
 product of A Β by any number is equal to the product of that number by AC and by
 CB, therefore, the product of the cube of AC by AC, which is the square square of
 A C, and by CB, and the product of the cube of C Β by C Β, which is the square square

 of CB, and by AC, [and the product of the surface of the square of AC by C Β taken
 three times by AC and by CB]19 and the product of the surface of the square of CB
 by AC taken three times by AC and by CB, is the square square of AB.
 But, three times the product of the surface of the square of AC by CB by AC [is

 equal to] three times the product of the cube of AC by Cβ. Similarly, three times the
 surface of the product of the square of AC by C β by Ci? [is equal to] three times the

 product of the square of AC by the square of CB. Similarly, three times the product
 of the surface of the square of Cβ by AC by AC is equal to three times the product
 of the square of AC by the square of CB. And three times the product of the surface
 of the square of C5 by AC by Cβ is equal to three times the product of the cube of
 Cfi by AC.

 Therefore, the square square of Α β is equal to the square square of AC and the
 square square of CB, and the product of AC by the cube of CB taken four times, and

 the product of C Β by the cube of AC taken four times, and the product of the square

 of AC by the square of CB taken six times, and this is what we wished to demonstrate.

 18 At this point in the proposition, al-Samaw'al switches to calling the fourth power by the 'arithmetical'

 term نال تال (mal mal), instead of the 'geometrical' term مرح ربع (square square) used in the statement
 of the proposition, even though he retains the term for square for the second power.

 19 For mathematical sense, we have inserted a term. Due to the fact that this phrase is almost identical to
 the last, it seems plausible there has been some omission due to scribal oversight.

 2.2.10 Mathematical commentary

 In this proposition, al-Samaw'al has retained the geometric notation used in proposi

 tion 3. Thus, he repeats his diagram from the previous proposition (Fig. 6) and A Β once

 again seems to signify a line segment. On the other hand, it is possible that his switch

 part-way through the proof to the 'arithmetical' term mal mal for the fourth power

 is an acknowledgement that square squares are hardly geometric. Our paraphrase in

 terms of symbolic algebra uses the same conventions as in that proposition.

 Paraphrase: I say that (a + b)4 = a4 + b4 + 4a b3 + 4ba3 + 6a2b2.
 Demonstration We know that

 (a + b)A = {a + b)(a + b)3

 and we saw in proposition 3 that

 (a + b)3 = a3 + b3 + 3 ab2 + 3 ba2

 and we know that for any number χ we have (a + b)x = xa + xb. Therefore

 a3 a + a3b + b3b + b3a + [(3 a2b)a + (3 a2b)b) + (3 b2a)a + (3b2a)b = (a + b)4

 where a3a = a4 and b3b = b4.

 But (3a2b)a = 3a3b. Similarly (3a2b)b = 3a2b2. Similarly (3b2a)a = 3a2b2 and
 (3b2a)b = ?>b3a. Thus

 (α + b)4 = a4 + b4 + 4 ab3 + Aba3 + 6 a2b2

 which is what we wished to demonstrate.

 2.2.11 Al-Samaw'al's proposition five

 The mal mal of the surface of any two numbers is equal to the surface of the mal mal
 of each of them.

 Let the numbers be the two numbers a and b and their surface be the number c. Then,

 I say that the mal mal of c is equal to the product of the mal mal of a by the mal mal
 of b.

 Its demonstration: a is multiplied by itself to get d and a is multiplied by d to get e

 and e is multiplied by a to get /, then / is mal mal of a.

 Let b be multiplied by itself to get g and let g be multiplied by b to get h and h be

 multiplied by b to get i, then i is mal mal of b.

 c is multiplied by itself to get j and j is multiplied by c to get k and multiply k by c

 to get /, then I is mal mal of c (see the manuscript diagram in Fig. 8).

 Then, I say that I is equal to the surface of / and i.

 Fig. 8 Marginal diagram accompanying proposition 5 in Aya Sofya 2718 (rotated 90° clockwise). The
 last row of line segments is labeled by a repeated Arabic word-perhaps qadr meaning magnitude—whose
 significance is unclear to us

 Therefore, because the two sides of c are the two numbers a and b, and the two sides

 of j are the two numbers d and g, the squares, we obtain that the ratio of the surface

 c to the surface j is compounded20 of the ratio of α to ci and the ratio of b to g.
 But the ratio of a to d is equivalent to the ratio of d to e because the two numbers a
 and d multiplied by a produce d and e.

 And the ratio of b to g is equivalent to the ratio of g to h because the two numbers

 b and g multiplied by the number b produce g and h.

 [And the ratio of c to j is equivalent to the ratio of j to k because the two numbers c
 and j multiplied by the number c produce j and A:].21

 Therefore, the ratio of [j to k]22 is compounded of the ratio of d to e and the ratio of

 g to h.

 But j is the surface of d and g, so k is the surface of e and h.
 This is evident from the converse of proposition 5 from Book VIII of The Elements,23

 But, the ratio of d to e is equivalent to the ratio of e to / and the ratio of g to h is

 equivalent to the ratio of h toi.

 And the ratio of j to k is equivalent to the ratio of k to /.

 Therefore, the ratio of k to / is compounded of the ratio of e to / and the ratio of h
 to i.

 But when e is multiplied by h we get k, so when / is multiplied by i we get I, and this
 is what we wished to demonstrate.

 2.2.12 Mathematical commentary

 First paraphrase: using modern symbols, but retaining his argument in terms of ratios.

 Once again, referring to his diagram (Fig. 9) may help, as we shall see in Sect. 3.2.

 Let the two numbers be a and b, and let their product be c.

 Then I say that c4 = a4b4.

 But the ratio a : d is equal to the ratio d : e since a and d multiplied by a give d and

 And the ratio b : g is equal to the ratio g : h since b and g multiplied by b give g and
 h.

 [And, the ratio c : j is equal to the ratio j : k since c and j multiplied by c give j and
 k]

 Therefore, the ratio [;' : k] is the ratio compounded of the ratios d : e and g : h.

 But j — dg so k = eh, by the converse to Elements VIII,5.24

 But the ratio d : e equals the ratio e : f,

 and the ratio g : h equals the ratio h : i,

 and the ratio j : k equals the ratio k : I.

 Hence, the ratio k : I is the ratio compounded of the ratios e : f and h : i.
 But k — eh so we get I = fi, which is what we wished to demonstrate.

 Second paraphrase: using symbolic algebra and replacing ratios by fractions.

 Since (ab)2 = a2b2, we know that

 But

 24 In this context, Elements VIII,5 says that if j = dg and k = eh then the ratio j : k is the ratio
 compounded of the ratios d : e and g : h. The converse needed here would say that, if the ratio j : k is
 the ratio compounded of the ratios d : e and g : h and if j = dg, then k = eh. This converse is not in the
 Elements.

 2.2.13 Al-Samaw'al's on cases η = 5 and higher

 By the same method, it can be demonstrated that the mal cube of the surface of any

 two numbers is equal to the surface of the mal cube of one of them by the mal cube

 of the other, and so on in increasing order.

 For a person who understands what we have done then that person can demonstrate

 that for any number divided into two parts the mal cube is equal to the mal cube of

 each of the two parts and the product of each one by the mal mal of the other one taken

 5 times and (the product of) the square of each of them by the cube of the other taken

 10 times, and so on for the next ascending terms.

 2.2.14 Mathematical commentary

 In symbolical terms, al-Samaw'al says that the same method (as in proposition 2 or

 5, presumably) can be used to show that

 (ab)5 = a5b5.

 Although it is not explicit, he also seems to claim that this same method will show the

 general result (ab)n = anbn for η — 6, 7

 Similarly, he says that anyone who has understood proposition 3 or 4 will also be

 able to show that

 (a + b)5 = a5 + b5 + 5 (ab4 + baA) + 10(α V + b2a3)

 as well as the corresponding results for higher powers. At this stage, it is not clear

 what those corresponding results are, but al-Samaw'al will tell us how to find out in

 the following paragraphs.

 2.2.15 Al-Samaw'al's on how to construct the table

 Let us now indicate a principle25 for knowing the number of times that are necessary

 to multiply these powers26 by each other for any number divided into two parts.

 Al-Karajï says: in order to achieve that, you place on a board27 one and one below it
 (see the manuscript diagram in Fig. 10).
 Then, move the (first) one into another column and add the (first) one to the one (that

 was) below it, then there is two. Place it under it (the first one). Then, you place the
 last one below it.

 Then, there results one and two and one.

 This shows you that for any number combined from two numbers, if you multiply
 each of them by itself once, since the two ends are one and one, and if you multiply
 one of them by the other twice, since the middle term is two, there results the square
 of that number.

 Then, we move the one from the second column to another column, and we add the
 one to the two. There results three and we write it under the one. We add the two to

 25 The Arabie Word used here is اصلأ

 26 The Arabie Word invoked here (,martaba pl. maratib) means literally rank, grade, step, degree or levels,
 so it is likely that there is a reference at least to the ordering we now represent by powers of an algebraic
 symbol. See for instance Souissi (1969, p. 39-41) or Woepcke (1851, p. 6).

 27 This no doubt refers to the Arabie équivalent of a slate, a standard device for doing computations.

 the one below it, then we obtain three. We write it below the three. [Then, we place
 the last one below it].

 There results from this the third column, which is, individually: one and three and

 three and one.

 This teaches you that the cube of any number combined from two numbers is the

 cube of each of them and the product of each of them by the square of the other taken
 three times.

 Then, we move the one from the third column to another column. Then, we add the

 one to the three below it. There will be four. You write it below the one. Then, you
 add three to the three below it. There will be six. You write it below the four. You add

 the second three to the one. There will be four. You write it below the six. Then, you
 move the one to under the four.

 Then, there results from this another column, which is, individually: one and four

 and six and four and one.

 This teaches you that the construction of mal mal from a number combined from

 two numbers is when you make the mal mal of each of them, because of the one at the

 two ends, then you multiply each number by the cube of the other taken four times,

 since the four follows as you come in from the two ends which are one and one, since

 the root by the cube will be mal mal, then, you multiply the square of one of them by

 the square of the other taken six times, since the six is the middle, and since the square

 by the square is mal mal.

 Then, you move the one from the fourth column into the fifth column. Then, you

 add the one to the four below it, and the four to six below it, the six to the four below

 it, and the four to the one below it. Then, you write down the results of that below the

 one that was moved into the aforementioned adjacent (column) and you write after
 this the remaining one.

 We obtain from this the fifth column, its numbers: 1 and 5 and 10 and 10 and 5 and

 1.

 This teaches you that for any number divided into two parts, its mal cube is equal to

 the mal cube of each part, since the two ends are one and one, and the product of each

 of them by the mal mal of the other taken 5 times, since fives are next as you come

 in from the two end ones, and the product of the square of each one by the cube of
 the other taken 10 times, since the numbers 10 are next after the two fives. Each one

 from this group belongs to the type mal cube as the root by mal mal and the cube by

 mal both give mal cube. By this procedure, one knows the number of times for mal

 ing and cubing according to what result we want and here is its diagram (Table 2).

 3.1 Heritage versus development

 This excerpt from Al-Bâhir is steeped in the tradition of classical Greek mathemat
 ics. This can be seen in its mode of exposition, its reliance on Euclidean results,

 its geometrical orientation, and the phrasing and grammatical conventions it often
 exhibits. But in many respects, it is also emblematic of the ways in which Islamic

 scholars were extending their results beyond this setting and propelling mathematics

 in entirely new directions. In this way, the work can be considered as epitomizing

 the transitional nature of mathematics during this period, in particular the blending

 of the domains of arithmetic and geometry. Indeed, given these new ambitions for

 mathematics, many of the imports from the original Greek setting become somewhat

 less useful or even incompatible, particularly those terms which have explicit geomet

 rical meaning. Indeed, in al-Samaw'al's account, we can directly appreciate how the

 blending and synthesis of these concepts in new and unprecedented ways has given

 rise to novel mathematical insights, such as his table of binomial coefficients. In this
 section, we shall look at, on the one hand, al-Samaw'al's strict adherence to Euclidean

 conventions for demonstrations, and on the other hand, his insightful use of algebraic

 terms applied to geometry and arithmetic.

 3.1.1 Heritage: the art of deduction

 The influence of Greek geometrical practice is appreciable both explicitly and implic

 itly. Al-Samaw'al explicitly refers to Euclid's Elements only once in this extract (the
 reference to proposition 1 of Book II, during the demonstration of proposition 3)

 although it is used again without direct reference during the demonstration of his

 proposition 4.28 However, al-Samaw'al's mode of expression harks back to Euclidean

 writing,29 with each of his propositions following a structure similar to that which

 Proclus observed in his commentary on Book I of the Elements.30 Thus, if we follow

 28 One other reference occurs during the demonstration of al-Samaw'al's proposition 5, where he mentions

 the converse of proposition 5 from Book VIII, a converse not mentioned by Euclid.

 29 This is typical of Islamic authors. For other examples which have been analyzed in similar ways, see,
 for instance, Oaks (2011) and the study of Abu Kâmil.

 30 We follow Heath's translation in Heath (1956, pp. 129-130). Netz gives an example of Proclus' divisions
 applied to a Euclidean proposition in Netz (1999, pp. 9-11).

 S. Bajri et al.

 proposition 1 as a typical example, al-Samaw'al's propositions begin with a statement

 of the general result in rhetorical form:

 (For) any four numbers, the product of the surface of the first and the second by

 the surface of the third and the fourth is equal to the product of the surface of

 the first and the third by the surface of the second and the fourth.

 This corresponds to Proclus' enunciation, which is supposed to state what is given and

 what is sought, but which also (as Heath observes) does this in quite general terms.

 Next al-Samaw'al makes this general statement more concrete (this is Proclus' setting

 out) by assigning names to any quantities mentioned:

 Let us consider four numbers a, b, c, d, and let us multiply α by b to get e, and let

 us multiply a by c to get [/, and let us multiply b by d to get] g. Let us multiply

 c by d to get h.

 As in the Elements, the names can be either single letters (as in propositions 1, 2

 and 5) or paired letters representing a line segment (as in propositions 3 and 4). In

 propositions 3 and 4 al-Samaw'al labels this step Its example?1 but there is no such

 indication in propositions 1,2 and 5. Following this naming of quantities, al-Samaw'al

 then restates the claim of the proposition in terms of these named quantities, often

 opening with a characteristic phrase echoing Euclid's own usage, the use of the first

 person singular statement (our italics):

 Then I say that the product of e and g is equal to the product of / and h.

 This corresponds to Proclus' definition or specification and Heath sees these last

 two steps as a way of better focusing the reader's attention (Heath 1956, p. 130).

 However, Netz (1999, Chapter 6) sees these first three steps as a way of stating a

 general result of potentially infinite scope (the enunciation) before reducing the task

 to proving a specific typical case (the setting out and its consequential definition).

 Al-Samaw'al usually labels the next section as Its demonstration}2 Here, typically,

 a chain of reasoning is built (Proclus' demonstration or proof33) culminating in a

 restatement of the original claim (Proclus' conclusion).

 Its demonstration: When the number a is multiplied (respectively) by the two

 numbers b and c, then there results from the multiplication the two numbers e

 and /. Then, the ratio of e to / is the same as the ratio of b to c. Moreover, when

 the number d is multiplied (respectively) by the two numbers b and c, then there

 results from the multiplication the two numbers h and g. Then, the ratio of h to

 g is the same as the ratio of b to c. We know that the ratio of e to / is the same

 31 Proclus' word to describe this stage is ekthesis. In Arabic, al-Samaw'al marks it using the word: mithâl

 (a noun that means 'example' or 'instantiation').

 32 Proclus' word to describe this section is apodeixis. In Arabic, al-Samaw'al marks it using the word

 burhan (a noun meaning demonstration, proof) from the verb barhana, to prove, demonstrate.

 Montelle (2012, p. 27ff).

 as the ratio of b to c. Then, the ratio of e to / is the same as the ratio of h to g.

 Then, the surface34 of e and g is equal to the surface of / and h.

 Often the logical steps rely on propositions from Euclid's Elements but, following

 Euclid's own custom, this reliance is not usually explicit.35 The completion of the

 demonstration is then announced in a phrase echoing Euclid's what it was required to
 demonstrate,36

 So al-Samaw'al is in many ways emblematic of the indebtedness of the Arabic

 scholars to the Greek tradition of exposition and demonstration. There is no doubt

 that he and his predecessors were well versed in the deductive style of mathematics

 of Euclid from reading Arabic versions of the Elements.

 3.1.2 Developments for algebraic powers applied to arithmetic and geometry

 On the other hand, al-Samaw'al's treatment of algebraic products and powers is part

 of a story of continual revision and development, with his Arabic predecessors trans

 forming and building on ideas inherited from Euclid and Diophantus.

 Arabic mathematicians developed a notion of number in various ways from Greek

 conceptions, sometimes conflating the domains of geometry and arithmetic in both

 nuanced and direct manners. For instance, al-Khwârizmï (b. ca. 780) used what H0yrup

 (2002, p. 412) would call naive, or cut-and-paste, geometrical demonstrations to val

 idate his algebraic procedures (Oaks 2011). Later, Thâbit ibn Qurra (b. 836) would

 use Euclidean geometry to justify al-Khwârizmï's algebraic rules (H0yrup 2002, p.

 412). On the other hand, Abu Kâmil (b. ca. 850) used both geometrical and arithmetical

 'proofs' alongside one another (Oaks 2011). Typically, this dual approach offered geo

 metrical demonstrations, in the style of al-Khwârizmï, for specific calculations (such

 as V9 · V4 = V9 · 4) but gave arithmetical demonstrations, in the style of Euclid's

 material on number theory, for general results (such as Ja ■ *Jb = -Ja ■ b). Later

 still, al-Khayyâm (b. 1048) was dedicated to the notion that number could only be a
 positive integer, and held firm to the Aristotelian conviction that quantity was either

 discrete or continuous. Consequently, for him, because algebra allowed both frac

 tions and irrational roots, it belonged in toto to the domain of geometry (Oaks 2011,

 p. 62).

 As we shall see, al-Samaw'al also retains remnants of Greek conceptions while

 adopting and extending the more developed notions of his direct predecessors. This is

 most noticeable in al-Samaw'al's conflation of numerical and geometrical magnitudes.

 To some extent, Euclid himself began this process with his definitions of plane and

 solid numbers and their sides in Elements VII. We see a similar usage by al-Samaw'al

 in proposition 5 above, where he says that the two sides of c are the two numbers a and

 b and then goes on to talk of the surface c (formed from a and b). But al-Samaw'al goes

 34 Notice that al-Samaw'al uses the word surface here as a synonym for the word product which appeared

 in the definition or specification earlier in the demonstration.

 35 For example, in this case, al-Samaw'al has used either Elements VI, 1 or VII, 17 to derive the equivalence

 of the ratios e to / and b to c. He has also used Elements V,11 and either VI,16 or VII,19.

 36 For example, see Heath (1956, p. 248).

 further. For instance, he uses two distinct terms to express the concept 'product.' The

 first is 'darb' which is from the verb 'to multiply', usually used in a general context,

 particularly arithmetic. The second, however, has geometric origins; 'musattah' which

 he uses to express the product literally translates as 'surface.' Despite these different

 origins, for al-Samaw'al these words are synonyms, as we see by the substitution of

 one for the other in the setting out and final conclusion of proposition 1 above. On

 the one hand, all such calculations yield numbers, as we see in proposition 2 where

 he multiplies by the surface of c and d, I mean by the number g. But on the other

 hand, the geometric meaning allows him to quote the geometric Elements 11,1 in an

 arithmetic context like proposition 3.

 Why keep two different words for what had become the same concept? Having

 two words for multiplication may have been helpful in following the rhetoric of the

 many repeated multiplications in these propositions. For example, in proposition 1,

 the careful use of both words in the product of the surface of the first and the second

 by the surface of the third and the fourth gives a structure to the statement that might
 not be so apparent if all the multiplications were simply products. A similar usage in

 proposition 4: the product of the surface of the square of AC by C Β by AC, makes

 it clear that the choice of word was not driven by any geometric imagery. This use

 of language shows how transitional this way of mathematical thinking was, as al

 Samaw'al and his contemporaries shifted to an orientation where the ties to geometry

 were increasingly less useful.

 Al-Samaw'al's algebra is purely rhetorical and, in particular, he has no symbolism

 to denote the algebraic powers which appear in these propositions. For the reader's
 convenience, Table 3 summarizes al-Samaw'al's terminology for geometrical and

 algebraic terms applied to arithmetic, along with their English and modern symbolic

 equivalents.

 When it comes to these higher algebraic powers, it is well known that Arabic math

 ematicians introduced new terminology37 which had a greater degree of generality

 than ever before. The names of the simplest powers of an unknown quantity (number

 or length) have come down to us from al-Khwàrizmï (2009, p. 96): the unknown quan

 tities themselves are called root, side or thing, while an unknown quantity multiplied

 by itself is called mâ/38 (an arithmetical term) or square (its geometric equivalent).

 37 See for instance, Berggren (2003, pp. 102-103) or (2007, pp. 542-544).

 Later writers expanded this vocabulary. Abu Kâmil (2012, pp. 444, 454, 478) uses

 cube39 (a thing multiplied by a square), square-square (a square multiplied by itself),
 cube-cube (a cube multiplied by itself) and square-square-square-square (a square

 square multiplied by itself). There does not, at this stage, seem to be any systematic

 generation of these powers, in that names seem to grow by concatenation as products
 appear in algebraic calculations, typically expansions of squared binomials. Laws

 involving products of these powers are certainly known, presumably from adding up

 the number of factors involved. For example, Abu Kâmil knows that multiplying cube

 by square gives the same as multiplying square-square by thing (Abu Kâmil 2012, p.
 454), but this product does not seem to have a standard name. Such standard names

 seem to appear with the translation of Diophantus into Arabic. Thus, al-Karajï adopts

 Diophantus's name square-cube for the product just mentioned, but whereas Diophan

 tus's powers were generated from the products mentioned in their names Diophantus
 of Alexandria (1893, pp. 2-5) (as with Abu Kâmil's names above), al-Karajï also

 defines his powers by the successive addition of another single factor thing (Woepcke

 1982, p. 48). With this idea, he extends Diophantus's list (which went up to what

 we would now call the sixth power) so that it includes powers up to the ninth power,

 while retaining Diophantus's naming strategy of combining square's and cube's. Al

 Samaw'al follows this tradition, and the top row of his table of binomial coefficients

 (Fig. 10) shows names that go up to the twelfth power. However, it is important to note

 that, with this naming system, the recursive relationship between successive powers
 is not visible numerically (as we might now see in the numerical index of an jc",

 for example). Indeed, this relationship is effectively obscured by having the powers

 expressed as the appropriate combinations of square and cube. In the next section,

 we shall see how al-Samaw'al removes this obscurity with the help of diagrams and

 tabular arrays.

 3.2 The role of diagrams

 There are two different traditions of diagrams represented in the text. The first, with

 each number represented as a lettered line segment, is seen in propositions 1, 2 and

 5 (see Figs. 1, 3, 8). This is arguably the most common in the Arabic tradition of
 diagrams and is in essence similar to Euclidean practice. In the second group of
 diagrams, an initial sum is represented as a partitioned and lettered line segment, but

 all other numbers involved in the proposition are omitted. These simple diagrams are

 seen in propositions 3 and 4 (see Figs. 5, 7). Such diagrams can be traced back to

 Heron's proofs 'without a diagram' in his commentary on book II of the Elements,

 which al-Samaw'al was possibly familiar with, as we said earlier, through al-Nayrizi's

 commentary (Lo Bello 2009). Al-Samaw'al's use of diagrams in this section thus is

 another example of the way in which he both follows and adapts earlier Greek usage (in

 particular Euclid's use of diagrams in the arithmetical books (VII to IX) of the Elements

 which he would have seen in Arabic translation).40 Like Euclid, al-Samaw'al makes

 no comment about his diagrams and, in both cases, the diagrams appear at first sight

 to be an unstructured display of the numbers discussed in the relevant proposition.

 However, we shall see that some features of al-Samaw'al's diagrams reflect important
 relationships between these numbers and that similar structures can be found in some

 Euclidean diagrams. In the absence of an abstract symbolic notation for the unknown

 and its various powers, the alignment and 'flow' of such arrays function as a shorthand

 for the processes of reasoning, offering a comprehensive view of the mathematical

 relations of the proposition.

 The diagram accompanying proposition 1 consists of two rows of lettered line
 segments (Fig. 11). The letters correspond to the various numbers discussed in the

 proposition, and as in Euclidean practice (Netz 1999, p. 71), they are named in alpha

 betic order as they arise during the demonstration. Thus, four arbitrary numbers, a, b,

 c and d, are listed in order in the top row, while the relevant products of pairs of these

 numbers, e = ab, f — ac, g = bd and h = cd, are listed in the bottom row.41 It is

 tempting to imagine a teacher drawing and labeling each line as each new number is

 encountered during the demonstration.

 The diagram associated with proposition 2 seems to have been constructed in the

 same way (Fig. 12). Thus, the proposition claims that (erf)3 = c3d3 and the diagram

 40 Heath (1956), and Euclid (1883-1916) before him, are not reliable witnesses to the manuscript tradition

 regarding diagrams. Forthe Elements, we shall rely on the witness of the Tehran manuscripts of the Elements

 in Arabic, as well as the more readily accessible Bodleian manuscript. For Al-Bâhir, we refer to the Aya

 Sofya 2718 manuscript since this is the only manuscript with completed diagrams.

 41 Just as in Arabic writing, these diagrams are usually read from right to left.

 Revisiting Al-Samaw'al's table of binomial coefficients.

 561

 shows the numbers constructed as we go through the demonstration. Again, alphabetic
 order indicates the order in which the numbers are named or constructed. Thus, al

 Samaw'al begins by naming the cubes (a = c3 and b = d3) and their corresponding
 sides (c and d). He then constructs the corresponding squares (e = c2 and / = d2)

 and finally constructs the products of the two sides (g = cd) and of the two cubes
 (h = ab).

 However, this diagram seems to be not just recording these quantities but also

 highlighting the key relationships between them. Thus, the top and bottom rows list

 the increasing powers of the basic quantities c and d, and the columns seem to group

 them according to their degrees. For example, linear quantities (c and d) are shown
 in the first (right-most) column, quadratic quantities (e = c2 and / = d2) in the
 second column (from the right) and cubic quantities (a = c3 and b = d3) in the third

 column. The products (g = cd and h = ab) are drawn at a level between the two rows,

 perhaps symbolizing a mixture, and in the same degree-based order, but their exact

 placement (with h further to the left and the line for g drawn horizontally instead of

 vertically) suggests a looser connection to the other components of the diagram. Thus,

 this diagram is carrying some of the information that nowadays we would record in
 the algebraic symbolisme2, d2, c3, d3, cd and (cd)3.

 By contrast, al-Samaw'al's diagrams for propositions 3 and 4 (the binomial expan
 sions for η = 3 and η = 4) consist of a single line segment A Β representing the
 number that has been divided into two parts AC and CB (Fig. 6). Such diagrams
 would probably have been familiar from Heron's commentary on book II of the Ele

 ments (Lo Bello 2009). Perhaps understandably there is no attempt to extend Euclid's

 partitioned square which illustrates his demonstration of the case η = 2 (Elements II,

 4). The extension of algebra to higher powers has made such a diagram either difficult

 (for proposition 3) or impossible (for proposition 4) to draw. By using a divided line

 to record essential relationships, al-Samaw'al can transfer the bulk of the calculations

 (applications of what we would call the distributive law) to the reader's imagination,

 thus helping the reader through calculations which reach beyond plane geometry,
 involving third and fourth powers.

 Al-Samaw'al's diagram for proposition 5 (which, in modern terms, asserts that
 (ab)4 = a4b4) has a similar (but not identical) structure42 to the one we saw for the

 related proposition 2 (which says that (cd)3 = c3d3). Again the numbers are labeled

 alphabetically in the order in which they arise in al-Samaw'al's exposition. Thus, al

 Samaw'al begins by naming the numbers (a and b) and their product c = ab. He then

 constructs the relevant powers of a (namely, d = a2, e = ad = a3 and / = ea = a4),

 and of b (namely, g = b2, h = gb = b3 and i — hb = b4), and of c (namely, j = c2,

 k = jc = c3 and I = kc = c4). Notice that, by naming these numbers in this order,

 and then building this order into his diagram, he encodes the relationships between

 successive powers, and then displays these relationships in a way which helps the

 reader to 'see' the ordering which we would now encode using algebraic symbolism

 42 This time the whole diagram, letters as well as lines, has been rotated 90° to fit in the margin of the

 manuscript. Unlike the diagram for proposition 2, all the lines are horizontal, allowing the structure of the

 c = ab row to follow that of the a and b rows. The blank space for this diagram in the Esat Efendi 3155
 manuscript is a similar shape and so was presumably intended to hold a similarly rotated diagram.

 Fig. 13 Transliteration of marginal diagram accompanying proposition 5, rotated clockwise 90°. Powers

 of a, b and c = ab appear in the top, bottom and middle rows, respectively. The seemingly irrelevant bottom
 row of Fig. 9 has been omitted

 and our index notation for powers. This time though, unlike the situation we saw for

 proposition 2, the diagram is read from left to right (as we follow increasing powers of

 a, b and c)43 Furthermore, the structure of the diagram is much tighter, with entries

 in each column all corresponding to the same power of a, b or c. Thus, the first and

 third rows list the increasing powers of the basic quantities a and b, while the second

 row lists the increasing powers of their product c = ab.

 Diagrams like Figs. 12 and 13, where a two-dimensional array reflects a mathemat

 ical structure within an arithmetical proposition, have antecedents in the manuscript

 tradition of Euclid's Elements44 We shall content ourselves here with looking at two

 propositions (VII,27 and VIII,2) where the reader is offered such structured diagrams.

 As witnesses to the manuscript tradition, we shall use the Tehran Elements (xxxx) (as
 evidence of the Arabic tradition) and the Bodleian Elements (xxxx) (from the Greek

 tradition but more readily accessible than the Tehran manuscripts). Firstly, consider the

 diagram accompanying proposition VII,27: if two numbers are prime to one another,

 then so are their squares, and so are their cubes. Figures 14 and 15 show the rele

 vant images from the above manuscripts, and Fig. 16 gives clearer drawings of each
 diagram.

 The setting out of this proposition says45

 Let α, β be two numbers prime to one another, let a by multiplying itself make

 γ and by multiplying γ make 8, and let β by multiplying itself make e, and by

 multiplying e make ζ.

 Thus, the proposition deals with numbers α, β and their squares and cubes. Euclid

 constructs the powers of a first, γ — a2 and <5 = a3, and then of β, with e = β2 and

 ζ = β3. The relationship between these powers is displayed clearly in the Bodleian

 image. In Fig. 16 (right), these powers are displayed down the left and right columns

 43 This change of direction does not seem to be caused by the rotated orientation of the diagram, since the

 letters (and so the actual page) have been rotated too. Perhaps this demonstration, and its diagram, comes

 from a different source. This may help explain why al-Samaw'al offered two different demonstrations that
 (cd)3 = c3d3 in propositions 2 and 5.

 44 This may come as a surprise for readers brought up on Heath's translation of Euclid's Elements (Heath

 1956), or indeed for those familiar with Heiberg's critical edition (Euclid 1883-1916), but neither author

 seems to have been concerned to reproduce the original diagrams. For a discussion of why and how modern
 editions do not contain accurate diagrams see Saito and Sidoli (2012) or De Young (2005).

 45 For the reader's convenience, we use Heath's translation but use the letters from the Bodleian manuscript.

 This matches the original Greek lettering from Heiberg's edition, except that it uses lower case rather upper
 case letters.

 (respectively) and the relationships are further strengthened by numerical examples
 (although these are almost certainly added by the scribal tradition since they are not
 referred to in the text). The diagram in the Tehran image, Fig. 16 (left), has a similar
 but looser structure, with the vertical flow broken somewhat by the squares being
 displaced outwards, as if the Bodleian diagram had been squashed vertically. In both
 cases, however, the structure of Fig. 16 closely parallels that in the first and third rows

 of Fig. 13, although this times the line segments are vertical and increasing powers go

 down the page.

 γ = α2, δ — <χβ and e = β2.

 Using these numbers, he then constructs four numbers in the same continued pro

 portion, namely

 ζ = αγ = α3, η — α<5 = α2β, θ = ae = αβ2, and κ = /Se = β3.

 We see in Fig. 19 that the diagram records some of this structure, with the given

 numbers α, β in the first row, the three numbers y, S, e in continued proportion in the

 second row, and the four numbers ζ, η, θ, κ, in continued proportion in the third row.
 Again numerical examples beside each line help to reinforce this structure. On the
 surface at least, this diagram has similar themes to Fig. 12 with powers and products

 displayed, but this time the rows of Fig. 19 represent separate sequences of numbers

 in continued proportion rather than a conscious attempt to represent degree structure.
 Similar diagrams, highlighting two-dimensional relationships between numbers,

 were also used by al-Samaw'al's more immediate predecessors. For example, Fig. 20
 shows a diagram used by Abu Kâmil in his Euclidean-style demonstration that if you

 Fig. 20 Transliteration of diagram accompanying Abu Kâmil's demonstration that the square root of a

 product is the product of the square roots. The given numbers are a and b, and their respective square roots

 are d and c. The product e = ab is placed between a and b, and its square root / = -Jab, and the product

 of the roots g = s[a\fb, are both placed between the roots c and d. (Adapted from Oaks 2011)

 multiply two numbers and then take the square root, then you get the same thing as the

 product of the roots of the original numbers (Oaks 2011). Once again, the structure of

 the diagram reflects some of the mathematical structure of the demonstration. Thus,

 (following our convention for lettering) the given numbers b and a appear in the first

 row, and their roots c = Vb and d = appear in the second row. The product e — ab

 appears between b and a, as it did in our earlier diagrams for propositions 2 and 5 (see

 Figs. 12,13), while its root / = Vab and the product of the roots g = Ja-Jb appear
 in the second row between the roots c and d.

 Finally, we note that the triangle (or Pascal Triangle) can be considered to be a

 diagram too.46 This diagram presents the reader with a dilemma, since it needs to

 be read in two different ways. Each column is constructed from top to bottom using

 data from the previous column but, to be used as al-Samaw'al intended, each column
 needs to be read from the outside ends inwards. Indeed, al-Samaw'al's statements for

 propositions 3 and 4 both follow the latter order47

 (a + b)3 = a3 + b3 + 3 (ab2 + ba2)

 and

 (a + b)4 = a4 + b4 + 4 (ab3 + ba3) + 6 a2b2

 and it requires a special effort or insight to 'unfold' these expressions and see the

 columns 1, 3, 3, 1 and 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 given in the table. Of course, these orderings

 look obvious to us, at least partly because of our algebraic symbolism. In pre-symbolic

 times, it might not have been so obvious, with the rhetorical fluency of (the equivalent

 of) a4 + b4 + 4(ab3 + ba3) + 6a2b2 providing a counter-current to the influence of

 degree diagrams like the one discussed earlier. These competing views of the binomial

 46 See Dôrfler (2004) where Dôrfler argues for a broader meaning for the term 'diagram' and discusses the

 role of these more general 'inscriptions' in mathematical reasoning.

 47 Our modern algebraic symbolism is a little misleading here. For example, it forces us to identify the

 individual parts a and b when the rhetorical form finds a way of mentioning the symmetric roles of each

 part without naming either of them: (When) any number is divided into two parts, then its cube is equal

 to the sum of the cubes of its two parts and the product of each of its parts by the square of the other part
 taken three times.

 We have retained his rhetorical names for the powers. Thus, thing is what we would now call x, mal is
 x2·, cube is x3 and so on. Reciprocals are indicated by part. We have also retained the factorizations in his
 numerical examples. Notice that in the case χ = 2 these factorizations mirror the names of the powers. To
 save space, we have omitted the two outermost columns at each end of the table, corresponding to the 8th
 and 9th powers

 expansions make al-Karajï's achievement all the more impressive. To construct the
 triangle, he not only had to notice that the column entries arose from calculations like
 3+1=4 (done twice) and 3 + 3 = 6, done in no particular order, but also had to
 observe that following some variation of degree order (for example, making the rows
 of the triangle correspond to the degree of the second term) made those calculations
 follow a simple pattern.

 As we have seen, al-Samaw'al's rhetorical rendering of his quantities (square, cube,
 square-square, and so on; see Table 3) does not easily indicate the various mathematical

 relationships between them (there is no 'obvious' mathematical relationship between
 the words 'cube' and 'square-square,' for instance). However, he does show an inno
 vative attempt to present his quantities in a manner which demonstrates more clearly

 the mathematical relations between his objects. This is not by symbolic representation,
 but rather by diagrammatic arrays in which mathematical relations are embodied via
 the relative spatial positioning of their contents. This can be seen most distinctly in

 his diagram in the first chapter of the first section of Al-Bâhir, in which he presents a
 diagrammatic array of his unknown quantities, arranged in successive 'powers' (see
 Fig. 21; Table 4).

 Along the top row are numbers, this time in abjad form: Ό' is in the middle,
 and to the left and to the right, the numbers increase by one (up to 9). These are

 S. Bajri et al.

 effectively the 'indices' for the increasing degrees of his unknown quantities, although

 he has no means to tag these on to a symbolic token for the unknown (such as we are

 familiar with today in expressions such as xn). Instead, their relations are exhibited by

 means of a tabular array. In the row underneath these numbers are listed al-Samaw'al's

 rhetorical expressions for each of his quantities. Under zero is placed the word for 'one'

 or 'unit' (to represent our equivalent λ:0), and then proceeding leftwards, under the

 glyph Ί,' the Arabic shay (equivalent to xl), under the glyph '2,' the Arabic word

 mal (equivalent to x2) and so on. Proceedings rightwards, he lists his terminology

 for successive fractional powers of his quantities. This diagram, then, is directed at

 capturing relations between his quantities spatially. The relations are captured not by

 symbolic markers, but rather by relative positioning. Furthermore, one reasons not

 via numerical-symbolic manipulations, but rather diagrammatically.48 As one moves

 to the left or right in the diagram, one detects and establishes relationships between

 the quantities, as al-Samaw'al himself explains to his readers when describing how to

 multiply these powers (Berggren 2003, p. 114).

 This principle can also be applied to his diagrams in our passages in question. This

 can be seen most prominently in the table of binomial coefficients itself, the spatial

 arrangement and alignment of whose entries contain multiple mathematical relation

 ships and can be 'read' in various directions. However, this principle is also invoked

 in the diagrams accompanying his propositions. Letters which symbolize the various

 quantities in al-Samaw'al's propositions have been placed in a diagrammatic array

 which preserves mathematical relations. For instance, in the diagram accompanying

 proposition 5 (Fig. 13) along the top line, we have presented the letters a, d, e, f,

 which, as the text reveals, are successive powers of a. This is the same in the second

 and third row, but rather with successive powers of c and b, respectively. In addition,

 reading vertically down the first column, we have a, c, b. However, c is also the prod

 uct of a and b, so that the essence of the proposition (i.e., that c4 = (ab)4) is captured

 visually by the respective arrangements of the three rows. Therefore, the reasoning set

 out in the text is captured and can be followed diagrammatically in the array.49

 Thus, al-Samaw'al offers a rendering of quantities and their relations which is in

 many senses more mathematically descriptive than the rhetorical means he invokes, but

 quite different to the symbolic representations of unknown quantities which are famil

 iar to us. He represents relationships by spatial arrangement on the page, presenting

 quantities and their mutual relations diagrammatically so that they can be understood

 as one moves vertically or horizontally within the diagram. In the next section, we

 shall consider how these structured diagrams might have helped al-Samaw'al's readers
 to follow the rhetoric of his demonstrations.50

 48 Within a century of so, Ibn al-Bannâ' was offering a rule for calculating the 'exponent' of a term and

 observing that you add exponents when you multiply different terms together Ibn al-Bannâ' (1969). We

 would like to thank the referee for pointing out this reference to us.

 49 It is true that none of the above-mentioned authors (Euclid, or his Bodleian or Tehran copyists, or
 Abu Kamil, or al-Samaw'al himself) makes any comment about this use of their diagrams. However, the

 consistency of practice across time and cultural differences makes it unlikely that the observed structure is
 accidental.

 50 Of course, the structured diagrams discussed above may also have helped Euclid's and Abu Kâmil's
 readers (Oaks 2011) too.

 3.3 Al-Samaw'al and mathematical induction revisited

 After carefully setting out the five propositions, al-Samaw'al then goes on to describe

 the procedure for the construction of his table of binomial coefficients. But before he

 does, he makes some telling comments about generalizing the essence of these propo

 sitions for higher powers (see Sect. 2.2.13). This passage has been deemed especially

 significant (see Rashed 1972, 1994, pp. 63-68) because of the appearance here of the

 so-called 'Pascal Triangle' in a distinctly different and notably earlier context, but also

 for the appearance of a mode of reasoning closely related to mathematical induction—

 a style of proof which has traditionally been viewed as being first formalized by Blaise

 Pascal in 1654 (Acerbi 2000, p.57), five centuries after al-Samaw'al.

 The search for antecedents to mathematical induction has led to much argument

 in the scholarly literature, with possible attestations being reported ever earlier. Thus,

 Vacca thought he recognized induction in the work of Maurolico in the sixteenth cen

 tury (Vacca 1909; Bussey 1917; Ernest 1982) and Rabinovitch (1970) found it in the

 work of Levi ben Gerson in the fourteenth century. On the other hand, Freudenthal

 (1953) reasserted the primacy of Pascal and classified earlier methods as archaic pre

 cursors of the form of mathematical induction used by Pascal. Rashed (1972) extended

 Freudenthal's classification to take into account yet another precursor of induction that

 he found in this present extract from al-Samaw'al's Al-Bâhir in the twelfth century.

 Finally, several writers have debated the possible occurrence of induction in the ancient

 mathematical corpus, including in Euclid and Plato (Itard 1961 ; Fowler 1994; Unguru
 1991, 1994; Acerbi 2000).

 These disputes show that the quest to identify the first to articulate this mode of

 reasoning is somewhat futile, particularly given that many early attempts were bound

 to the context and conventions of their own cultures of inquiry in which the rigors of

 formal logic, symbolic styles of expression and abstract conceptions of number were

 either irrelevant or far from purview. Indeed, as Acerbi (2000, p. 58) succinctly put it,

 the issue became to some extent historiographical: '...every single scholar sets up his
 own reading of the principle of [complete induction], and on this basis he is able to

 affirm or to deny that specific proofs constitute well formed examples of it.' Acerbi

 then rather delightfully introduced his own contributions on the issue as 'adding to
 the confusion,' rather than trying to settle the matter. More broadly his comments

 touch upon a wider systemic issue in histories of mathematics: investigations which

 prioritize locating the first instance of an important mathematical principle, rule or

 concept are likely to encounter difficulty defending their resulting position.51 In light

 of this, then, and taking our cue from Acerbi, we seek to explore what al-Samaw'al's

 aim in this section of Al-Bâhir was and the extent to which his mode of reasoning has

 affinities with the more formal process of mathematical induction.

 Indeed, there has been a proliferation of ways in which to identify mathematical

 induction in historical sources. After much scholarly discussion, this type of reasoning

 is generally realized as a spectrum of techniques which include at one end the method

 51 For the historiographical implications surrounding the issues of priority see, for instance, Clark and
 Montelle (2012).

 S. Bajrietal.

 of generalizing examples and incomplete induction52 through to formal mathematical

 induction at the other. Rashed (1994), building on the work of Freudenthal (1953),

 highlights three precursors of mathematical induction which he labels R\, Ri and R$.

 Two of these come from Freudenthal (see Rashed 1994, p. 73). Thus, Rashed's R2

 is Freudenthal's quasi-general method of proof, where the proof would be valid for

 any positive integer η but is, in fact, given only for one specific value of n. Similarly

 Rashed's #3 is Freudenthal's regression, where the same argument is repeated for

 each successively smaller integer until the smallest case is reached (again this method

 typically starts with a specific integer, but the argument is thought of as applying more

 generally). Rashed expands this catalog by introducing R\, a method which deals with

 specific values of η but attempts to prove the transition η to η + 1 in a uniform way

 that does not depend on η (Rashed 1994, p. 76). Rashed argues that al-Samaw'al uses

 this last form of reasoning in the section of Al-Bâhir which we have been discussing,
 and in this section, we wish to examine this claim.

 If we express his propositions in algebraic form (to help modern readers appreciate

 the overall structure) then al-Samaw'al proves the following results:

 1. (ab)(cd) = (ac)(bd)
 2. (cd)3 = c3d3
 3. (a + b)3 = a3 + b3 + 3(ab2 + ba2)
 4. (a + b)4 = a4 + b4 + 4(ab3 + ba3) + 6a2b2
 5. (ab)4 = a4b4 He then states the fifth-power equivalents of the last two proposi

 tions:

 6. (cd)5 = c5d5
 7. (a + b)5 = a5 + b5 + 5(ab4 + ba4) + 10(a2b3 + b2a3)

 saying that they can be proved, using the same methods, by anyone who has understood

 those earlier demonstrations. In each case, the assertion concludes with a phrase like
 'and so on,' or 'in increasing order'. The meaning of this phrase is reasonably clear

 in the case of proposition 5, but for proposition 4 al-Samaw'al needs to indicate how
 those 'coefficients' (3, then 4 and 6, then 5 and 10) can be calculated. The ensuing

 description shows how to construct and use the entries in his triangle, but it does not

 give any further explanation as to why these are the right numbers to use.

 It seems likely that al-Samaw'al saw this section of material as a coherent unit,

 so the order of the material may hold clues to his way of thinking. In particular, the

 way he interleaves the two themes, (ab)n = anbn and the binomial expansion of

 (a + b)n, suggests that he may have been at least as interested in the general methods
 of demonstration as in the results themselves.

 Al-Samaw'al's demonstrations of propositions 2 through to 4 all deal with a transi

 tion from a known case of a particular η to the next one η + 1. proposition 5 is slightly

 different in that it proceeds from a known case η = 2 through a case η = 3 (which he

 has already proven a different way in proposition 2) and on to the case η = 4. This

 might show that he was interested not just in the particular instance covered in the

 52 In the terminology of Rashed (1994, p. 80) and Acerbi (2000, p. 60, footnote 13). This seems to be the

 induction of the philosophers, where from a few cases you hope that you can draw a general conclusion.
 Rashed and Acerbi refer to mathematical induction as complete induction.

 proposition, but rather its connection to other instances. Al-Samaw'al's assertions that

 the η = 5 case of proposition 5 can be proved 'by the same method', and that this can
 be done 'and so on in increasing order'—and similar assertions about the η = 5 case

 of proposition 4—mean that he could see some similarity between the way the case

 η = 4 was proved (from the case η = 3 perhaps) and the way to prove those higher
 cases.

 However, there are some steps that al-Samaw'al remains silent on which makes us

 less sure of the emphasis of this passage. For instance, he does not make a similar

 assertion after proposition 2, and he makes no comment about achieving another

 demonstration of proposition 2 while proving proposition 5, and indeed, he makes
 no comment about the similarity between the step η = 2 -* η = 3 and the step
 η = 3 -> η = 4 within the demonstration of proposition 5. This may indicate that
 there is some room for doubt about his intent.

 Furthermore, while the general idea of multiplying the expansion for (a + b)"-1

 through by (a + b) and expanding is clear enough, it is not clear in what sense al

 Samaw'al has achieved a proof of the induction step for the binomial theorem. First

 and foremost, al-Samaw'al lacks a way to express the mechanics of recognizing like

 terms and gathering them in the general case. Even for proposition 4 (the expansion

 of (a + b)4) just recognizing all the like terms, which we can accomplish in a single
 line

 but (3a2b)a = 3a3b, (3a2b)b = 3a2b2, (3b2a)a = 3a2b2 and (3b2a)b = 3è3a,

 takes him half a dozen lines of rhetoric.

 Both of al-Samaw'al's demonstrations for (ab)3 = a^b^ (in his demonstrations of

 propositions 2 and 5) can be adapted to construct a fully general induction step. But

 the lack of an algebraic notation for expressing the general statement seems to render

 this step out of reach for al-Samaw'al. However, al-Samaw'al may have achieved this

 in an alternative fashion. That is, his accompanying diagram, and the way in which
 the reader is guided through the array, offer a visual representation of both the basic

 mathematical relationships and the method of progress from the case η = 2 to the case

 η = 3. Furthermore, the diagram does this in a way that allows the perceptive reader
 to 'see' what the general induction step would look like and how it would proceed.
 We explore this next.

 3.3.1 Mathematical induction via diagrammatic reasoning?

 Algebraic symbolism can be a powerful aid to creative thinking in mathematics. In

 the absence of such symbolism, diagrams can sometimes play a similar role (see

 for example Grosholz 2007; Dôrfler 2004; Netz 1999; Macbeth 2010). Without any

 symbolic algebra, it might seem a tall order for al-Samaw'al's readers to 'understand

 what we have done' and see what the so-called 'same method' might be (we urge the

 reader to read our literal translations in Sect. 2.2 without the help of the paraphrases).

 However, let us look a little closer at the diagrams accompanying the demonstrations

 of propositions 2 and 5, and particularly at how these diagrams might interact with
 the demonstrations.

 We begin with the diagram for proposition 2. The defining relationships for the

 quantities in the diagram could be represented by the arrows in Fig. 22.

 Thus, the arrows along the two rows represent the generation of successive powers

 of c and d, while the diagonal arrows represent the construction of the products g — cd
 and h = ab. At the start of the demonstration, al-Samaw'al reminds us of a known

 fact, another relationship between some the quantities in the diagram: ef = g2. His

 demonstration is basically a process of getting from this relationship to the next case,

 namely ab = g3. To function as an induction step, or even as an example of Rashed's

 R\ mode of reasoning (Rashed 1994, p. 76), this process needs to be general, in the

 sense that it is independent of the actual case under discussion. What is the process?

 It consists of three steps:

 1. multiply both quantities (here ef and g2) by cd or (equivalently) g

 2. use proposition 1 to rearrange the resulting equality (giving (ec)(df ) = g3)

 3. recognize the bracketed terms as the appropriate powers of c and d.

 We claim that the diagram helps the reader to make this final identification step and to

 see what would be needed to use the 'same method' to prove the next case. Thus, to

 show that (cd)4 = c4d4 the reader could use a diagram as in Fig. 23, where quantities

 would be defined in a similar order to the ones in Fig. 12 so that e and / are the squares

 of c and d, and g and h are the cubes, while i = cd and j = ab.

 But the fact that al-Samaw'al actually offers second demonstration as part of propo

 sition 5 may indicate that it was not so easy to see how the demonstration of proposition

 Fig. 24 Basic relationships in

 2 generalizes to the higher powers. Perhaps the first two steps above were harder to

 see in the diagram.

 On the other hand, as we shall now see, his demonstration of proposition 5 can be

 carried out more or less entirely within its diagram. As with the diagram for proposition

 2, the ordered labeling of the diagram imposes a structure on the diagram which reflects

 some of the mathematical structure of the setting out. Thus, multiplying a and b gives c,

 which we can think of as a vertical relationship within the first column of the diagram.

 Next the powers of these three numbers are given by d, e, f and g, h, i and j, k, I,

 respectively, a list which imposes a horizontal flow along the rows of the diagram,

 with powers increasing as we move from left to right (See Fig. 24).

 The demonstration begins by recalling two relationships c = ab and j — dg that

 tell us about the structure of each of the first two columns of the diagram. Again, if

 this demonstration is to function as an induction step, even at the level of Rashed's

 R\, then the process of going from j = dg (or (ab)2 = a2b2) to k = eh and onwards

 to I = fi needs to be in some sense independent of whether it started at j = dg or

 k — eh and so on. As with the demonstration of proposition 2, we can follow the

 process in the diagram. Thus, the first step uses Elements VIII,5 to express the ratio

 c : j (the first step along the middle row) as the compound of the ratios a : d and

 b : g (the first steps along the two outer rows). But multiplication by a, b and c carries

 us along the upper, lower and middle rows (respectively) in sequences which are in

 continued proportion. Hence, j : k (the second step along the middle row) must be the

 compound of the ratios d : e and g : h (the second steps along the two outer rows). But

 we know that j = dg, so the converse of Elements VIII,5 tells us that k = eh. This

 ought to complete the induction step, but al-Samaw'al repeats the process to show

 that I = fi. Perhaps he wanted to show that the same process can indeed be used and

 that it just corresponds to moving over one column in the diagram. At any rate, it is

 now clear how the rule can be extended to higher powers, and it is the structure of the

 diagram which makes this clear.53

 3.4 Concluding remarks

 The passage we have considered here from al-Samaw'al's Al-Bâhir has been singled
 out by past studies because of its inclusion of a table of binomial coefficients and

 the related mathematical reasoning which has similarities to mathematical induction.

 However, through a careful, complete, and historically sensitive examination of the

 whole passage in its entirety, we have revealed that there is more significance to

 53 We would like to emphasize that we are not claiming that al-Samaw'al is using the form of mathematical

 induction that was first formulated by Pascal, but rather that his diagrams represent a way in which he could
 convey to his readers the similarity of all the proofs n=k-+n = k + 1.

 al-Samaw'al's exposition than being a more-or-less casual expression or informai
 anticipation of mathematical induction.

 Previous accounts of this passage have focused solely on al-Samaw'al's text, ignor

 ing the accompanying diagrams and sometimes relying on modern paraphrases to help

 the reader follow al-Samaw'al's arguments. Our literal translation of the whole pas

 sage brings out the rhetorical nature of al-Samaw'al's exposition and highlights the

 very real difficulties faced by his readers as they attempted not just to follow the

 arguments but also, as bidden by al-Samaw'al, to extend the same arguments to more

 general situations. Looking through modern eyes, as in our paraphrases, it is easy for

 us to see embryonic arguments using mathematical induction which would achieve

 the generalizations claimed by al-Samaw'al, but looking solely at the text, it is difficult
 to see how even al-Samaw'al himself could have done this.

 We argue that key to al-Samaw'al's line of reasoning are his structured diagrams,

 which have evolved from the Euclidean tradition, but which are used with a slightly

 different intent in this context. We have seen that both al-Samaw'al's presentation and

 the content of his propositions are also clearly inspired by Greek mathematics. But

 we have also revealed how al-Samaw'al's mathematical ambitions have outgrown the

 Euclidean geometric context, now contemplating four-dimensional, five-dimensional

 or even higher dimensional products. Despite this though, al-Samaw'al remains com
 mitted to retaining some features of this mode of exposition (such as referring to

 products as 'surfaces,' or using propositions about parallelogram areas to justify higher

 dimensional calculations) even though, at first sight, they seem no longer useful or

 maybe even unhelpful to him.

 In particular, we have advanced the notion that al-Samaw'al's diagrams are not just

 intended to be representative of a specific mathematical relation, but also prescriptive
 of a process of reasoning. Although al-Samaw'al's text includes a method closer to

 that of generalizing examples than a formal account of inductive reasoning, we argue

 that his diagrams more immediately concern the latter. The active movement which

 the diagrams compel the reader to engage in, in both a horizontal and vertical direc

 tion, may be emblematic of a process he wants to model for extending his results
 to higher powers in a manner similar to an inductive step, albeit achieved diagram

 matically. Alphabetic ordering, alignment and mutual arrangement of elements in a

 diagrammatic array all seem directed to this aim. Indeed, where notational symbolism

 could not reveal the inherent relationships going from one 'power' of the unknown to

 the next, relative positioning in the diagram could. Therefore, reading and interpret

 ing both text and diagram as an integrated whole in this way gives us new insight, a

 more complete picture of al-Samaw'al's intentions and a better understanding of how

 rhetorical mathematics could make progress in the absence of the power of algebraic

 symbolism. We also see a more complex picture of the development of mathematical

 induction, not a story of linear progress but more of a tapestry of ideas, with diagram

 matic reasoning appearing as a hitherto unnoticed thread, enriching a story that can

 be traced from Plato to Pascal, and beyond.
