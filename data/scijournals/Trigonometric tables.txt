 Trigonometrie tables: explicating their construction
 principles in China

 Abstract The trigonometric table and its construction principles were introduced to

 China as part of calendar reform, spear-headed by Xu Guangqi (1562-1633) in the

 late 1620s to early 1630s. Chinese scholars attempted and succeeded in uncovering

 how the construction principles were established in the seventeenth century and then

 in the eighteenth century expanded to include more algorithms to compute the values

 of trigonometric lines. Successful as they were in discoursing the construction prin

 ciples, most Chinese scholars did not actually construct trigonometric tables anew. In

 the early nineteenth century, a revolutionary approach was developed, which resem

 bles computing a finite sum of power series to trigonometric functions of an arbitrary

 arc less than a one-half circle. Though hailed by many modern historians as Chinese

 achievements in developing "infinite series" of trigonometric functions, this approach

 was viewed by the actors at the time as a quick means to construct trigonometric
 tables. Interestingly, even with these "quick" methods, no trigonometric table was

 constructed. Besides the fact that constructing a trigonometric table afresh is a time

 consuming business, the classification of the trigonometric table and their construction

 principles into different genres of knowledge by scholars offers an additional expla

 nation of drastically uneven treatment of trigonometric tables and their construction

 principles.

 1 Introduction

 It is said that one of the defining characteristics of trigonometry as a subject is "its sys

 tematic ability to convert back and forth between measures of angles and of lengths."1

 If such a view is to be taken, considering the fact that trigonometric functions of an

 angle (or an arc on a circle with a predetermined radius) in the early modern period

 were expressed in terms of the length of associated line segments,2 one would log

 ically reach the conclusion that one of the ultimate goals of trigonometry was to

 construct trigonometric tables, which juxtapose measures of angles and the lengths of

 the associate line segments.

 The story of trigonometry in China begins with the Jesuits at the beginning of the

 seventeenth century.3 Though overtly simplified, the Jesuits' entries into the Chinese

 courts were often depicted as victorious, based on "exactitude in the calculation of

 celestial phenomena, especially solar and lunar eclipses."4 In the midst of trigonom

 etry, the mathematical basis for astronomy and calendric science stood a powerful

 computational tool, trigonometric tables, which has not been systematically discussed

 in the historiography in English.5 It might not be feasible, nor is it necessarily advan

 tageous to assess how much of the Jesuit's accurate prediction should attribute to the

 1"What distinguishes trigonometry as a subject in its own right is its systematic ability to convert back and

 forth between measures of angles and of lengths"; see Van Brummelen (2009,9).

 2 In traditional Chinese mathematics, the concept of an angle was described in terms of the arc subtended

 by the angle on a circle. The discussions in this paper do not make a point to distinguish them.

 3 Before the arrival of the Jesuits, the Chinese had obtained certain "proto-trigonometric" results in astron

 omy, calendrical science, and land surveying, including an eighth-century "tangent table." Trigonometry

 as an independent subject never developed in China prior to the Jesuit's presence in China. For a survey of
 the results obtained by the Chinese before 1600s, see Chen (2010,68-72).

 4 Based on the analysis of the degree of precision of both the calculations and the observations ofluni-solar

 eclipses, Lu (2007) discussed the competition among the European, Chinese, and Islamic methods in astro

 nomical predictions in late Ming China (1368-1644) and reached the conclusion that Chongzhen Emperor's
 (reigned 1627-1644) decision of going forward with the calendar reform by adopting the European method

 was less due to its superiority of calculation and prediction, but more out of the frustration with the failure

 of the Chinese method. After the fall of Ming dynasty, in a contest of the solar eclipse prediction recorded

 in 1644, the Western method and its observation tools won by achieving a perfect match (yan 驗）of the

 predictions (yiice 預測）of the first contact, the totality, and the fourth contact with the observed times. See
 Huang (1990).

 J In the historiography of trigonometry in Chinese, Li (1927) discusses the various trigonometric tables and

 certain aspects of trigonometry that appeared in mathematical treatises published between the seventeenth

 and nineteenth century in China. Yan (1958) describes the Chinese achievements in spherical trigonometry

 and emphasizes that these results were obtained without utilizing plane or spherical triangles. Bai Shangshu

 identifies some of the European sources for the trigonometric treatise Dace 大測(Grand Measure) in

 Bai (1963) and for Celiang quanyi 測量全義（Complete Principles of Measurement) in Bai (1984). Chu

 Ping-yi examines the role played by the computational device such as trigonometric tables in the scientific

 development. See Chu (1999). Dong Jie in his doctoral thesis analyzes the trigonometric treatises composed

 in late Ming and early Qing China between 1630s and 1722. He focuses on the reasoning and proofs of

 trigonometric properties, including the construction principles of trigonometric tables; see Dong (2011).
 In the literature in English, Isaia Iannoccone discussed the Table of Eight Lines dividing the Circle，an

 early trigonometric table introduced by the Jesuits into China in 1630s and identified its European source;
 see Iannaccone (1998). Cullen (1982) describes the first Chinese table of tangents, its construction, the

 accuracy of its entries, and its origin. Needham's scant discussion of trigonometry in China focuses on

 computational prowess of the trigonometric tables; nevertheless, the story of trigono

 metric tables and how they were “domesticated” by Chinese scholars in the seventeenth

 to the early nineteenth century through the discussions of their principles of construc

 tion is intellectually illuminating and interesting in its own right.

 This paper will examine the trigonometric tables and analyze the treatises explaining

 the principles of construction by the Jesuits as well as by Chinese scholars from
 1630s to 1850s. The tables and/or the accompanying treatises chosen for analysis

 have certain characteristics of “firsts” in China: the first complete trigonometric table,

 the first treatise discussing trigonometry, the first logarithmic trigonometric table,

 the first treatise that explicitly describes the Chinese counterpart to trigonometric

 tables, the first treatise providing complete geometric constructions and “proofs” to

 the construction principles, and last but not the least, the first trigonometric table

 constructed from anew by following the construction principles by â Chinese scholar.
 These texts are summarized in Table 1.

 In addition, we will also examine the trigonometric table and the construction prin

 ciples included in the compendium, Yiizhi shuli jingyun 御製数理精蘊(the Essence

 of Numbers and their Principles, Imperially Composed), one of the editorial projects

 taken by the court following Kangxi Emperor's 康熙（1654-1722) decrees toward the

 end of his reign. Other trigonometric tables or treatises discussing properties that can

 be construed as construction principles did exist in China. They are excluded in our

 analysis because in most cases, the trigonometric tables and the construction principles

 do not appear together.6

 In the year of 1839, a treatise by Ming Antu 明安圓（1692-1763)，7 Geyuan milii

 jiefa 割圆密率捷法(Quick Methods for the Circle's Division and Precise Lii), was

 published posthumously. This treatise utilizes a series of similar isosceles triangles to

 obtain equalities of numerous ratios and to derive algorithms that resemble the finite

 sum of the series expansion of trigonometric lines. These algorithms compute the

 length of the trigonometric lines directly from the given measure of an (acute) arc and

 Footnote 5 continued

 the work of Guo Shoujing 郭守敬（1231-1316)，a thirteenth-century astronomer, and contains none of the
 development after the arrival of the Jesuits; see Needham (1959,108-110).

 6 Wang Xichan 王銀鬮（1628~1682) and Dai Zhen 戴！！（1724-1777) each discussed in their respective

 trigonometric treatise the properties which form the basis of constructing trigonometric tables. Neither of

 them included trigonometric tables in his treatise; more importantly, they did not present these properties

 in the context of constructing trigonometric tables. Consequently, their treatises are not included in the

 following analysis. Among the tables discussed, Xue's table is logarithmic. A few other regular or log

 arithmic trigonometric tables during the period are still extant. Two notable ones are: Cuiwei shangfang

 shuxue 翠薇山房數學(Mathematics of Cuiwei Hillhouse, 1815) by Zhang Zuonan 張作捕（1772-1850)

 and Jiang Lintai 江趣泰(late eighteenth century), and Baxian jianbiao 八錢簡表(A Simple Table of Eight

 Lines) compiled and published by Jia Buwei 賈步緯（1840-1903) in 1903. The former was simplified

 from that in Numbers and Principles and both have no accompanying construction principles.

 'Ming Antu is also known as Minggantu in the literature. No currently known documentation, Chinese or

 Mongolian, indicates Ming's birth and death years. Most scholars in China follow the practice started by
 Li Di, who used 1692 and 1763 as Ming's birth and death years, respectively.

 d This is a treatise in the collection of Mei Wending's works in astronomy and mathematics, Lisuan quanshu

 靥算全害(Complete Writings on Mathematics and Calendric Astronomy). The current evidence shows that
 the treatise was composed by Yang Zuomei. There will be more discussions on its authorship later. Since

 it is part of the collection of Mei's works, we list Mei as a co-author. In most copies extant in China, the

 compendium contains only the construction principles; the story of the trigonometric table in Mei's Lisuan

 quanshu will, however, prove interesting to be included

 vice versa.8 Two decades before the publication of Ming's treatise, some version(s) of

 Ming's manuscript was circulated among a small circle of scholars, some of who also

 developed and published similar algorithms independently/ Chinese scholars at the

 time mostly considered these algorithms as a quick way to constructing trigonometric

 tables, instead of replacing them.

 The analysis below will show that none of the trigonometric taoies that appeared
 in China between 1630 and 1850 was constructed from scratch, with one possible

 exception, the Table of One Line. Some are translated and modified European tables,

 8 For the discussion of Ming Antu's treatise, see Luo (1988, 1990) among numerous articles in Chinese

 on the topic of “power series" in traditional Chinese mathematics. For scholarships in European languages,
 see Jami (1990, 1988). For a brief discussion on similar isosceles triangles on a circle, see Engelfriet (1998,
 415-419). Martzloff (1997, 353-361) describes the development of "infinite series" in China based on

 Ming's work. There one can also learn of various European treatises on the topic of infinite series that were

 available at the Jesuit library in seventeenth- to eighteenth-century Beijing.

 9 Dong Youcheng 董祐誠（1791-1823) claimed that he read Ming's algorithms without any accompanying

 explication or diagrams in 1819 and independently derived similar algorithms based on the same principle,
 similar isosceles triangles on a circle; see Dong Youcheng (1821, preface) and Tian (2005, 307).

 some an augmentation to an old table, and others are simplification of or direct copy of

 translated tables. In general, most treatises are detailed in disseminating the principles

 and yet scant in actual application of them to constructing tables. Such an uneven

 treatment of construction principles and the actual edification of the table highlight

 the different natures of various kinds of “scientific knowledge” in China. It also raises

 the issue of classifications of knowledge perceived by the actors in Qing China. In

 the end, we will discuss the actors' views on the functionality of the tables in contrast

 to that of their construction principles and position them in the dichotomy of li 姓

 (principles) and ji 技(skills) in the Chinese tradition.

 Most of the trigonometric terms coined in the translated treatises are still in use

 today. Their definitions in the seventeenth century are given in Fig.1 and Table 2; the

 line segments are associated with the arc DB (or angle DOB) on the circle centered at

 O (Fig.1).Strictly speaking, the lengths of these line segments are not the values of the

 corresponding modern trigonometric functions. Rather, they are equal to the products

 of the radius of the circle and the modern function values.10 In this paper, however,

 whenever we refer to these trigonometric terms in words, e.g., the sine of an arc, we

 mean the length of the line segment for the appropriate arc, while the expressions
 sin (a) or tan (a) retain the modern numerical values for the arc ot.

 2 The trigonometric table introduced by the Jesuits

 Even though there is a record of â collection of tangent lengths in the Jesuit translated

 texts published earlier,11 our analysis of trigonometric tables and texts begin with

 10 In short, the sine length of an arc of is equal to r sin (a), where r is the radius of the circle on which the

 arc a is located. In the seventeenth century, the trigonometric line segments were defined for arcs between

 0° and 180°; for an obtuse arc, the trigonometric segments for its supplementary arc are used. In particular,
 all trigonometric values are positive.

 11 The earliest record of Jesuit-introduced trigonometric tables is a table of the length of shadows in Biaodu

 Shuo 表度說（On [using the] Table and Measure) by Sabatino de Ursis (1575-1620). This table records

 shadow lengths from 0° to 90° with a 10-min increment. It can be construed as a table of tangent lengths.

 the Table of Eight Lines Dividing the Circle (hereafter, the Table of Eight Lines) and

 the treatise Grand Measure，which discusses the principles of construction. Both are

 part of the Chongzhen lish 崇禎曆書(Astronomical Compendium of the Chongzhen

 Reign, hereafter Chongzhen Astronomical Compendium)}2 The Table of Eight Lines

 is identified as a translated and simplified version of a European table.13 In spite of

 the name, the Table of Eight Lines contains a table of only six lines (equivalent to the

 modern-day six trigonometric functions) for the arcs ranging from 0。to 45。，with a

 1-min increment.14 The values in the tables are whole numbers; the values for the sine

 and cosine lines have 6 or fewer digits and the rest 9 or fewer. The table explicitly

 states that the radius of the circle is one hundred thousand in length.15 Figure 2 is

 the first page in the Table of Eight Lines for the trigonometric lines of arcs measured

 0’ to 30’.16 The entries in the top row from the right to the left are 0 (degree), sine,

 tangent line, secant line, cosine, cotangent line, cosecant line, and an empty space. The

 bottom row reads from right to left, an empty space, cosine, cotangent line, cosecant

 12 This compendium was later presented to the Qing court by Adam Schall von Bell under the name

 Xiyang xinfa lishu 西洋新法靥害(Astronomical Compendium according to the new Western methods). It

 was further revised by Ferdinand Verbiest (1623-1688). In addition to corrections on the content including

 numerical values, the title was re-fashioned as Xinfa lishu 新法靥害（Astronomical Compendium according

 to the new methods) to de-emphasize the Western, i.e., foreign, contribution. Eventually, it was included

 in Siku quanshu 四库全耆（The Complete Texts of the Four Repositories) as Xinfa suanshu 新法算耆

 (Mathematical Compendium according to the new methods).

 13 See Iannaccone (1998).

 14 The “eight lines" in the title refer to the eight trigonometric lines in Table 2. The texts before the table

 explains that the versine and coversine lines are simply the differences between the radius and the cosine

 and sine lines, and therefore, their lengths are not needed in the table. See Schreck et al. (1631,1206).

 15 The explanatory texts before the table indicate that the radius used in more detailed tables (da biao

 大表，literally great tables) might have eight, nine, or even ten digits, but the current (smaller) table has

 only six digits to expedite calculation; see Schreck et al. (1631，1206).

 ^ This page in fact are two leaves from two different pages, 8b and 9a, in Schreck et al.(1631，1208-1209).

 In the traditional thread-bound format, they are seen at the same time when the treatise is opened to that

 page.

 line, sine, tangent line, secant line, and 89 (degrees). In the first column on the right

 under 0 (degree) are the measures of the arcs from 0’ to 30’. In the last column on the

 left under the empty space, the measures are listed in the decreasing order, from (89。）

 60' to 30’. This arrangement reduces the bulk of the table in half.17 This cost-saving

 arrangement also becomes a standard practice for all the trigonometric tables in China
 afterward.

 It is worth noting that the order of the digits of the numerical values from the

 single to the tens, and on, is from left to right, contrary to the modern convention from

 right to left. For example, the value of sin(30') in the second column on the right and
 last numerical value at the bottom is 873 in the modern form although it is written

 horizontally from left to right san qi ba 三七八（three seven eight).

 Grand Measure as the first treatise of trigonometry in China was translated from

 greater than 45°; see Schreck et al. (1631，1205-1206).

 18 According to Bai Shangshu, the content of Grand Measure was taken from Bartholomaeus Pitiscus's
 (1561-1613) Trigonometriae and Simon Stevin's (1548-1620) Mémoires Mathématiques； see Bai (1963).
 Mémoires Mathématiques is a French translation of Stevin's Hypomnemata Mathematica. Both treatises

 were present in Beijing in early 1600s according to the catalogue of the North Church (Beitang，北堂).
 Bai did not explain how he determined that the content of Grand Measure was taken from Mémoires
 Mathématiques instead of Hypomnemata Mathematica.

 cally serves as a model of dissemination of construction principles in seventeenth

 and eighteenth-century China: To construct a trigonometric table in theory, first the

 lengths of the trigonometric lines for certain special arcs should be obtained. Sec

 ondly, computational algorithms such as double-arc, half-arc formulas, and the sum

 and difference formula for the sine and the cosine should be (established and) applied

 in order to find trigonometric lengths of more arcs. Next, the length of the sine line for

 the arc of the smallest measure should be approximated.19 Lastly, the same algorithms

 can be applied repeatedly to the values already obtained and the sine value of the

 smallest arc to get a more detailed and “complete” sine table and then, by applying

 the algorithms relating different trigonometric lines, a full trigonometric table. Many

 treatises followed this general pattern to treat the construction principles. A detailed

 analysis of construction principles in Grand Measure is then rightly warranted.

 The "six essentials” in the construction principles refer to the six inscribed

 regular polygons: a hexagon, a square, a triangle, a decagon, a pentagon, and a
 pentadecagon. Grand Measure provides the procedures of finding the length of

 the side of each polygon. For the validity of the procedure, it refers to the corre

 sponding theorem treating the polygon in the seminal Jihe yuanben 幾何原本，20

 the first six Books of Euclid's Elements translated and published by Xu Guangqi

 徐光啟（1562-1633) and Matteo Ricci (1552-1610) in 1607.21 Ultimately, the
 length of one side of these inscribed polygons in a circle of radius 100,000 gives

 rise to the length of the sine lines for the arcs of 30。，45。，60。，18。，36。，and
 12°.

 The three important and the two simple methods are presented in Grand Measure as

 algorithms, the conventional way mathematical properties were recorded in treatises,
 and as equalities of line segments (Table 3).22 As an example of an equality of line

 segments, the third important method (3-3), a version of the half-arc formula for the
 sine lines, is described as follows:

 19 Granted, almost all numerical values in the table are approximation, being finite decimal expressions

 for irrational numbers, Chinese scholars during Ming dynasty differentiated two types of approximate

 values. Obtained through "exact" procedures, the first kind consists of values which can be made "precise"

 if the computations can be carried on indefinitely to get infinite decimal expressions. These values were

 not considered by the scholars at the time as "approximation." The values of the other kind are, on the

 contrary, obtained through approximation procedures; they carry negligent discrepancy. The sine values for

 the special arcs belong to the former while the value of sin(l') is of the latter kind, to be discussed below.

 20 For the discussion on the translation and the content of Jihe yuanben, see Engelfriet (1998,105-286).

 21 For the hexagon, Proposition 15 in Book Four of Jihe yuanben is cited; for the square, Proposition 6

 of Book Four; for the equilateral triangle, Proposition 12 of Book Thirteen; for the decagon, Proposition

 9 of Book Thirteen; for the pentagon. Proposition 10 of Book Thirteen; and lastly for the pentadecagon,

 Proposition 16 of Book Four, which is for the construction of the inscribed regular pentadecagon, not the

 procedure of finding the length of one side. The procedure of finding the length is developed directly for
 the pentadecagon, based on certain figures in Grand Measure. See Schreck (1631, 1185-1187). It seems

 an oversight to cite Book Thirteen of Jihe yuanben in the text since only the first six Books were translated
 into Chinese.

 22 For (3-1), (3-2), and (3-3), see Schreck (1631, 1188-1189); for (2-1) and (2-2); see Schreck (1631,
 1189-1191). For more detailed discussion on the simple methods, see Li and Du (1987,463-470) and Chu
 (1999, 63).

 The square of the chord of an arc is equal to the sum of the square of its sine and
 that of its versed sine.23

 The algorithms are rather straightforward; for example, the first method of (2-2):

 Take the sine of the first arc to multiply the cosine of the second arc. Take the

 sine of the second arc to multiply the cosine of the first arc. The two products

 are added together as the dividend. Divide [the dividend] with the divisor, the

 radius, to get the sine of the arc which is the sum of the two arcs.24

 These five methods were explained with concrete examples. The term, lun ；ywど論日

 (literally, discussion says), which Jihe yuanben designates as the beginning of a proof,

 is not used consistently. With the exception of the property (2-2), the explanations of

 these methods amount to proving these properties.25

 Having introduced the construction principles of the trigonometric tables, Grand

 Measure then demonstrates how sine lengths of new arcs can be obtained by applying
 the three important methods to the values of the sine lines from the six essen

 tials. The illustration utilizes the sine value of 12°: starting with sin(12°), apply
 the half-arc formula (3-3) repeatedly to get the sine values of 6°, 3°,1。30’，and

 45’； then apply Pythagorean Theorem (3-1) to these values to get sine lengths of

 84。，87。，88°30/, 89。15’. Next apply the equation (3-3) again to sin(84°) to get the

 sine values of 42°, 21。，10。30’，and 5015’. The list of sine values is obtained by the
 application of the equations (3-3) and (3-1) in turn. The list of sine values in Grand

 23 The text reads，“各弧之全弦上方與其正半弦上偕其矢上兩方并等”;see (1631，1189). The chord of an

 arc is equal to twice of the sine line of one-half of the arc. For example, in Fig.1，the chord of the arc BDH

 is the line segment BAH, which is equal to twice of the line segment AB, which is the sine line for the arc
 BD, which is one-half of the arc BDH.

 24 The text reads, ‘似前弧之正弦乘後弧之餘弦，以後弧之正弦乘前弧之餘弦各得数并之以為食.以半徑為法而

 —，得兩弧相加為總弧之正弦”;see Schreck (1631,1189).

 Measure obtained from sin(12°) consists of the arcs of the following 49 measures26:

 12。，6°, 3°,1°30', 45'，84。，87。，88°30', 89° 15', 42。，21。，10°30', 5° 15',

 43°30', 21°45', 44。15’，48。，69。，79°30', 84°45', 46°30', 68。15'，

 45°45', 24。, 34°30',17° 15', 39°45', 23° 15', 66。，55。30'，72。45'，

 50。15，，66。45'，33。，16。30'，8°15', 27°45', 57°, 73。30'，81°45',

 62° 15', 28°30',14° 15', 36°45', 61°30', 75。45'，53°15', 30°45', 59° 15'.

 As the measures of the special arcs are all multiple of 3, the grid of sine lines obtained

 by applying the important and simple methods, consists of arcs of the measure in the

 modern form ^ where m is a positive integer and n any integer. To build a "complete"
 trigonometric table, it is necessary to find a (approximated) value of the sine line of

 the smallest measure, i.e., r sin(l’）in this case, in the table.27 In Grand Measure, the

 explanation was made explicit as follows.

 The equation (3-3) can be applied repeatedly to sin(3°) to get sin(45’)，while the

 lengths oi sine lines for the arcs of 1’ to 44’ remain to be found. After further appli

 cations of equation (3-3) to sin(45’)，the lengths of sin (11’15") and sin (22/30//) are
 obtained, 32,724.5 and 65,449, respectively. It is observed that proportionality exists
 between these small arcs and their sine lines:

 22’30" = 2x 11’15" and sin(22/30//) = 65,449 = 2 x 32,724.5 = 2 x sinGl^")

 That is, when arcs are “small’’ enough, the sine line of the arc is very close to the

 arc itself and "they more or less merge together as one line.’’28 Consequently, the rule

 of three can be applied to 22’30" and Iff to get sin(10’）= 29,088 and then to 10’ and

 1’ to get sin(l’）^ 2909.29 After the value of sin(l’）is found, the method (2-2) can

 be applied repeatedly to find the length of the sine lines for arcs of 2, through 15' and

 then to arcs of other measures up to 90°. In theory, a sine table of arcs from 0° to 90°

 with a r-increment can be constructed from the ground up by following the principles

 codified in the Six Essentials, Three Important, and Two Simple Methods.

 26 Curiously, the sine value of78°, the complementary arc of 12°, is not included in the list and consequently,

 the sine lengths of 39°,19° 30', and 9°45' are also missing from the list.

 27 This technical difficulty is wide-spread across cultures when it comes to constructing trigonometric

 tables. For the effort to find better approximation of sin(l°) in Islamic trigonometry, see Van Brummelen

 (2009,14Q-149). This fact was overlooked by many historians of Chinese mathematics. For example, Tian

 (2005) and Li (1927) did not explore this aspect in their discussion of construction principles of trigonometric
 tables.

 28 The text reads,"...略似相合为一線矣也”;see Schreck (1631，1193).

 29 In the text, the value of sin(l') is described as 2909 ruo 弱（less)，i.e., less than 2909, see Schreck (1631，
 1193).

 The text then demonstrates the ways of finding the values of tangents and secants

 via the rule of three. Take the tangent line as an example30:

 rcos(A):r sin(A) = r:r tan(A).

 With a known sine length of an arc, the cosine line can be found by applying

 Pythagorean theorem, the equation (3-1); therefore, an application of the rule of three

 will produce the length of the tangent line.31 The secant lines can be constructed

 similarly via the rule of three:

 r cos(A):r = r:r sec(A).

 When different astronomical and calendrical systems compete for dominance and

 seek "integration or appropriation," the issue of measuring units comes to the fore.

 The measuring system in the traditional Chinese astronomy for circular arcs, roughly

 365.25 du 度([Chinese] degree) as the measure for a full circle, poses an obstacle

 for the early seventeenth-century Chinese scholars who were well versed in the tra

 ditional approach and yet unfamiliar with the Western method, to utilize the newly

 available powerful computational tool, the trigonometric table. The Jesuits were well

 aware of the peril. The texts before the table indicate that there was (or should

 be) a conversion table (tonglii biao 通率表)，to convert the measures in the tradi

 tional system to the new ones (and presumably vice versa), so as to accommodate

 measures from different systems.3" Such a table, if existed in the early seventeenth

 century, is no longer extant. The degree to which the incongruent systems of mea

 sures posed such an obstacle that prevented the adaptation of trigonometric tables

 by the Chinese astronomers following the traditional approach remained to be stud

 ied;33 nevertheless, the integration of Chinese and Western methods in calendric
 science Xu Guangqi advocated in his memorials and treatises did not material
 ize.

 The terms, Six Essentials, Three Important，and Two Simple Methods, became

 synonymous with the construction principles of trigonometric tables in China even

 30 The Chinese text describes these four quantities as "four lii:’ It is understood that when four quantities

 are described as four lii，they satisfy the required equality of ratios. See Schreck (1631，1193). The concept

 of lii can be seen as early as in the Nine Chapters of the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang suanshu 九韋算術)；
 see Chemla and Guo (2004,956-959).

 31 The discussion of the tangents can be seen in Schreck (1631,1193); the secants Schreck (1631,1193
 1194).

 32 The texts in the Table of Eight Lines describe the measures of the 365.25 du as tian du 天度(celestial

 degree) and the Jesuit system of 360° as ping du 平度.See Schreck et al. (1631,1208).

 33 Chu (1999) argues that the two incongruous measures of angles prevented scholars following the tradi

 tional approach from piecemeal utilizing trigonometric tables in their computation. The effort by the Jesuits

 to provide a conversion table certainly acknowledges this obstacle and, at the same time, also suggests that

 such a conversion table should smooth the adaptation. Chu seemingly misplaces the blame on the incon

 gruous measures as the sole or at least the main reason that the calendar reform in the 1630s resulted in an

 all-or-nothing attitude when it came to adopting the Western astronomic system. Our discussion in a later

 section will show the incongruity of measures poses much smaller obstacles in the efforts to "integrate"

 different systems.

 when more essentials and/or methods were added to the collection. As well known,

 it is prohibitively time-consuming to construct a trigonometric table afresh.34 It

 is no surprise that the Jesuits involved in the calendar reform in 1630s did not

 construct a trigonometric table afresh and opted to translate and simplify an exist
 ing table. As we will see below that “plagiarizing” or modifying an existing
 table becomes the norm for most of the tables that appear in Qing China. Only
 after more advanced algorithms such as one calculating the sine length of the
 one-fifth of an arc became available did a table constructed anew became more

 plausible.

 3 The first logarithmic trigonometric tables in China

 The Table of Eight Lines in the Chongzhen Astronomical Compendium，in which the

 cosmological model was Tychonic, was introduced by the Jesuits at the court while

 the first logarithmic trigonometric table was introduced into China by a Jesuit far away

 from Beijing, Nicolas Smogulecki, who criticized the Tychonic system and offered

 an ambiguously alternative,35 with the aid from his Chinese disciple and collabora

 tor Xue Fengzuo. Bili sixian xinbiao 比例四線新表（The New Logarithmic Table of

 Four Lines, hereafter the Table of Four Lines), part of Xue's voluminous collectanea

 Lixue huitong 曆學會通（An Integration of Calendric Studies), is the very first loga

 rithmic trigonometric table in China.36 In its preface dated 1662, Xue stated that the

 logarithmic approach could transform the troublesome multiplication/division into

 addition/subtraction and therefore expedite the necessary computations in calendar

 making.37 The implication is clear that this new table is an improvement over the one

 previously introduced (i.e., the Table of Eight Lines).

 The Table of Four Lines consists, as its title indicates, of values for four trigonomet

 ric lines: sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent, with the measures of the arcs ranging

 from 0° to 45°，with a 1-fen 分（[Chinese] minute = 0.01°) increment. Once again, the

 34 Georg Joachim Rhaeticus (1514-1576) spent 12 years constructing a trigonometric table, but did not
 succeed. His disciple Valentinus Otto (1550-1605) finished his work and published it in 1596, cited from
 Chu (1999).

 35 Smogulecki was heavily influenced by the Copernican astronomer Philippe van Lansberge (1561-1632).

 In fact, Smogulecki adapted Lansberge's astronomy to China, characterizing its Chinese version as zhenyuan

 眞原（true principles) against the Chinese version of Tychonic astronomy contained in the Chongzhen
 Astronomical Compendium. The competing astronomical systems in mid-seventeenth-century China are
 quite numerous and complex. According to Xue, there are the Old Chinese Method, the New Chinese

 Method, the Chinese-Islamic System from the Western Areas, the Current Western Method, and the New

 Western Method, the last being one introduced by Smogulecki. Xue's intention was to achieve "integration"

 of all these systems. For Xue's career as an astronomer after he met Smogulecki and brief discussion on

 these systems, see Shi (2007,68-70).

 36 The term bili 比例literally means proportionality, but Smogulecki and Xue used it to differentiate their

 logarithmic trigonometric table from the regular Table of Eight lines. For the introduction of logarithmic
 tables into China, see Han (1992,110-111).

 37 The text reads, “對数者，苦(若)乘除之煩，變為加減，用之作曆省易無訛者也.’’ (The logarithm

 『approach canl transform the troublesome multiplication and division into addition and subtraction; [when]

 applied in calendar-making, [it is] simplistic and easy without errors. See Smogulecki and Xue (1662，
 6:638).

 format of the table allows the values for arcs in the range between 45° and 90o to be

 read from the same table. Xue states that in order to improve the old [Western] method
 (i.e., the one introduced in Grand Measure) and achieve integration of the Western
 and Chinese methods, the Table of Four lines changes the measuring system slightly,
 from 1° equal to 60 min to 1° equal to 100 fen.^ The entries in the table have seven
 digits. Figure 3 is the right leaf of the page 13 from the Table of Four Lines?9 The
 entries in the top row from the right to the left are: 6 (degrees), sine line, cosine line,

 tangent, and cotangent.40 In the first column, the measures of the arcs are from 1 fen

 to 30 fen and in the last column, the measures of arcs from (83°) 99 fen to 10 fen in a

 descending order. The way the numerical digits should be read is the same as in the
 Table of Eight Lines.

 One possible European source for the Table of Four Lines is A. Vlacq's 1628
 logarithmic trigonometric table, Canon Triangvlorvm, Sive Tabvla Artificialivm, Sin
 num, Tangentium & Secantium. Since Vlacq's table is sexagesimal, additional work
 is needed to convert the entries to Xue's centesimal one. Based on Xue's preface, Shi

 38 See Smogulecki and Xue (1662,6:638). In trachtional Chinese method, one Chinese degree {du) is equal

 to 100 Chinese minutes (fen). Thus, it can be construed as an effort to "integrate" (huitong 會通）the Western
 and Chinese methods that Xue's adopted 360 (Western) degrees as the measure for the full circle and set 1°

 Yunli speculates that Xue worked alone without Smogulecki's guidance or assistance

 to convert the old table of logarithms of the sexagesimal trigonometric lines into the

 new centesimal system and renamed it “new table" (Xinbiao 新表).41

 In the voluminous An Integration ofCalendrical Studies, the construction principles

 can be found in Zhenxian bu 正弦部（the Section of Sine)，in which a process of

 constructing of a table of regular sine lines, not logarithmic, is discussed. Obviously

 a logarithmic trigonometric table cannot be established by applying the construction

 principles for the regular trigonometric lines. Xue did not reconcile or explain the

 disengagement between the table and the construction principles in the treatise. The

 Section of Sine more or less follows the basic pattern of first finding the sine lengths for

 special angles, then establishing certain algorithms that can calculate the sine lengths

 of more angles, and lastly finding the sine of 1°. After criticizing the old "incomplete"

 demonstration in the Table of Eight Lines，the Section on Sine explicitly carries out

 the act of construction and derives an un-tabulated list of 120 sine lengths from 0o to

 90°, with a 15-fen (45-min) increment.42

 The algorithms chiefly used in the Section on Sine are the Pythagorean Theorem

 and the half-arc formula. After the sine values of for 30° and 45° are found, the for

 mer was used repeatedly to find the sine values for 15°, 75°, 7.5°, and 3.75°. Once

 the sine length of 3.75° is obtained, Xue then describes the lengths of sine lines

 of the measures in an arithmetic sequence with the common difference 3.75°, from
 11.25° (=3.75°+ 7.50°) to 90°:

 11.25°, 18.75°, 22.50°, 26.25°, 30。，33.75°, 37.50°, 41.25°, 45°, 48.75°, 52.50°,

 56.25°, 60°，63.75°, 67.50°, 71.25°, 75。，78.75。，82.50°, 86.25°, and90。.

 The sine length of an entry in the list is presented as obtained from the sine lengths

 of the previous entry and 3.75°. Take 18.75° as an example. The text describes the

 procedure as “add another [3.75° to the 15。to] get 18.75°. Apply the aforementioned

 algorithm [to] get the sine [line of 18.75。] 3,214,395.” The confusing part is that no
 algorithm similar to (2-2) in the two simple methods can be found in the treatise.つ

 Interestingly, the sine lengths for these angles can actually be obtained through a half

 arc algorithm and the Pythagorean Theorem. For example, sin(l1.25。）and sin(78.75。）

 are obtained in the following manner: Since 11.25° is one-half of 22.50°, which is

 one-half of 45°, the sine length of which is known, the half-arc algorithm can be

 applied twice to obtain that of 11.25°, and consequently, the sine value of 78.75° can

 be found through Pythagorean Theorem.

 41 See Shi (2007, 111). For the reconstruction of the Table of Four Lines and the claimed European source,
 see Roegel (2011).

 42 TTie text reads, ‘吟舊法割園表久纗行世，而獨於取正弦之法M畧不全.學者求其法而不可得，’’ (Now the

 old methods and trigonometric tables [have] long [been] shining and available to the world, but [certain]

 processes of finding sine [lines] are missing, truncated, and incomplete. Scholars [wanted to] obtain them,
 but could not). See [Smogulecki and Xue, 6:627].

 43 The text read, “再加為—八度七五分，用上法得正弦三ニ一四三九五.” Curiously, "the aforementioned

 algorithm" mentioned in the text can only be either the Pythagorean Theorem or the half-arc formula for
 sines. See Smogulecki and Xue (1662,6:631).

 Trigonometrie tables: explicating their construction... 505

 The Section on Sine then constructed geometric figures to find the sine lengths

 for 36° and 12°.44 By applying the two algorithms repeatedly, the sine values can be

 computed for the following measures, from that of 36°45:

 36°, 54°, 18°, 9°, 4.50°, 2.25°, 72°, 81°, 85.50°, 87.75°, 27°, 13.50°, 6.75°,

 63°, 67.50°, 83.25°, 40.50°, 20.25°, 49.50°, 69.75°, 42.75°, 47.25°, 31.50°,

 15.75°, 58.50°, 74.25°, 38.25°, 51.75°, 24.75°, 65.25°, 29.25°, and 60.75°;

 and from 12°,

 12°, 6°, 3°, 1.50°, 0.75°, 78°, 84°, 87°, 88.50°, 89.25°, 39°, 19.50°, 9.75°, 51°,

 70.50°, 80.25°, 42°, 21°, 10.50°, 5.25°, 48°, 69°, 79.50°, 84.75°, 43.50°, 21.75°,

 46.50°, 69.25°, 44.25°, 45.75°, 25.50°, 12.75°, 64.50°, 77.25°, 35.25°, 54.75°,

 24°, 66°, 34.50°, 17.25°, 55.50°, 72.75°, 39.75°, 50.25°, 23.25°, 66.75°, 32.25°,

 57.75°, 33°, 16.50°, 57°, 73.50°, 8.25°, 81.75°, 27.75°, 62.25°, 28.50°, 14.25,

 61.50°, 75.75°, 36.75°, 53.25°, 30.75°, and59.25°.

 The order of the measures follows a logical pattern. The algorithms used are the half

 arc algorithm and Pythagorean Theorem, as indicated earlier. Starting with 36°, the

 half-arc algorithm can be applied repeated to get the sine lengths for 18°, 9°, 4.50°, and

 2.25°. Next, by performing the Pythagorean Theorem on 18°, 9°, 4.50°, and 2.25°,
 the sine lines of 72°, 81°, 85.50°, and 87.75° can also be found; still the half-arc

 formula to 54°, the sine values for 27°, 13.50°, and 6.75° are obtained. Furthermore,

 Pythagorean Theorem can be performed again to get the sine values of their respective

 complementary arcs. This pattern determines which measures to be included and their

 respective position in the list. With these sine lengths, Xue effectively constructs an
 un-tabulated list of sine values from 0° to 90° with a 0.75° increment.46

 Next, Xue approximates sin(l°) via a geometric figure in which sine line of 1°
 is juxtaposed with the sine lines of 1.50° and 0.75° whose values have been found

 earlier. Xue posits from the figure that the true value of the sine line of 1° is between

 sin(0.75 ) + sin(0 750) _ (o )174528 ancj

 3

 sin(1.50°) - sin(0.75°)

 + sin(0.75°) = (0.) 174520.

 44 The approach to finding the sine line of including the figure is the same as the one used by Ptolemy (90
 CE-168 CE). See Thomas (2000,429-431). This is cited from Dong (2011,60).

 45 The geometric figure for finding 36° and the sine values for the measures in the list from 36° can be

 seen in Smogulecki and Xue (1662, 6:632-633). The geometric figure to find 12° and the sine values for
 the measures from 12° can be seen in Smogulecki and Xue (1662,6:633-634).

 46 Dong Jie tabulates these sine values and considers that Xue has a regular sine table. See Dong (2011,
 190-191).

 Therefore, an approximation of the sine value of 10 is taken to be the average of the two

 numbers, 174,524.47 Applying the half-arc algorithm to this value, Xue obtains the sine

 value of 0.5°; however, sin(0.25°) is found by the rule of three, 0.75°: sin(0.75°) «s

 0.25°: sin(0.25°) 48 The first three quantities are known, and therefore, the fourth can
 be found.

 506 J.-P. J. Chen

 Most of the content of the Section of Sine can be found in the section titled "De

 Frabeica Sinuum (On constructing Sine)" in Simon Stevin's (1548-1620) Hypomne
 mata Mathematica, with the exception of the manner and the order of the measures in

 the list from sin(3.75°) 49 It is worth noting that all the geometric figures for finding
 sine values of special arcs in the Section of Sine are identical to those in De Frabeica
 Sinuum;50 moreover, the manner and order in which the sine values are obtained in the

 lists from sin(36°) and sin(12°) discussed earlier, are evocative of the discussion of

 the same values in Hypomnemata Mathematica. While the sine values in the Section

 of Sine have seven significant digits, the values of in Hypomnemata Mathematica have
 nine digits.

 The disconnectedness between the construction principles and the trigonometric

 table is much more pronounced between the Table of Four Lines and Section of Sine.

 The Section on Sine is placed right before the Table of Four Lines in the compendium

 even though the logarithmic trigonometric table cannot, as emphasized earlier, be con

 structed from the principles discussed in the Section on Sine. Secondly, the reason for

 including the procedure of finding sin(l°) is somewhat dubious. In Grand Measure, the

 approximate value of sine length of 1 ' is given because it is the smallest measure of arcs

 and therefore crucial in constructing a table; however, 1° is not the smallest measure

 in the un-tabulated list, which is 0.75°, nor is it in the logarithmic trigonometric table,

 which is 0.01°. In the discussion of finding the sine length of 0.25°, the rule of three

 is applied to 0.25°, 0.75°, and sin(0.75°), the last of which was obtained independent
 of sin(l°). Consequently, sin(l°) has no crucial role in constructing a trigonometric
 table in Xue's approach (nor does 0.25° for that matter). This observation suggests

 that the Section on Sine probably has more than one European source.

 In spite of the flaws, Xue's efforts to explicitly elucidate a concrete way to construct

 a sine table should be lauded. While the construction principles in Grand Measure

 along with the sine values of special angles and the smallest measure 1' provide an atlas

 47 Dong Jie points out a discrepancy here in the computation: If sin(1.50°) is taken as the previously

 calculated value (0.)261869, then the lesser value sin('-50 )-sin(0.75 ) +sjn(0,75°) becomes (0.)174553.67,

 which is in fact greater than the greater value 174,528. This does not seem a typographic error. See Dong

 Jie (2011,60-61) for a more detailed discussion and figures. Such a discrepancy suggests that these values

 and the discussion of finding sin(l°) might be taken from a source different from the one from which the
 values of other sine lines come.

 48 See Smogulecki and Xue (1662,6:633-634).

 49 While the Section of Sine presents sine values of the measures from the list of sin(3.75°) in the order of

 an arithmetic progression, Hypomnemata Mathematica groups the sine value of a measure with that of its

 complementary arc, followed by the half of the first entry and then its complementary arc, etc. The discussion

 of sin(36°) and the measures in its list can be found in Stevin (1605-1608,7-9), that of sin(3.75°) in Stevin
 (1605-1608, 9), and that of sin(12°) in Stevin (1605-1608,9-11).

 50 The figures in the Section of Sine are identical to those in Stevin (1605-1608, 7-9) except for the labels

 for the points.

 Trigonometric tables: explicating their construction... 507

 for interested scholars to build a trigonometric table, Xue's Section on Sine actually

 leads its readers to tread on a path to an un-tabulated list of sine values. A treatise such

 as this serves an educational purpose by making a difficult process more accessible to
 a broader audience.

 4 The Table of Celestial Arcs

 As the Jesuit-introduced trigonometry became more accessible and accepted to certain

 circles of the educated Chinese, treatises authored by the Chinese on the subject also

 emerged. Next, we will turn to a trigonometric table included in a treatise by an obscure

 scholar with limited impact.51 The importance of such a treatise lies in the fact that

 the author explicitly identifies the pre-Jesuk Chinese "counterpart" to trigonometric

 tables from the West, which in turn helps shed more light on the reason why a true

 “integration’’ of the Chinese and Western methods in astronomical computation at the

 end of Ming dynasty was not and could not have been realized.

 Tianhu xiangxian biao 天弧象限表(the Table of Celestial Arcs [in a] Quadrant,

 hereafter the Table of Celestial Arcs) is a work of Li Zijin 李子金，prefaced in 1683.

 Gao Honglin concludes, based on the fact that Li referred to the Table of Celestial Arcs

 in his Suanfa tongyi 算法通義(Comprehensive Meaning of Computation) published

 in 1673 that the Table of Celestial Arcs or a version of its manuscript must have been

 completed prior to 1673.52

 Li also adopts the practice that one (Western) degree is equal to 100 fen as did

 Xue. The Table of Celestial Arcs consists of the lengths for sine and cosine lines from

 0° to 45。，with a 10-feti (= ôO-increment. The radius of the circle is 100,000, and

 therefore, almost all entries in the table have five or less significant digits. Figure 4

 shows a page from the treatise. The first column from the right lists top down 0
 [degree], 0 \fen],10 \fen], ..till100 \fen] (=1°); the first row, reading from the
 right, 0 (degree), sine, cosine, empty space,1°, sine, cosine, and another empty space,

 where the two empty spaces are headings for arc measures listed in an decreasing

 order, 90° to 89 and 89° to 88, respectively, for the cosine and sine length of the

 complementary arcs. Upon comparison, the values in the Tables of Celestial Arcs are

 identical to those in the Table of Eight Lines for 6’，12’，...，54’ of each degree.53

 Li in fact stated in his preface that his table is simplification of the Table of Eight
 Lines.^

 51 The copy of the Table of Celestial Arcs consulted for this article is the one in the library of the Institute

 of History of Natural Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. It is a hand-copied version donated

 by Li Yan without pagination. According to Gao Honglin, there is only one extant print copy kept by
 the author's (Li Zijin's) descendant in Henan province; see Gao (1993). Due to the fact that the existing

 treatises by scholars well versed in astronomy and mathematic in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries

 hardly referred to this work, I speculate that Li Zijin's trigonometric treatise had limited impact.

 52 See Gao (1993).

 53 Gao (1993) also mentions this fact.

 54 The text reads, ‘夭弧象限表者，乃本西洋之割圆ノ^表，而變通其数，省約其文者也（The Table of
 Celestial Arc is obtained] based on the Table of Eight Lines Dividing the Circle from Western ocean [by]

 The accompanying text in the Table of Celestial Arcs did not discuss its construction

 principles. Prior to listing the values in the table, Li describes various ways of finding

 trigonometric lines provided the values for other trigonometric lines of the same arc

 are given; in addition, Li uses an example of trigonometric lines with concrete lengths

 to illustrate these procedures. Li also states without justification the properties of trian

 gles, equivalent to the modern-day the Law of Sine, the side-angle-side postulate, and
 angle-side-angle postulate. All three were demonstrated with examples with concrete

 lengths or measures for angles.55

 Trigonometry and the eight lines, Li contends, are developed by "Western Confu

 cians (:dn/ 西儒)”56 out of the desire to explore the relation between arcs on a circle and

 their chords while the traditional Chinese methods of licha 差(cubic difference),

 pingcha 平差(square difference), and dingcha 疋差(corrected difference)57 for astro

 expediently changing its numbers and shortening its texts.)" See the preface of Li (1673). Our interpretation

 of "expediently changing its numbers" is that Li adopts the practice that a degree is equal to 100/en.

 Footnote 54 continued

 55 See Li (1673).

 56 That Li used "Western Confucian" to refer to the Jesuits indicates that he was not hostile toward them;

 there is no indication, however, that Li was a Chinese convert to Catholicism. It is not clear whether he had
 direct contacts with the Jesuits.

 57 The translation for licha, pingcha, and dingcha (ting cha in Sivin's book) is taken from Sivin (2009). They

 are the third-order, second-order, and first-order finite difference for a sequence of astronomical measures.

 These differences were used for interpolation in astronomical computation. For the text in Season-Granting

 nomical computation serve the same purpose.58 In short, these pre-Jesuit methods can

 be construed as a Chinese "counterpart" as computational tools in calendar-making.

 At the same time, such a technical detail also shed light on the reason why the com

 putationally powerful trigonometric tables cannot be appropriated piecemeal into the

 Chinese system to expedite complex computations.

 As the computations in the traditional Chinese approach to astronomy are intri

 cately embedded in the form of algorithms that directly manipulate the observed

 data, a practitioner of traditional approach can perform computations following the

 prescription in the algorithms without understanding which line segments might be

 equivalent to trigonometric lines of certain arcs. That is, there is no obvious part in

 the process where certain computations can be replaced by consulting a trigonometric

 table. Consequently, in terms of computation, it is either a wholesale adoption of the

 Jesuit system along with the trigonometric tables or none at all. From this perspective,

 Li's or Xue's adopting the practice "1° being equal to 100 fen" only gives an illusion

 of integration of the Chinese and Western methods.

 5 A thorough explanation and ‘‘proofs” of construction principles

 Lisuan quanshu 曆算全書(Complete Writings on Mathematics and Calendric Astron

 omy, hereafter the Complete Writings), the collectanea of works by one of the most

 prolific scholars well versed in mathematics and astronomy during Qing China (1644
 1911),Mei Wending, was published posthumously in 1723.59 In this collection,

 the construction principles of trigonometric tables are explicated in greater details
 compared to prior treatises on the same subject, while the trigonometric table was

 seemingly and peculiarly ‘‘absent.’’

 In the 1723 printing of the Complete Writings, the table of content indicates that

 a trigonometric table (geyuan baxian zhi biao 割HIノ、線之表，a table of eight lines

 dividing the circle) will be published later (xuchu 縝出);see the first column in Fig. 5a.

 The edition published in 1859, however, does not include a trigonometric table either.

 Moreover, the space in the table of content where the characters of "a trigonometric

 table, one juan” are supposed to be is left blank, while the characters for "published
 later” remain; see the first column in Fig. 5b. According to Kobayashi Tatsuhiko, a

 copy of the 1724 printing of the Complete Writings, including a trigonometric table,

 Footnote 57 continued

 calendar system that describes how these differences were used and Sivin's interpretation, see Sivin (2009,
 414-416).
 兌The text reads,"古人但以立差平差定差三率…其法與弧背求弦之數暗相符合
 ([The] ancients only used the three quantities, the cubic difference, square difference, and corrected differ

 ence, these [three] methods implicitly match the numbers of finding [the length of] the chord from [the
 measure of] the arc." See Li (1673, preface).

 59 Current studies of Mei Wending、works are mostly based on individual treatises in Complete Writings.

 For the scope of Mei's works, see Yan (1989). For the studies on various treatises in Complete Writings，
 see Footnote 3 in Jami (2012,25).

 Fig. 5 a The Table of Content in the 1723 edition, b The Table of Content in the 1859 edition

 is extant in Japan. Upon comparison, that trigonometric table is identical to the Table

 of Eight Lines discussed earlier.60

 The construction principles in the Complete Writings are explained in Jie baxian

 geyuan zhi gen 解八線割圓之根(Explicating the Origin of [how] Eight Lines Divides
 the Circle, hereafter Explicating the Origin). Compared to the explanation in earlier
 works, the elucidation can qualify as either explicit geometric constructions or proofs
 for desired properties. The existing evidence shows that Explicating the Origin was
 composed by Yang Zuomei although Mei had an unpublished manuscript that might
 or might not have been its basis.61 Explicating the Origin singles out the insufncient
 explanation of construction principles in Grana Measure and Xue's Section of Sine as

 one of the reasons for its composition.0“ Its title rightfully and adequately reflects its

 purpose.

 60 An extant Japanese translation of the Complete Writings was based on the 1724 printing. See Kobayashi
 (2003, 255-262). According to Feng Lishen, the trigonometric table in the 1724 printing is identical to the
 Table of Eight Lines. See Feng (2009, 177-186).

 61 In Mei's records and notes of his own treatises and manuscripts, there is an entry of a manuscript

 titled Zhengxian jianfa bu 正弦簡法補（Supplement to the Simple Methods of Sine); see Mei (1703, 47b
 48a). Explicating the Origin, however, is not listed among the manuscripts. In the table of content of the

 1724 printing, it is indicated that Explicating the Origin was written by Yang Zuomei (Yang zuo 楊作，
 composed by Yang); see Kobayashi (2003,255). The front page of the treatise also indicates that Complete

 Writings was edited and supplemented (ding bu 訂補）by Yang. Mei Wending's grandson Mei Juecheng
 was not satisfied with Complete Writings and composed a manuscript documenting the numerous errors
 and criticizing the inept choice of the title. In particular, Mei Juecheng emphasized that Explicating the
 Origin was not a work of his grandfather and it should not have been included in the collection; see Mei
 (1739). I thank Professor Han Qi for this piece of evidence.

 62 According to Explicating the Origin, Grand Measure did not provide the construction of the inscribed
 pentagon and decagon, and Xue Fengzuo's Section of Sine provided the algorithms without any furthering

 and illumination (faming 發明).Grand Measure refers to Book 13 of Euclid's Elements for the construction
 for those two regular polygons; however, Book 13 was not translated into Chinese. To be fair, Xue did
 provide certain explanation to the computation. See Yang (1723, lb) for the criticism.

 Trigonometric tables: explicating their construction.ぃ 511

 The sequential presentation of the material in Explicating the Origin roughly fol
 lows that in Grand Measure, the sine values of special arcs are constructed and

 calculated first, followed then by the discussions and ‘‘proofs’’ of the algorithms for

 computing the general sine values from those of the special arcs. The first six inscribed

 regular polygons constructed in Explicating the Origin are exactly the “six essentials

 (liuzong)9' in Grand Measure; the treatise makes an effort to provide geometric con

 struction before computing the length of the side for each of the inscribed regular

 polygons. In addition, Explicating the Origin also provides the construction of an
 inscribed regular nonagon (nine-sided) as well as the calculation of chord length of

 an arc of 40°. Even though a crucial step is absent in the provided construction, the
 calculation of the chord of 40° is nevertheless accurate with the aid of the value of

 sin(l°) and some algorithms which appear later in the treatise.63 The lengths of the

 sides of these inscribed regular polygons are called in the treatise as biaogen

 (origin of the table).

 Along with the sine lengths of 30°, 45°，60。，18。，36°，12。，and 20° (from the sides

 of the 7 inscribed regular polygons), Explicating the Origin also describes two ways

 of finding the value of sin(l°). The first approach is the one employed by Xue in the

 Section of Sine; consequently, the value of sin(l°) obtained is exactly as in Xue's,

 174,524. The other utilizes the rule of three to find an approximated value of sin(15’）

 436,326, based on the proportional relation of the sine lines for 22’30’ and

 as in Grand Measure. Then, the algorithm to find the sine of the sum of two arcs is

 applied to the sine and cosine lines of 45' and 15' to get sin(l°) as 1,745,236,145. It

 was commented in the treatise that this value is comparable to Xue's but seems more
 accurate.64

 The seven methods to find general sine and cosine values are described in Expli

 cating the Origin as "methods of constructing the table" (zuobiao zhifa 做表之法).65

 The Method Three is identical to the equation (2-1)，describing the equality of two
 expressions. The Method Seven is a special case of Ptolemy's Theorem, in which
 one side of the inscribed quadrilateral is a diameter of the circle: If four of the three

 sides and two diagonals are known, the length of the last side can be found. The rest

 of the methods are actually algorithms. We summarize and contrast them with their

 counterparts in Grand Measure in Table 4.

 63 The missing step is concerned with the construction of a line segment by connecting a point with another

 point of an already-constructed line segment. The prescription did not specify which point on the segment

 should be chosen and seemingly implied that the choice should not matter, which proves to be to the contrary

 in later construction. Assuming the construction of a regular nonagon, however, the length of its side can

 be calculated correctly, by applying Pythagorean Theorem to the length of a side of a regular decagon and

 the value of r sin(l°), which the treatise provides much later. See Yang (1723,15a—17b).

 64 The value of sin(45') is obtained following Xue's approach to sin(l°). Pythagorean Theorem is then

 applied to find cos (45'). The treatise commented that the proportionality of the arcs and the corresponding

 sine lines holds for arcs smaller than 20' and that even though there are discrepancies in the proportionality

 computation, they cannot be detected by [current] computational method. See Yang (1723,18).

 65 Technically, there are more than seven algorithms. For example, the first method contains algorithms of
 finding, given the sine value of an arc, the cosine of the same arc, and the sine and cosine of its half-arc.
 See Yang (1723, 20a).

 In discussing these methods, the explanation amounts to providing “proofs’’
 although it does not stress establishing the validity of the methods.66 The geomet

 ric figures and the proof for M-6 [or (2-2) in Grand Measure] are elucidated in detail

 in Explicating the Origin，’

 No trigonometric table was produced following Explicating the Origin，and the

 table included in the 1724 printing was the same as the Table of Eight Lines. These

 observations reinforce our perception of disengagement between the principles of

 construction and the actual acts of construction. The situation will change, however, for

 the next two trigonometric tables, which were amended or constructed anew following

 the discussion of additional properties in the construction principles.

 6 IHgonometric tables imperially composed

 Yiizhi shuli jingyun 御製数理精蘊（the Essence of Numbers and Their Principles
 Imperial Composed, hereafter Numbers and Principles) was among the numerous edi

 torial projects taken by the court following Kangxi Emperor's (1654-1722) decrees

 toward the end of his reign.68 Printed a few months before Kangxi、death in 1722,

 this compendium was the "final outcome of Kangxi's lifelong pursue of mathemat

 66 The text mistakenly describes Method Four as among those in Grand Measure although there is no direct

 counterpart for Method Four. See Yang (1723, 23b). Method Seven is also in Grand Measure, but not as

 part of construction principles of trigonometric tables; see Schreck (1631，1178).

 67 Upon comparison, the figures and explanation for Method Six in Explicating the Origin are identical to

 those in Wang Xichan's Yuanjie 園解（The Circle Explicated). See Dong Jie (2011,145).

 68 For a description of the general editorial projects following Kangxi's decree, see Jami (2012,267-280).

 Yuzhi liili yuanyuan 御製律靥淵源(Origins of Pitch Pipes and the Calendar Imperial Composed) is the

 result of the project on mathematics, astronomy, and music; Numbers and Principles is one of the three

 parts. The other two are Lixiang kaocheng 靥象考成(Thorough Investigation of Astronomical Phenomena)

 and Lii lu zhengyi 律呂正義(Correct Interpretation of the [standard] Pitch Pipes). For the description of the

 compilation of Numbers and Principles and its related personnel and offices, see Han (1992, 1999, 2014,
 2015).

 ics.”69 It contains almost all things mathematical known in early eighteenth-century

 China,70 including a trigonometric table and its principles of construction. Backed by

 the resources at the court, the trigonometric table in the Numbers and Principles has a

 10-s increment, the smallest among the extant tables before 1800 in China. The values

 in the trigonometric tables in Numbers and Principles render the radius of the circle
 to be 10,000,000. The table contains the lengths of six trigonometric lines from 0° to

 45°. Figure 6 shows the upper half of the first page of the trigonometric table.71

 Reading from right to left, the headings in the top row of Fig. 6 are, 0°, sine, tangent
 line, secant line, second (and) minute. The characters for “second” and “minute” are in

 the same register. It is worth pointing out that the numerical values in the table should

 be read from left to right, contrary to that in the Table of Eight Lines, from right to

 left. For example, the value of sin(4’)，the last entry in the column of sine (the second

 column) in Fig. 6, is 一一六ニノ、' (one one six three six from left to right), same as
 in the modern form while the entry recorded in the Table of Eight Lines for sin (4’）is

 六一一(six one one from left to right) although it means 116 in the modern form. It is

 69 The general belief used to be that Numbers and Principles was completed and published in 1723. Based
 on a memorial to Kangxi Emperor, Han Qi concludes that bronze movable type edition of Numbers and
 Principles was printed in 1722 prior to Kangxi's death. Private communication with Han Qi. For certain
 editions of Numbers and Principles, see Fan (1999). The quote is taken from Jami (2012, 8).

 70 One exception is the subject of symbolic algebra. While cossic algebra (Jiegenfang 借根方 in Chi

 nese) takes up 6 chapters (juan 卷）in Numbers and Principles, symbolic algebra (Aerrebala xin fa
 阿爾熱巴拉新^)) was not included. See Han (1999,2007), and Jami (2012,294-304). For a detailed discus
 sion of the construction oiNumbers and Principles, see Han (1991) and Jami (2012,315-384); in particular,
 for the list of subjects contained in the compendium; see Jami (2012, 317-319).

 71 See Shuli jingyun biao (baxian biao 1:1a). The trigonometric table, logarithmic trigonometric table,

 and logarithmic table in Numbers and Principles are grouped together in Shuli jingyuan biao,數理精蘊表
 (Tables in the Essence of Numbers and Their Principles). In this section for tables, certain explanatory texts

 are also included. Placed before the trigonometric table, Baxian biaoshuo ノ、線表說(Discussions of the
 Table of Eight Lines) has its own pagination separated from that of the table. For the discussion of the tables
 in Numbers and Principles, see Han (2014).

 not clear when, how, and why the new way of recording numerical values horizontally
 occurred.

 The trigonometric table in Numbers and Principles is not a direct translation from a

 European source. The texts preceding the table describe that an old table from the West
 has the radius 100,000 while a new table has the radius 10,000,000 and the values are

 listed to the minute.72 Moreover, due to the fact that the interpolated approximation

 values for tangent and secant lines are not “precise” (mihe 密合)for arcs greater than

 60°, it explains, the compilers use certain methods to find the trigonometric values

 for every 10 s.73 It is worth noting that this is the only instance of texts we know in

 which the precision of the values in the trigonometric table is described as an issue.

 It is not clear whether such a statement was made based on experiential evidences.74

 The construction principles are mainly for obtaining values for sine and cosine lines;

 other trigonometric lines are obtained through the basic relations between sine/cosine
 lines and others.

 The task of amending a trigonometric table is a considerable feat in itself. The

 number of entries is 2700 (=45 x 60) in the original table with a 1-min increment;
 to amend such a table, additional 13,500 (= 45 x 60 x 5) entries should be added
 to obtain the desired 10-s increment. Without the resources at the court, such a task

 might take years to complete by any individual.

 The sixteenth chapter (juan 卷）of the second part of Numbers and Principles deals

 with topics that fall under “division of the circle (geyuan 害!]圓),’’75 among which are the

 definitions of the eight lines {geyuan baxian IB ノ、線)，the construction principles of

 trigonometric tables (i.e., liuzong sanyao, erjianfa, the same terms in Grand Measure),

 the fundamental relations between trigonometric lines {baxian xiangqiu ノ、線相求)，

 72 It is possible that the old table from the West refers to the Table of Eight Lines. Several trigonometric tables

 were made for Kangxi Emperor's personal use: a table of sine, tangent, and secant lines and the logarithmic

 values of sine and tangent lines in Shubiao 数表(Numerical Tables), and a table of the logarithmic values of

 the sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent lines in Dushubiao 度奴表（Tables of Degrees and Numbers), and

 a table of sine, tangent, and secant lines in the Yuzhi shubiao jingxiang 御製数表精詳（Essential Details of

 Numerical Tables Imperially Composed). Upon comparison, the values in the trigonometric table in Details

 of Numerical Tables are the same as those in the regular trigonometric table in the Numerical Tables，which

 uses 100,000 as the radius. They are different from the Table of Eight Lines. It is not known whether these
 tables were translated or constructed from scratch. For discussions, see Han (1991, 1997). Jami (2012,309)

 also has a short discussion on Details of Numerical Tables. For these tables, see Shubiao (2000), Dushubiao,

 and Yiizhi shubiao jingxiang (2000). I thank Professor Han Qi for showing me the former two tables.

 73 The text reads, “西洋舊表設半徑為十萬…又有新表股半徑為一千萬，逐分列表.用中比例以求秒数只可用於
 正弦餘弦.若切鎳割線至六十度以後...用中比例尚不能密合，又用本法細推毎十秒.通析求零秒則用比例所差無多” See Shuli

 jingyun biao (baxian biao shuo 1:1a). I have not been able to identify the source of the “new table" although

 it might be one brought by the French Jesuits to China in 1690s.

 74 The less-accurate nature for the tangent and secant values for arcs closer to 90° is expected. These values

 are obtained by dividing sine values or the radius with the cosine values. When the measure of the arc is
 closer to 90°, the values for cosine lines are closer to 0. Consequently, any small discrepancy in cosine is

 magnified tremendously in the tangent and secant lengths.

 75 Two juan discusses the knowledge that fall under "division of the circle," the fifteenth and sixteenth

 juan of Part II of Numbers and Principles. The fifteenth discusses the methods found in traditional Chinese
 mathematics (Yiizhi shuli jingyun, 3:526-544), while the methods in the sixteenth are considered Western

 {Yiizhi shuli jingyun, 3:545-565).

 and the prescriptions of finding the trigonometric lines for (all) arcs in a quadrant (qiu

 xiangxiannei gexian zongfa 求象限内各線總法).The definition of the trigonometric
 lines is broadened to include obtuse arcs, whose measures are between 90° and 180°.

 The eight trigonometric lines for obtuse arcs are in effect the ones for their supple

 mentary arcs. Emphasis is again placed on the sine line, the text explains, since other

 lines are derived from sine lines (zhuxian jie youci ersheng 諸線皆由此而生).It is

 no surprise that the values of special arcs and the algorithms are geared toward finding

 the lengths of the sine lines.

 To introduce new algorithms into the construction principles, Numbers and Princi

 ples first points at a flaw in Grand Measure as a segue: (certain) sine lengths for as small

 as 45 min can be obtained through the algorithms, yet for arcs less than 45 min, their

 trigonometric lengths need to be obtained through approximation (bilifa 比例法，the

 rule of three). To remedy this situation, Numbers and Principles then introduces two

 algorithms described as yishi guichu 益责歸除法(the method of augmenting dividend

 and dividing numbers), to be described below. These algorithms prescribe procedures

 to solve problems equivalent to finding a positive root of a particular type of polyno

 mials of third degree. Two important applications are to find the lengths of the sides of

 an inscribed regular tetradecagon (fourteen-sided) and octadecagon (eighteen-sided),

 and consequently, the lengths of the sides of inscribed regular nonagon and heptagon
 (seven-sided) can be found as well. Moreover, the one-third arc formula that finds the

 sine value of one-third of the arc given the sine value of the arc can also be derived

 with the same yishi guichu algorithm. In short, this particular algorithm can augment

 both the special sine values and the algorithms that generate more sine lengths.

 Numbers and principles elaborates further that with the sine values from these

 additional inscribed regular polygons, one can find three hundred and sixty sine values

 of arcs in a quadrant with a 15-min increment. The value of r sin (5’）can be calculated

 by applying the one-third arc formula to r sin(15/)； consequently, only the sine values

 of one through 4 min need to be obtained through the rule of three.

 Numbers and Principles continues to use “six essentials, three important, and two

 simple methods” to label the construction principles even though there are now ten

 essentials and eight algorithms available. As the purpose of the discussion is to find

 sine values of special arcs, the texts do not include geometric construction of these

 inscribed regular polygons, in contrast to Mei's and Yang's practice in their treatise.

 The two algorithms of yishi guichu method introduced in Numbers and Principles

 are in the form of two similar questions76:

 1.Given four quantities of continued ratio (lian èが，連比例，i.e.，a:b = b:c = c:d)，

 suppose a =10,000 anda + d = 3b，find b，c，and d.

 2. A similar statement with the condition a + d = 3b is replaced by a + d = 2b + c.

 While the yishi guichu method resembles the traditional procedures of extracting

 cubic root with positive lower-degree terms (kai daizong /诉mg，開帶縱立方，equiva

 76 The two questions, the procedures to solve them, and the geometric explanation can be found in Yiizhi
 shuli jingyun (3:556-558, 3:560-573).

 lent to finding a root of certain polynomials of third degree),77 it is in effect influenced

 by Western mathematics. The texts state without elaboration that in a logarithmic

 table of Western method, four quantities in the continued ratio were used to find

 inscribed heptagons and nonagons; the text goes on to say that the idea was expanded

 to devise the methods and find [the side lengths of] an inscribed regular tetradecagon

 and octadecagon.78

 The algorithms discussed in the part of "three important" and "two simple meth
 ods'' in Numbers and Principles are summarized in Table 5. Both the given and

 desired quantities in the algorithms are stated with arcs of concrete measures, and

 their trigonometric values instead of general terms: the explanation, construction, or

 "proof," though formulated with the same numerical values in question, can be applied

 directly to general arcs. Historians of Chinese mathematics in general agree that these

 explanatory texts constitute proofs for these algorithms.

 The algorithm of finding the sine value of the one-third of the arc with a known sine

 length is demonstrated with an example: Given the sine value of 36°, 58,778.5252292,
 find the sine of 12°, one third of 36。.79 The solution: Double sin 36。to get the chord

 of 72°. Then use it to multiple the square of the radius ten thousand as the dividend;

 triple the square of the radius ten thousand as the divider. Apply the [first] yishi guichu

 algorithm to get [the second quantity] 41,582.3381634, which is the chord of 24。.
 One-half of this value, 20,791.1690817, is the sine value of 12。.80 The geometric

 77 For example, in the question where the condition is a d = 3b, it can be deduced that in the modern
 language, the polynomial equation to solve should be ズ3 + (100,000)3 = 3(100,000)2ズ.See Guo and
 Li (2010, 663). In Chinese tradition, finding a solution to a polynomial of the second or third degree is

 considered part of theory of extracting roots, the process of which is considered similar to division and

 consequently shares certain terms in their operations. A discussion of Chinese theories of extracting roots

 would be long-winding and distracting. We refer interested readers to Martzloff (1997,240-268).

 78 The texts read，“爾来，西法對数表内有設連比例四率以求園内容七邊九邊ニ法，因推庚其理…增求園内容

 十八邊十四邊形之士.” See Yiizhi shuli jingyun (3:547).

 79 The decimal expression of the sine length of 36° is described in Numbers and Principles as 58,778 and,

 in smaller characters, "with a small extra" (xiaoyu 小餘）5,252,292. See Yiizhi shuli jingyun (3:569). Other

 decimal values follow the same practice.

 explanation following the procedure also works for any acute angle. Therefore, the

 algorithm of finding the sine of the one-third of an arc is then established.

 The Numbers and Principles does not articulate how a trigonometric table with a

 1-min increment was amended to one with a 10-s increment. One can speculate that the

 first step should be finding the sine length of 10". One way to achieve this goal is to take

 the sine length of the smallest measure 1’ from the table, apply the half-arc formula to

 get the sine value of 30^，and then apply the algorithm to find the sine of one-third arc

 to get the length of sin 10". Once the sine length of the smallest measure is obtained,

 the sum and difference formula for sine and cosine can be applied repeatedly to get
 those sine values with 10" increments between sine values of arcs of consecutive

 minutes. It is evident from our analysis that the augmentation of the trigonometric

 table in Numbers and Principles is directly related to the one-third arc formula for

 sine lines. This is a departure from the previous treatises in which the tables provided

 were simply copied or simplified from existing ones, hence completely separated from

 the principles discussed.

 7 A trigonometric table potentially constructed from scratch

 An Qingqiao's Yvcian biao 一線表(The Table of One Line) might potentially be the

 only extant trigonometric table that was constructed afresh by an individual Chinese

 scholar based on the construction principles available. It can be found in three differ

 ent treatises, Juxian yuanben 矩線原本(Elements of Lines of the Carpenter Square)

 prefaced in 1818, Yixian biao yong 一線表用（Applications of the Table of One Line)

 prefaced in 1817, and Xuesuan cunlue 學算存略（Brief [Notes] of Learning Math
 ematics), with slight variations.81 This table is extremely short with a total of two

 hundred and fifty entries. It has only values for the sine lines, hence the title, Table of

 One Line. Secondly, An's choice of the unit renders the measure of the entire circle to

 be one hundred du 度(degree), each of which is equal to one hundred/<?n 分(minute),

 each of which in turn is equal to one hundred miao 秒(second).82 Such a measuring

 system for arcs stands in stark contrast to the system, 360° for the full circle, used by

 the Jesuits and the majority of the scholars since late Ming, as well as to the traditional

 systems, roughly 365.25 du，used in various Chinese calendar systems prior to the

 Jesuit presence in China.83 Considering that the shape of heaven is circular in Chinese

 81 The sine table in Elements of the Lines of Carpenter Square is titled Geyuan yixian biao 割圆—線表

 (The Table of One Line Dividing the Circle), while the tables in the other two treatises are both titled Yixian

 biao 一線表(The Table of One Line). In Elements of the Lines of the Carpenter Square and Brief Notes

 of Mathematical Learning，the table is one page long while in Applications of the Table of One Line，it is
 a little over three pages. They all nevertheless have 250 entries. See An (1818,12:335; 1817,12:339-341;

 1997,12:595) for the table in the respective treatise. In Brief Notes, An also has a partial tangent table at
 the end.

 82 An's circular unit was considered by Dai Zhen (1724-1777) in composing his Gougu geyuan ji

 句股割園記（Records of Base-Altitude and Circle-Division) but eventually discarded. See Chen (2011)

 for the discussion on Dai's choices of measuring unit for the circle.

 83 Each of the Chinese calendric systems has its own constant for the suishi 歲貪（year numerator), which

 comes from the constant suizhou 歲周（year cycle or year length), the number of days in â year. See Sivin

 Fig. 7 Table of One Line

 Classics, that the sun makes a full circle on the celestial sphere over a course of a

 day, and that one full day has one hundred ke 刻(14.4 min), An's choice of the unit
 effectively establishes the correspondence between the one du of the circle and the

 distance travelled by the sun on the celestial sphere during the period of one ke. In

 short, An's choice of circular arcs results from the convergence of the temporal and
 spatial notions.

 The Table of One Line has values for sine lines from 0 to 25 du (90。）with the

 increment of 10 fen (0.36°). The radius is 100,000.

 Figure 7 is the complete Table of One Line.84 The entries in the first column are 0

 du (chudu 初度)，10 fenf 20 fen …，90 fen and those in the second the sine values for

 the corresponding arcs in the first column. The right leaf contains the entries for arcs

 ranging from 0 du to 12 du 50 fen in the ascending order while the left 25 du to 12 du

 Footnote 83 continued

 (2009, 272-277) for the discussion on the length of the tropic year in various systems. These systems did
 not explicitly use their year length as the measure of the full circle. Chinese scholars in the seventeenth
 and eighteenth century, however, construed these numbers in the ancient systems as the measures of the

 circle used by the ancients. For example, Wang Xichan 王錫闡（1628-1682) in his Xiao,an xinfa 曉庵新法
 (New Methods by Xiao'an [Wang Xichan]) used three different units for measuring the circular arcs, the

 measures for the circle are 360。，384 yaoxian 父限，and 365 and some ridu 日度（sun degree). See Wang
 (1983,459). Dai Zhen in discussing his choice of circular unit explicitly stated 365 plus some du was used
 by the ancients as the measure for the circle. See Dai (2002,129).

 The construction principles accompanying the Table of One Line are described by

 An as taken from both the Chinese and Western methods. Application of the Table

 of One Line only lists two algorithms and directs readers to Elements of Lines of

 the Carpenter Square for details. The explanatory texts before the table discuss the

 construction principles as well. Although Six Essentials, Three Important, and Two

 Simple Methods are not mentioned, the construction more or less follows the similar

 pattern. We summarized An's algorithms for construction in Table 6.85

 Algorithms (1-1) through (1-4) were provided with geometric figures and textual

 explanation, while the rest were simply stated with minimal explication. An describes

 Algorithm (1-1) of finding the sine length of the fifth of an arc as a method from

 Jiegenfang 借恨方(calculation by borrowed root and powers), the version of cossic

 algebra introduced to China by the Jesuits at the end of seventeenth century.86 To
 establish the procedure of the algorithm, An first portrays the sine lines of an arc,
 a, and its one-fifth, on a circle. An then describes in words with the aid of a

 simple geometric figure a process involving geometric reasoning as well as some

 form of “symbolic algebra" manipulation to obtain a relation, equivalent to a fifth

 degree polynomial in which the root is the chord of the one-fifth of the given arc and

 can be found by applying a technique in "calculation by borrowed root and powers.”

 Though deserving careful investigation and explication, the derivation of Algorithm

 (1-1) through geometry and symbolic algebra will prove long-winding and decidedly

 distracting. Therefore, it will be discussed separately in a different article.87

 85 The order of the algorithms in the table is the same as that of appearance in the treatise. See An (1818,
 12:330-334).

 86 For a detailed discussion on cossic algebra and the "calculation by borrowed root and powers" in
 eighteenth-century China, see Han (2003) and Jam! (2012,201-210).

 87 Algorithm (1-1) was also discussed by Wang Lai 汪萊（1768~1813) and Jiao Xun (1763-1820). Jiao

 basically elaborates on Wang's geometric construction, and their derivations of the fifth-degree polynomial

 relation are of purely geometric nature. See Wang (1798,4:1505-1509). An's derivation in algorithm (1-1)

 involves the squares of expressions of fractions and multiplications of fractions in words not numbers with

 Algorithms (1-1) and (1-2) are crucial in the construction of An's sine table due

 to his peculiar choice of 100 du as the arc measure for a full circle. To An, the main

 issue here is to find the sine value for the “smallest” arc,1 miao (=0.00036° or 1.296

 s). To do so, An applies Algorithm (1-1) to the sine of 25 du，the radius (1,000,000),

 to get sine of 5 du; continuing with this process, An obtains the sine values for 1 du,

 20 fen, A fen, and 80 miao and 16 miao. Switching to (1-2), An then acquires the sine

 values for 8, 4, 2,1,and then \ miao. In describing this process, An used the chord

 (tongxian 通弦）instead of the sine line, which is one-half of the chord of the half

 arc. Moreover, An does not provide concrete numerical values for these sine lengths

 except for the chord of one miao, the smallest unit in his system, as 62.831853.88 From

 this value, An concludes the ratio, equivalent to an approximation for the value of n，

 between the diameter and the circumference is: the diameter, twenty million, and the
 circumference, 62,831,853.

 To construct a trigonometric table from scratch is no small feat, especially when

 no institutional support or mechanic computational aid is in place to expedite the

 process. So, did An construct his sine table manually on his own? According to our

 analysis below, it is very likely that the table was constructed independent of previously

 existing ones. Since most measures for the arcs in An's table, e.g.,10 fen = 21'36//,

 do not conform to the 360° system and therefore do not appear in any of other existing

 trigonometric tables, k can be said with certainty that An at least worked out the sine

 values for these measures. Is it possible that An took the sine values of the arc measures

 that do appear in early tables, e.g., 50 fen =1°48/ to form some kind of grid and then

 computed the rest? By comparing these values in the Table of One Line with those in

 the Table of Eight Lines and in Numbers and Principles Table，we concluded that this

 is highly unlikely.

 Fifty arc measures in An's Table of One Line also appear in the previously analyzed

 tables. These measures form an arithmetic sequence starting at 50 fen (=1。48’），with

 an increment in the same measure. When compared to the sine values of those in the

 Table of Eight Lines，which uses the same radius, seven out of fifty have different sine

 lengths. Granted the discrepancy is in the last digit, a rate of 14% seems to be very

 high, considering that the task was merely to copy the values. Had the sine values

 been taken from Numbers and Principles，where the radius of the circle is ten million,

 certain rounding should have been applied. Whatever rounding system was used，the

 rate of discrepancy is at least 12 %.89 With these high discrepancy rates and the singular

 measuring system, we argue that it is highly unlikely that An took these values from

 the existing tables or any other source. It is rather difficult to comment on whether

 Footnote 87 continued

 other expressions. Existing evidences and current scholarships seem to suggest that the discussion of algo

 rithm (1-1) originated from Ming Antu, to be discussed below.

 沾 An's description for this value is, six two with small extra (xiaoyii 小餘)eight three one eight five three,

 similar to the usage in Shuli jingyun. The discussion on the process of finding the chord of one miao and
 the rest can be seen in An (1818,12:332).

 89 It is not very clear how these values were rounded or if such a system was in place. The system that

 produces the fewest discrepancies is to round up when the rounding digit is 6 or more and to round down
 otherwise. The measures that do not conform to this system are 45°, 57°36', 61。12’，64°48/, 68°24/, and
 77024:

 An had any collaborator, foreign or Chinese, because little is known about An's life.

 Based on the evidence presented, we posit that the Table of One Line was probably

 constructed afresh by An Qingqiao independently, heavily relying on the algorithms

 of finding the sine values of one-fifth and one-half of an arc.

 8 Reflection on construction principles and “accuracy” of the table

 The system of construction principles codified in Six Essentials, Three Important，and

 Two Simple Methods consists of trigonometric values of certain special arcs and two

 kinds of algorithms. The first kind will generate more trigonometric values from the

 known values to populate the table, and the second kind helps obtain the trigonometric

 lengths of the "smallest" arc in the table. In particular, the algorithms that find the sine
 values of and where the sine and cosine values of a have already been
 obtained, serve both capacities. The algorithm equivalent to sin(a + b)9 e.g., (2-2)

 in Grand Measure，is the main tool to populate a trigonometric table. To find the

 sine value of the "smallest" arc in the table, the rule of three was employed to obtain

 its approximation. Only after the algorithms equivalent to finding sin(号)，sin(|), and

 sin(|) were developed, the sine value of the smallest arc in the table could be obtained
 independent of the application of the rule of three. Whether the system is sexagesimal

 or centesimal, one can obtain the values of r sin(l’)，r sin(l") or the sine length of 1

 miao by applying these three algorithms to the sine length of the special arc 60° (or

 45°, 12.5 du in An's case) since only 2,3, and 5 appear in the integer factorization of

 60 and 100. In particular, the approximation by the rule of three is not needed.

 To create a trigonometric table “better’，than an existing one, one could in principle

 improve the precision of the values of the entries in the table in two different ways. The

 first one is to make the increment in the table smaller; or â greater radius of the circle

 is used, which amounts to providing more accurate significant digits. Both approaches
 are rather prohibitive for individuals without resources due to the tremendous amount

 of computation involved. In the direct applications of the table in aiding calculation,

 there should be another issue of how accurate the entries are in the table. The reality is,
 most Chinese authors treating trigonometric tables did not seem concerned with this

 issue, judging from the absence of discussion in their treatises.90 Whether this was

 because the level of accuracy of entries in the table provided more than satisfied the
 need of computation in application or whether the authors did not consider the issue

 worthy requires further investigation. Just when one might naively conclude that the

 construction principles had reached the zenith in China when the algorithm of find

 ing sin(|) was developed, and therefore, no enhancement of construction principles

 should be proposed or needed, a brand new approach to constructing trigonometric

 tables began to emerge in the early nineteenth century.

 如 As discussed earlier, the particular texts in Numbers and Principles are the only extant record that
 explicitly mentions the imprecision of the values of tangent and secant lines when the measures of the
 angles are close to 90°.

 9 A Revolution of Construction Principles of Trigonometric Table

 This revolutionary approach produces algorithms similar to calculating finite sums

 in the series expansion of trigonometric functions; consequently, many historians of

 Chinese mathematics characterize it as achievements of power series in China. Such a

 characterization is somewhat misleading because it imposes the observer's view over

 the actor's. It should be emphasized that these algorithms produced from this approach

 were for the most part considered by the Chinese scholars in the eighteenth and nine

 teenth century as an alternative and quick way to find the trigonometric lengths of

 given arcs; in other words, they are better tools in construction of trigonometric tables.

 Before 1819, circulated among certain milieu of scholars well versed in mathemat

 ics were manuscripts of algorithms, including one that finds the sine length directly

 from the measure of the arc. Though other names were also associated with the man

 uscripts, historians of Chinese mathematics generally agree that these manuscripts

 were abridged copies ofMinggantu's or Ming Antu's 明安圇 work.91 The importance

 of these algorithms, above all, is that they are for general arcs, not merely for arcs

 of special measures. They amount to, in the modern mathematical language, calcu

 lating a finite sum of the power-series expansion of sine and inverse sine functions.92

 This revolutionary approach to finding trigonometric values of an arbitrary arc decid

 edly upends the traditional construction principles of trigonometric tables pioneered

 in China by the Jesuits, and later studied and perfected by generations of Chinese

 scholars. Though they emerged in the early nineteenth century, the story of these

 “power-series” algorithms started earlier in the eighteenth century.

 The extant record of the earliest appearance of this type of algorithms is the treatise,

 Chishuiyizhen 赤水遺珍(The Pearls Recovered from the Red River) by Mei Juecheng

 栂毀成（1681-1764)，the oldest grandson of Mei Wending and one of editors and

 compilers of Numbers and Principles (Yiizhi shuli jingyun). We summarize all three

 algorithms here in Table 7.

 In his treatise, Mei Juecheng compares these algorithms with the traditional circle

 division methods, emphasizes the surprising efficiency of these three algorithms, and

 consequently names them "quick method” (jiefa 捷法).93 He also indicates that these

 91 The numbers of the manuscripts and versions are not clear. What was clear is that these manuscripts

 did not include diagrams or explanatory texts. As a result, initially the readers of these manuscripts did not

 know how these algorithms were established. Several scholars in the nineteenth century worked to derive

 and expand the results.

 92 These algorithms demonstrate examples of finite sums of the series; see accounts in Martzloff (1997,
 353-361), Li and Du (1987, 234-240) and Guo and Li (2010, 730-735). In Ming Antu's treatise on

 this topic (discussed below), it was said that "if... adding these terms ... indefinitely (wuqiong,無窝)，

 [one] can get a more accurate value (mishu 密數)[of the value of trigonometric function]." See Ming
 (1839, 6). The scholarship in Chinese on this topic is too numerous to be listed here. See for example
 Luo (1988, 1990), and Tegus (1996) to name a few. Jami offers a comprehensive study of this subject in
 French; see Jami (1990).

 93 Thetextreads，“割圔舊術…至精至密...但開数十位之方，非旬日不能辦.今以圆内六等邊別立乘除之數以求

 quick methods of finding the [accurate values of] circumference, sine [length], and

 [that of the] sagitta are translation of old methods by a Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jartoux

 (1669-1720) or Du Demei 杜德美 his Chinese name.94 The algorithms were presented

 using concrete examples, not stated as general procedures;95 more importantly, no

 proof or explanation of their derivation was provided either by Mei Juecheng or by

 Jartoux. No existing evidence shows that Mei Juecheng did any further study on the

 quick methods of "power-series" algorithms.

 The treatises treating this topic in the nineteenth century started with Ming Antu, a

 colleague of Mei Juecheng at the court.96 Ming's treatise, Geyuan milii jiefa (Quick

 Methods for the Circle's Division and Precise Lu), formerly published in 1839, lists

 thirteen algorithms with the first three being those in Mei's treatise and the last four

 as corollaries of the first nine.97 Chinese scholars in the nineteenth century believed

 that Ming learned of the first three from Jartoux and developed the rest on his own;

 Footnote 93 continued

 obtained from repeated uses of right triangles. Therefore, they are called quick methods; see Mei (1759,

 25a). Brief as it is, the text suggests that these quick methods were derived based on an inscribed regular

 hexagon and therefore has its origin from the "circle division." It is difficult to determine with certainty

 that Mei had seen the derivation of the algorithms. Had Mei had seen it, Ming Antu, a colleague of Mei and

 the author of the major treatise of this subject, should have had seen it, too. But according to the preface in
 Ming's treatise, he did not know initially how these algorithms were derived. See discussions below.

 94 In a commentary in smaller characters, Mei specifies, “yi xishi Du Demeifa,譯西 士杜德美法(Translating
 the methods [by the] Western scholar, Du Demei [i.e., Pierre Jartoux])"; see Mei (1759,23a).

 つJ The algorithm of finding the circumference is demonstrated with a circle of diameter two billion (ershi

 yi 二十僮）and the others are applied to arcs of and 21。19’51"and 16°27/43//, respectively. See Mei (1759,
 24a, 25b, and 26a).

 96 Both Mei and Ming were students at Kangxi Emperor's Office of Mathematics. For the establishment

 of the Office of Mathematics within the Studio of Cultivating the Young (Mengyang zhai 蒙餐齋)，see Han

 (1999) and also Jami (2012, 268). For the editorial project of Yiizhi liili yuanyuan 御製律靥淵源（Origins

 of Pitch Pipe and Calendar), which includes Numbers and Principles as one of the three parts, Mei and

 Ming both were listed among the personnel involved; see Han (1999). Mei was listed as "comprehensive

 collation (huibian 彙编)’’ and Ming as "Determination and Measure (kaoce 考測)”；see Jami (2012,374).

 The personnel at the Office of Mathematics was first reported by Han Qi in an unpublished presentation
 in 2007, “1713: A Year of Significance," at REHSEIS, CNRS, Paris, January 9,2007. Its file is accessible

 at https://www.academia.edu/8278554. This presentation is significant because it contains many original
 findings, chief among them the comparison of the Chinese Office of Mathematics with the French Académie

 Royale des Sciences. For the conflict between Jesuit Astronomers and the non-Christian literati in relation

 to the compilation project of Origins of Pitch Pipe and Calendar, see Han (2015).

 97 Instead of providing procedures in the last four algorithms, the text explains that by utilizing the basic

 relations between trigonometric lines, the given quantities in the last four algorithms will result in certain

 quantities in some of the previous nine algorithms; therefore, the desired quantity can be found by applying
 one of the 9 previously described algorithms. See Ming (1839,10-11).

 nevertheless, they referred to these algorithms as the nine algorithms of Du (Dushi

 力杜氏九術).We list the results of the additional algorithms developed by Ming
 in Table 8.98 Though the precise sources for the Du's algorithms, (D-l)-(D-3), cannot

 be ascertained, it is generally agreed that these algorithms are of European origin."

 While these algorithms can produce results quickly, the absence of proper notation

 renders the statement of these algorithms cumbersome to the modern readers.100 To

 illustrate the lengthy description of the algorithms, the complete procedures of (D-4),

 which is to find the chord of a given arc, are translated below101:

 The method: Takes the length of an arc as the first item. Use the radius as the first

 lii of lianbili 連比例（continued proportion) and the [length of the] arc as the

 second lii of continued proportion to find the third lii of continued proportion.

 Next, multiply the first item with the third lii and divide [the product] by the first

 lii to get the fourth lii. Divide [the fourth lii] by 4, by 2, and then by 3 to get

 the second item, which is supposed to be subtracted. Write it separately. Next,

 take the second item, multiply [it] with the third lii and divide [the product] by

 the first lii to get the sixth lii. Divide [it] by 4, again by 4, and then by 5 to get

 98 When these algorithms are described in modern notation, some of them seem redundant, e.g., algorithms
 (D-7) and (D-9). It is worth emphasizing that these quantities represent distinct line segments as defined

 in Fig.1.Per Fig.1,the sagitta (shi 矢）of the arc BDH (= 2BD) is the line segment AD, the versed sine

 (zhengshi 正矢)of the arc BD\ the chord (xian 弦）of BDH is the line segment BAH {—2AB = 2 sin(BZ)))

 twice of the sine (zhengxian 正^) of BD. That is, 2 sin (a) is the chord for the arc 2a and vers(ûf) is its

 sagitta.

 99 Even though two manuscripts were mentioned as possible sources for the algorithms, no treatises or

 manuscripts could corroborate with the record. For the discussion on these manuscripts, see Martzloff (1997,

 355), in particular, footnote 10. Jami argues that the Chinese titles of the two manuscripts are simply the

 description of the formula themselves and consequently implies that these manuscripts did not exist; see

 Jami (1990, 44). There is also speculation as whether all nine algorithms were actually given by Jartoux

 and Ming Antu simply copied them. Jami again argued against this possibility. See Jami (1990, 44-45).

 Moreover, Martzloff identifies in the library catalogue at the Pe'Tang Church, one of the Jesuit Residences

 in Beijing in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, six European treatises as related to infinite series. See
 Martzloff (1997,356).

 100 Almost all contemporary scholars treating this subject opt to use the modern mathematical notation

 in their discussion. Martzloff, however, translates the algorithm (D-l) into non-mathematical expressions.
 See Martzloff (1997,355).

 101 See Ming (1839,7) for the Chinese text for the description. A series of numbers A, B, C, Z),and £ ...
 are said to be in the relation of lianbili (continued proportion) if A:B = B:C = C:D = D'.E = .... Any
 number in the relation of continued proportion relation is a lii. See Jami (1990, 73-87) for the discussion

 on how Ming employed continued proportions in explicating his algorithms.

 the third item, which should be written under the first item. Next, take the third

 item, multiply [it] with the third lU，and divide [the product] by the first lii to get

 the eighth lii. Divide [it] by 4, by 6, and then by 7 to get the fourth item, which

 is supposed to be subtracted. Write [the fourth item] under the second item. Add

 the first and third items; add the second and fourth items. Subtract one sum from

 the other to get the value of the chord [of the arc].

 Following the above description, the lii's and numbers in the text are displayed in
 Table 9 with modern mathematical notation:

 Let a be the length of the arc in question and r the radius.

 Therefore, r sin(a) is [more of less] equal to the first item minus the second, plus

 the third, and then minus the fourth, or in the modern notation,

 .,、 ot a〕 a'

 From the description or the above expression, it is clear that the computation of the sine

 length consists of a combination of four basic arithmetic operations; most importantly,

 it is free of time-consuming root extraction, as emphasized in Mei Juecheng's passage.

 With the length of the radius, r，usually being a power of ten, the divisions are relatively

 simple. Consequently, an accurate number of the value can be obtained quickly.

 The derivation of these algorithms is long-winding and will lead us astray from the

 main discussion. A description of the basic idea behind the algorithms instead will be

 given below, using again the algorithm (D-4) as an example. Ming first considers and

 establishes the procedures in which the desired quantities are the chords of arcs whose

 lengths are one-half, one-third, and one-fifth (i.e., | and |) of an arc a whose

 arc length and its chord are known.102 These procedures are all derived through the
 interplay of geometry and algebra.103

 102 The geometric figure used by An Qingqiao on his algorithm (1-1) is very similar to the one in Ming's
 treatise regarding the algorithm that finds the chord of the one-fifth arc. It is not clear whether An had seen

 Ming's manuscript.

 103 Ming makes it clear that the chord of | can be found rather easily by applying the old method of
 right triangles, but this old approach cannot be generalized to other arcs. Ming in fact provides three different

 First, Ming forms a sequence of similar isosceles triangles, in which the base of one

 triangle is the side of the next. For any two consecutive triangle, the proportionality
 relation holds:

 526 J.-P. J. Chen

 S:B = s:b,

 where S and B are the side and the base of one triangle in the pair, and s and b those

 of the next; more importantly, B = s. Furthermore, geometric construction makes

 it possible to compare the chord of a, the given quantity, and that of where k is

 an integer. An expression involving both chords are then obtained. Once the three
 cases of and | are established, Ming utilizes the procedures of | and | to
 construct those for the length of the chord for based on the fact that 2x5 =10;

 afterward, the algorithms of finding the chords of one-hundredth, one-thousandth, and

 ten-thousandth of a arc can also be established similarly.

 A pattern emerges in computing the chords of and this pattern allows Ming to

 determine the numbers to be used as divisors in each step of finding the next item.

 For example, the numbers in the denominator of the second term in the three cases of

 WÔ9 and ioo^ooo 咖 24.0024, 24.000024, and 24.00000024, respectively. Ming
 argues that those small extras beyond 24 come from the fact that in computation, the

 chord of the arc is used instead of the arc itself. As the discrepancy between the chord

 and the arc diminishes as the arc becomes smaller, he claims that the precise number 24

 will be achieved when the chord is replaced by the actual length of the arc, with 24 being

 the product of 4 times 2 time 3 in the denominator of the second item in Table 9.104

 Ming thus goes through the steps and uses the pattern established from these cases to

 determine the numbers that should be employed to divide a lii to obtain an item.105

 Similar to Ming, Dong Youcheng 童祐誠（179レ1823) also discussed the sine and
 versed sine lines in his treatise. Dong, who in 1819, read an abridged, hand-copied

 version of Ming's algorithms without proofs or diagrams,106 established algorithms

 similar to Ming's in his treatise, Geyuan lianbili shu tujie 割圓連比例術圖解（The

 Explication with Diagrams of Continued proportions in the Circle Division). Published
 in 1830, almost a decade ahead of Ming's, Dong's treatise contributes to a wider
 circulation of these algorithms and connects these algorithms and their derivation

 in the continued proportions from similar isosceles triangles with another branch of

 Chinese mathematics, duiduo shu 堆操術 or duoji shu 燥積術（Methods of Piles),

 ways to derive the chord of ,. The three methods in the texts in Ming's treatise can be seen, respectively, in
 Ming (1839,21-26,26-29, and 29-31); for Jami's comparison of the third method with Newton's approach;
 see Jami (1990,125-140).

 104 These calculated numbers are described respectively on 49b, 50a, and 50b of Ming's treatises; see Ming
 (1839,44-45) and also see Jami (1990,152-156) for more discussions.

 105 See Ming (1839,44-49).

 106 In Dong's own preface dated 1819, it is described that Zhu Hong 朱鸿（1802 civil examination 力

 進士 degree) showed to Dong the nine algorithms [copied] by Zhang Zhiguan 張豸冠（early nineteenth

 century). See Dong (1830,435). The manuscript of the algorithms did not have any diagram or explanation

 with them. Independently of Ming's approach, Dong found ways to derive the algorithms. See Tegus (1996,
 322-324).

 which is similar to the topic of finding recursive relations in sequences of positive

 integers.107

 Neither of Ming's and Dong's treatise discusses other trigonometric lines. The

 treatment of tangent and secant lines can be found in Xu Youren's 徐有壬（1800

 1860) Ceyuan milii 測圓密率（Measuring Circle and Its Precise Lii) composed prior

 to 1840,108 Li Shanlan's 李善蘭（1811-1882) Hushi qimi 弧矢啟密（Opening the

 Secrete of Arcs and Sagitta) composed in 1845,109 Xiang Mingda's 項名達（1789

 1850) Xiangshu yiyuan 象數一原(Images and numbers [are] of one origin), prefaced

 in 1843 and 1849,110 andDaiXu's 戴煦（1806^1860) •扣冊7な外切密率(Tangent
 outside [the Circle] and the Precise Hi) composed in 1852.111 These treatises each have

 its own particular approach and topics other than ‘‘power-series” algorithms. To focus

 our discussion on construction of trigonometric tables, we only list related algorithms
 in these treatises in Table 10.112

 From the table and the dates of composition for these treatises, it is clear that by

 early 1850s, Chinese scholars were able to find the lengths of the trigonometric lines

 of an arc and vice versa. In other words, the computational utility of a trigonometric

 table can be completely accomplished by these algorithms.113 Surprisingly, no scholar

 at the time advocated the replacement of trigonometric tables with these algorithms.

 107 For Dong's treatise and contribution in these "power-series" algorithms, see Guo and Li (2010,731
 733). For the discussions on the Methods of Piles, see Martzloff (1997,302-304, 341-351).

 108 Han Qi determines the date of composition of Xu's treatise to be prior to 1840; see Han (1993). For
 more discussion on Xu's treatise, see Li (1993) and Guo and Li (2010, 748-750). Note that Li's work
 contains incorrect information on the composition date of Xu's treatise, cf. Han (1993). Xu's treatise can
 be seen in Xu (1840).

 109 Li's treatise can be seen in Li (1845). Li Shanlan was an outstanding Chinese mathematician and

 educator in the nineteenth century. In addition to his own original mathematical results and treatises, his

 translation works include Books 7 through 15 of Euclid's Element，an algebra book, and the first calculus
 book in China. For brief discussion of Li Shanlan's contributions to Chinese mathematics in the nineteenth

 century, see Martzloff (1997,173-176) and Guo and Li (2010, 738-748, 753-754).

 110 Xiang's treatise discusses numerous topics. Algorithms of finding the tangent and secant lines of an

 arc only appear in the sixth Chapter (Juan 卷)，based on the known length of the sine or versed sine line.

 The treatise was not finished when Xiang died in 1850. On the request of Xiang's son, Dai Xu edited and

 supplemented some of the chapters; see Xiang (1849, 600). For more discussion on Xiang's treatise, see
 Guo and Li (2010,733-735).

 111 For more discussion on Dai Xu's treatise, see Guo and Li (2010,735-738). For Dai Xu's treatises, see
 Dai (1852).

 112 1\vo somewhat similar tables can be found in Li (1993) and Li (2000, 190-194). I thank Professor

 Han Qi for bringing these two sources to my attentions. The topics of "series expansion" of trigonometric

 and other functions are very rich and active in nineteenth-century China. For example, Dong's treatise
 has algorithms which find the chords and sagittae of multiples and fractions of the arc with the sine and

 the versed sine lines are given. Xu's includes algorithms involving the area of a circle, the volumes of a

 sphere, and an ellipse as well as finding trigonometric lines of an arc provided other trigonometric lines

 for an integer multiple or fraction of the arc are known. In some treatises, the expansion of tangent, secant,

 cotangent, and cosecant lines is in terms of sine and versed sine lines, not in terms of the length of the arc.

 Separated projects and discussions are needed to do these topics justice.

 113 With a trigonometric table, complex and tedious computations were carried out during the process of

 construction, and therefore, computational tasks can be made easier and expedited by checking the values

 in the table; with these "quick-method" algorithms, a practitioner still has to carry out the computation

 manually no matter how efficient and quick the algorithms make the computations appear.

 Instead, they emphasized that the trigonometric tables can be constructed quickly by

 applying these algorithms. That is to say, what these algorithms replaced was not

 the trigonometric table itself but its construction principles, the Six Essentials, Three

 Important, and Two Simple Methods.

 Xu Youren and Dai Xu each have a treatise discussing the quick method of con

 structing tables. Xu's is called Zao gebiao jianfa 造各表簡法（Simple Methods for

 Constructing Each Table), which discusses the methods of constructing tables of sine,

 versed sine, and tangent lines; it also gives the instruction as how a logarithmic table

 and a logarithmic trigonometric table can be made.114 Qiubiao jiefa 求表捷術(Quick

 one to ten, after that every 10° from twenty to eighty, and lastly, the arc length of a

 quadrant, one-half of a circle, and the full circle.115 Neither treatise actually constructs

 Trigonometric tables: explicating their construction.

 This "power-series" approach to constructing tables merited an introduction in the

 Protestant journal Liuhe congtan 六合叢談(Shanghae Series), a monthly publication

 in Chinese disseminating new knowledge and introducing new fields in the Western

 science to the general public in addition to reporting certain news around the world.

 Edited by the missionary Alexander Wylie (1815-1887), the journal was in circulation

 from January 1857 to June 1858 before abruptly stopped due to poor finance.116 In the

 June issue of 1857, the notices of new books briefly discuss Xu's and Dai's books on

 constructing tables.117 Starting with the old construction principles, the notice quickly

 moves to describing the new approach initiated by Jartoux and pioneered in China by

 Ming Antu and his disciple Chen Jixin 陳際新（late eighteenth century). It also men

 tioned all the treatises of the series approach discussed earlier, describing the scope

 of the algorithms in the books and at times commenting on their strengths. Besides
 trigonometric tables, logarithmic tables and their construction are also mentioned.

 This notice to new books demonstrates that the new mathematical developments fash

 ioned by Chinese scholars were also accessible to and noticed by foreigners working
 in China.

 10 Discoursing trigonometric table and the construction principles

 As far as we know, no mathematical treatise post 1860 discusses the “power-series”

 approach to constructing trigonometric tables. Our story of trigonometric tables and

 the evolution and explication of their construction principles in China is drawing to
 an end. Let us recount the episodes briefly.

 Trigonometric tables and the algorithms to construct them were introduced into

 China by the Jesuits as part of the effort to reform the Calendar circa 1630. While the

 computational power of the trigonometric table was acknowledged by all, the “absent”
 explanation of how these algorithms were established in the treatise remained an

 enduring criticism of the Jesuits by some Chinese scholars.118 Generations of scholars

 strived to find how the construction principles were derived. Successful as they were
 in deriving the principles and in adding new algorithms to facilitate edification, few

 new trigonometric tables were actually constructed afresh. Some tables included in

 the treatises were outright plagiarized or simplified from the translated table by the

 Jesuits; some were re-worked based on existing tables. The only trigonometric table

 built anew consists entirely or sine lines utilizing a peculiar measure for arcs that no
 one else uses.

 Starting from three early eighteenth-century, Jesuit-introduced algorithms resem

 bling the modern-day series expansion for the circumference of a circle, sine lines,

 and versine lines, Chinese scholars in the late eighteenth century and the first half

 116 For a discussion on this journal, see Elman (2005,297-299).

 117 Though the journal was published in Chinese, it did have a table of content in English. The title of this

 Notice is "Tae Heu's Logarithms, and Seu Yew-jin on the construction of Trigonometric and Logarithmic

 tables." Tae Heu and Seu Yew-jin are the Romanization of the names pronounced in a local dialect for Dai
 Xu and Xu Youren, respectively. See Shen (2006,627-628).

 118 To be fair, the explanation to the three important and two simple methods in Grand Measure amounts
 to proving their validity with the exception of (2-2), as discussed earlier.

 of the nineteenth century again investigated how these algorithms were established.

 They succeeded spectacularly in deriving these algorithms from a series of similar

 isosceles triangles and the pattern they demonstrate; moreover, they greatly expanded

 the repertoire of algorithms of similar nature. With these powerful and efficient algo

 rithms, the task of constructing a trigonometric table was made much easier, yet the

 general direction to construct trigonometric tables was disseminated without much

 fanfare for actual construction. This uneven treatment of the construction principles

 and trigonometric tables is worth our reflection.

 Foremost, constructing a trigonometric table is a time-consuming business, com

 manding great resources. In our earlier discussion, the table included in Numbers and

 Principles was augmented from an existing table and completed with the backing of

 a dynasty's resources. It would have been almost impossible for an individual scholar

 to accomplish such a feat. Speculated to be constructed anew, An Qingqiao's table

 has merely 250 entries, built with new, powerful algorithms and an obscure measuring

 system, both of which facilitate and expedite computation. These examples point to

 the difficulties an individual encounters in constructing a trigonometric table alone.

 Therefore, it is understandable and expected that a treatise authored by an individ

 ual scholar not have a trigonometric table constructed from scratch by following the

 principles elucidated in the treatise.

 The second interpretation of such an uneven treatment is more subtle and of intricate

 nature. It is in the context of classification of “scientific knowledge" in early modern

 China and the views on this issue held by the actors of the time. A little background

 discussion is in order before we delve into our specific case, situating mathematics in

 the general intellectual history at the time.

 According to certain intellectual historians, Chinese scholars well versed in
 mathematics and calendric science had tried to reconcile natural philosophy with
 mathematical studies since the seventeenth century.119 Mei Wending's works are a

 prime example. In his “Discussions of Rectangular Array” (Fangcheng lun 方程論)，

 Mei explicitly describes his efforts to explain the reason behind the procedures as

 "illuminating the principle of mathematics” (ming suanli 明算述)，li 理 being the
 pervasive notion in Neo-Confucianism in the state-sanctioned curriculum in the civil

 examinations in Ming and Qing.120 Efforts such as Mei's culminate in the integration

 of mathematics in evidential scholarship (kaozheng xue 考sa學）in the eighteenth

 century.121 Consequently, mathematics along with astronomy and calenanc science

 by then had simply become an integral part of classical studies, at least for many
 evidential scholars.

 This perspective of mathematics allows us to place trigonometric tables and the

 explication of their construction principles into different genres of knowledge from

 119 For the discussions on the efforts by various Qing scholars, see Elman (2001,218-221).

 120 Neo-Confucianism is also described in Chinese as "Song-Ming lixue 宋明理學(the learning if li during

 the Song (960-1278) and Ming Dynasties)." The meaning of li is rather fluid, depending on the context. A

 universal translation that fits all contexts is almost impossible. The usual translation of li is "moral principle，’’

 which does not fit our purpose here. As li is omnipresent in all things, its governing of mathematics is
 sometimes referred to as suanli or li of mathematics.

 121 See Elman (2001，218-221) for detailed discussions, cited from Jami (2007,147).

 the actor's viewpoint. On the one hand, the explication of principles, including the

 geometric figures, the derivation and establishment of algorithms, and the assertive

 explanation connecting the Western approach to classical texts, serves to illuminate

 the connection between the subject matter and the underlying governing principle, li，

 and then by extension to the Classic knowledge. As the discussions of construction

 principles constitute the main body of treatises, they fit perfectly with what Catherine

 Jami terms as "science as discourse." The actual construction of trigonometric tables,

 on the other hand, can be carried out by practitioners with limited training to produce
 a tool, which contributes in the service of statecraft to "enhance the control over the

 world—heaven, earth, and man."122 Once a trigonometric table is constructed, it can

 continually be utilized without any need to comprehend how it was built by a large

 number of practitioners over a long time until the need arises to improve or replace

 it. That is, trigonometric tables fall under what Jami describes as "science as action."

 Literati were well aware that knowledge of this type is distinctively different from that

 contained in the discourse and explanation of the principles. For example, Qin Huitian

 秦蕙田（1702-1764)，a minister of Justice at Qianlong Emperor's (reigned 1735

 1795) court, describes in his preface to Dai Zhen's Gougu geyuan ji 句股割圜記

 (The Records of Base-Altitude and Circle-Division) that "learning the [mathematical]

 algorithms without obtaining their principles, [this kind of learning] then [is] repetitive
 and tragmental, similar to [learning] skills.’’123

 The traditional Chinese term for the knowledge of the action kind was ji 技 or jineng

 技倉ê (skills).124 Treatises as the main platform for discoursing knowledge and as the

 product of "science as discourse” are therefore partial to discussions of construction

 principles over the actual making of the table. The view that trigonometric tables

 are merely products of certain skills can also explain why scholars might consider it

 acceptable to include in their treatises an existing table or a simplified version of it.

 Moreover, such a practice would not create contention of priority.

 Another interesting observation brings out a related but somewhat different issue:

 Two authors in our analysis boasted explicitly that their tables are shortened, be it with

 fewer trigonometric lines (functions) or adopting a coarser increment, and therefore

 improvement to the Western-made tables, replacing numerous entries with a few algo
 rithms. Both Li Zijin and An Qingqiao expressed such a view. Li claims, "The old
 table has ninety some pages; [we] cannot see [the usefulness] of its multitude. This

 table has merely seven and one-half pages; [we] do not experience [the deficiency]
 of its meagerness." An's states, "Now [we] take from both the Chinese and Western

 methods.. • to make the table of one line. [This approach] increases the completeness

 of the principle, but the entries in the tables are rather simplistic. The table of eight
 lines in the Western method can be left to rest.”125

 122 See Jami (2007,148) for the quote.

 123 The text by Qin reads,'溜其術不得其理，則繁碎而近於藝.’’ See Dai (1961,770).

 124 The actual construction of the table should be considered a skill. The quote and Jami's description of
 science can be seen in Jami (2007,146-150).

 125 Li's texts read, ‘‘jiubiao jiushiyu ye.. .er bujian qiduo, jinbiao buguo qiye you ban... er bujian
 qishao舊表九十餘葉,而不見其多…今表不通七萦有半…而不見其少.” See (Li Zijing 1763). An's read,

 This peculiar practice runs directly counter to the core function of trigonometric

 tables一minimizing and expediting calculations. As the governing principles should be

 "simplistic" (jian 簡)and "refined" (jing 精)，the practice of shortening trigonometric

 tables seems to suggest an effort by these scholars to repackage a product in the science

 as-action genre to be in line with knowledge of possession of certain characteristics

 of the principles. The motivations for such adjustments to trigonometric tables can

 be manifold: the desire to show that Chinese works are superior to and therefore can

 replace the Western ones, foreign knowledge should be domesticated and conform to

 the Cninese standard, or a simple economic reason to reduce the cost of printing.

 In 1877, the translation of a trigonometric treatise introduced a new, different kinds

 of trigonometric knowledge into China.126 The difference commences from the very

 beginning: The trigonometric values of an (acute) angle were defined as the ratios of the

 lengths or sides in a right triangle, in contrast to the old definition as the line segments

 associated with an arc. This intrinsically different treatment of trigonometry should

 have undoubtedly enriched the knowledge developed and accumulated from before

 1850. The transition, appropriation, and the conflicts of the old and new treatments

 of trigonometry in China should prove to be interesting as a sequel to our current

 investigation. And that will require further exploration and examination; for sure，it

 will be a story for another day.
