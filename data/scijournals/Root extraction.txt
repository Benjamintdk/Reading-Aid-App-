 Abstract In this paper, we study the extraction of roots as presented by Al-Kashi
 in his 1427 book "Key to Arithmetic" and Stevin in his 1585 book "Arithmetic". In

 analyzing their methods, we note that Stevin's technique contains some flaws that we

 amend to present a coherent algorithm. We then show that the underlying algorithm
 for the methods of both Al-Kashi and Stevin is the same.

 1 Introduction

 In 1427, Jamshid Al-Kashi completed a monumental book in Arabic on arithmetic

 called Miftâh al-hisâb, "Key to Arithmetic" that encompasses arithmetic, algebra,

 and measurement. In this book, among other things, Al-Kashi provides a method of

 extracting nth roots and apply it to numbers in the trillions. Given a positive integer
 N, his algorithm produces an approximation R = to \/N such that Rn < N.
 Moreover, when A is a perfect nth power, it produces the exact root.

 In 1585, Simon Stevin published an influential book in French called L'arithmétique,

 "Arithmetic". Actually, it is two books put together, with definitions in the first book

 and operations that include rules of ordinary arithmetic, radicals, polynomials, and

 equations in the second book. In the second part of this book, Stevin dedicated a sec

 tion to extracting roots. He applied the method he presented to the extraction of roots

 of integers and fractions to any degree of accuracy.

 The problem of the extraction of roots has been extensively studied, and many

 methods have been developed throughout the centuries (Dakhel 1960; Rashed 1978,

 1994). Here, we look at the two previously mentioned examples emanating from two

 mathematicians who had great influence in their respective regions at different periods

 of time. In exploring Stevin's method, we found that it presents some flaws mainly due

 to oversimplifying some optimizations. We provide amendments that make Stevin's

 method viable. Then, we show that although the presentations of the methods as given

 by Al-Kashi and Stevin look different, the underlying algorithm is in fact the same.

 We note that, to the best of our knowledge, there is no proof of direct link between

 Al-Kashi and Stevin. Following Berggren (1986), we will provide a justification for
 the extraction of roots.

 2 Brief history

 Jamshid Al-Kashi (1380—1429) was an Islamic scientist who was born in Kashan

 (modern day Iran) around 1380 and passed away in Samarkand (modern day Uzbek

 istan) on June 22,1429. His accomplishments, mostly in mathematics and astronomy,

 have been well documented and dated. His best work was achieved under the patronage

 of Ulugh Beg who was a great scientist in his own right and the ruler of Samarkand
 at the time. As Samarkand grew into a world-class scientific center, Al-Kashi was

 considered as one of the leading scientists in the city. His work spanned many areas of

 mathematics and astronomy, dealing with arithmetic, algebra, trigonometric functions,

 astronomical tables, and numerical approximations. In terms of findings and exposi

 tion, he was well ahead of his time. For example, Al-Kashi used a fine pedagogy (Taani

 2014), explicitly and thoroughly explained decimal fractions in his work more than a

 hundred and fifty years before Stevin (Luckey 1951), and obtained an approximation

 of π correct to 16 decimal places (Hogendijk 2009) that was unsurpassed for nearly

 200 years. Without doubt, Al-Kashi's most remarkable book is Miftàh al-hisâb, "Key

 to Arithmetic", which he finished on March 2, 1427. It is a part of this book that we

 are concerned with in this paper.

 Simon Stevin (1548-1620) was a Flemish scientist born in Bruges in present

 day Belgium around 1548 and passed away in The Hague on February 1620. His
 work covered many areas such as architecture, geography, mathematics, music, and

 navigation. Many of his scientific accomplishments came out while he was working
 for the Prince Maurice, Count of Nassau, first as an advisor and later at different other

 positions as a public officer. Stevin was a renowned scientist who contributed to the

 dissemination and acceptance of many mathematical concepts in Europe. For example,

 it is through the English translation of his book "La Theinde", that Thomas Jefferson

 proposed a decimal currency in the USA. Stevin's introduction and popularization of

 many mathematical notations that are still in use today, such as the square root symbol,

 is another legacy of his. Just like Al-Kashi, Stevin usually provides the reader with

 many examples and methods for solving a given problem. This is a striking similarity

 with Al-Kashi that we are bound to observe in his book L'arithmétique, "Arithmetic"

 which he published in 1585. It is a part of this book that we are dealing with in this

 paper.

 3 Root extraction in Al-Kashi's work

 In Mifiah, Al-Kashi starts the process of extracting roots by defining roots. He intro

 duces and explains the idea of cycles that is central in his method of extracting roots.

 Then, he describes the square root algorithm and its layout in general for an arbitrary

 number. The algorithm is executed using a table, and his description is purely in prose.

 He illustrates the algorithm with a few examples, but he does not provide a formal

 justification as to why it works. Dakhel (1960) and Berggren (1986) give a theoretical

 basis and justification for the algorithm. Al-Kashi then goes on to describing a general

 algorithm to approximate a root of any degree. The general algorithm is a natural

 generalization of the square root algorithm. Hence, we start by describing the square

 root algorithm in some detail and then, we provide the general case of extraction of
 roots.

 3.1 The square root algorithm of Al-Kashi

 In chapter five of Al-Kashi (1977), Al-Kashi describes his square root algorithm in

 general but entirely in words. Here, we closely follow his description although in the

 language and notation of modern mathematics. To provide a clear and concise account

 without loss of generality, we illustrate the algorithm using an integer with a given

 number of digits. The general case of an integer with any number of digits is then

 obvious, and we undertake that task in the description of the extraction of nth roots
 that follows.

 Given an integer N, its digits are divided into groups of two that Al-Kashi calls

 "cycles" starting from the units digit. Let us assume, for the sake of illustration, that Ν

 is a 6-digit integer, say Ν = abcdef (the argument applies to integers of any number

 of digits). So, for a 6-digit number, the cycles are ab, cd, and ef. (If Ν was a 5-digit

 integer, the last cycle would have contained one digit). Among their other uses in the

 algorithm, the cycles determine the number of digits in the integer part of the square

 root. So, for example, since in our case, the number Ν has 3 cycles; the square root

 will be formed by 3 digits, that is, a number in the hundreds. After creating the cycles,

 Al-Kashi looks for -JN one digit at a time starting form the left. First, he looks for

 the integer part of the root of the left most cycle. So, Al-Kashi will be looking for the

 square root of ab first. He considers the greatest integer A whose square is less than

 or equal to the number formed by the cycle; A2 < ab. A will be the left most digit of

 the integer part of -J~N. He then computes the difference Pq = ab - A2 and forms a
 new number Pocd, where Pocd is the concatenation of Pq and cd. Observe that, since

 ab is a number with two digits, Pq is a digit and the number Pocd is in the hundreds.

 294 Ν. Aydin, L. Hammoudi

 Now, Al-Kashi looks for the greatest integer Β such that (2A -10 + B) ■ Β < Pocd,

 where 2A is the double of A. That number Β is the second digit of -JN. To look for

 the third digit, Al-Kashi considers the difference P\ = Pocd - (2A ■ 10 + B) ■ Β and

 forms the number P\ef, where 2A is the double of A and P\ef is the concatenation

 of P\ and ef. At this point, he proceeds as he did previously to find A and Β. He

 looks for the largest integer C such that (2 A Β ■ 10 + C) · C < P\ef, where A Β
 is the concatenation of A and B, and 2AB is the double of AB. This digit C is

 the third digit (from the left) of the integer part of y/~N. At last, he computes the

 difference Pi — P\ef - (2 A Β ■ 10 + C) ■ C. If Pi = 0, then the process is finished

 and ABC — -/N. Otherwise, Al-Kashi takes Pi as the numerator of the fractional part

 of the square root and (2A β ■ 10 -F C) + C +1 = 2 ABC +1 as the denominator. Thus,

 2AB&+1 ke the fractional part of the square root. In other words, ABC 2A/ç+1 *s

 an approximation to s/~N.

 We remark that Al-Kashi made great use of approximate square roots in his remark

 able approximation of π (Hogendijk 2009).

 3.2 Example

 Here, we provide an example of extraction of a square root, taken from Miftah

 (Al-Kashi 1969, 1977), and show how to execute the algorithm described above using

 a table as presented by Al-Kashi. The example is important as it provides the prac

 tical framework [it is also explained in Berggren (1986)]. We use the same notation

 as in the general description for further clarity. We would like to extract the square
 root of the number 331781. Al-Kashi divides this number into cycles of two digits
 ab = 33, cd = 17 and ef — 81 using a table as follows.

 First, find the greatest integer A whose square is less than or equal to the number

 formed by the cycle 33. A2 < 33; A = 5 and place it on the top and bottom of the

 table to get the next table.

 Now, we compute Pq = 33 - 52; Po = 8 and put it underneath the 33. We consider
 the number 817. We also double 5; 2 · 5 = 10 and write it above the bottom 5 shifted

 one place to the right

 Next, look for the greatest number Β such that (2-5-10 + B) ■ Β < 817. By

 inspection, we find that Β = 7 which we write on the top and the bottom of the second
 column.

 33  17 81

 We compute the difference Pi = 817 - (2 ■ 5 · 10 + 7) ■ 7, so, Pi = 68. We put it in

 the second column below 17 and form the number 6881. We also double the last digit

 of 107 which becomes 114 and write it above the 107 shifted one place to the right.

 Now, we look for the greatest number C such that (114 -10 + C) · C < 6881. We

 find, C = 6 which write on the top and the bottom of the third column.

 Next, P2 = 6881 - (2 · 57 · 10 + 6) · 6 That is, P2 = 5. Put it in the third column

 below 81. The integer part is found, and P2 = 5 φ 0 is the numerator of the fractional

 part of the root. Doubling the last digit of 1146, it becomes 1152. The denominator is
 1152+ 1 = 1153.

 So, we found V331781 » 576——·

 3.3 Extraction of higher order roots in Al-Kashi's work

 Although the computations become more tedious, the same algorithm can be naturally

 generalized to obtain approximate roots of higher orders. Al-Kashi gives a general

 description of his algorithm for extraction of roots of any order, again purely in prose.

 He illustrates his method (Al-Kashi 1969, 1977) by finding the fifth root of the number
 Ν = 44240899506197. We will consider this example after we describe Al-Kashi's
 general method using the language and notation of modern mathematics. We keep the

 notations of the previous section.

 Let Ν = a\a2 ... am, m > 2 be an m-digit integer. To extract its nth root, Al-Kashi

 divides the digits of Ν into cycles of length η starting from the right. He looks at the left

 most cycle of N, let us say a\a2 ■ ■ ■ at, where k < η and finds the integer part of its nth

 root. That is the largest integer A whose nth power is less than or equal to the number

 formed by the cycle; A" < a\U2.. .α*. A will be the left most digit of the integer

 part of y/N. To look for the next digit of the root, Al-Kashi computes the difference

 Pq = a\ci2... ak - An and forms a new number Po<++l · · · <++«> where α*+ι... ak+n

 is the second (from the left) cycle of N, and Poak+ι... ak+n is the concatenation of

 Po and ak+1... ak+n. He then considers the quantity

 /1(Β) = ^"^10"-1Α"-1β° + ···+ ^101A1Bn-2 + ^IOVb"-1^.

 Al-Kashi computes f\ (B) in several steps and by the help of a table [see Berggren
 (1986) for more details] and looks for the largest integer Β such that f{B) <
 Poak+ι... ak+n- That number Β is the second digit of (integer part of) \'/N. To look

 for the third digit, Al-Kashi considers the difference P\ = Po+fc+i · · ■ ak+n - fi(B)

 and forms the number P\dk+n+\ · · -ak+in, where dk+n+] ■ ■ ■ +t+2« is the third

 (from the left) cycle of N, and P\dk+n+\ ■.. ak+2n is the concatenation of P\ and

 aic+n+i ■ ■ ■ ak+2n- Now, he considers the quantity

 /2(C) = + · · · + " JlO'iA*)1?

 +
 -^100(AB)°C"-^C

 and looks for the largest number C such that /2(C) < P\ak+n+i ■ ■ ■ α*+2η· This digit

 C is the third digit (from the left) of the integer part of y/N. He continues in this

 way until he gets all the digits of y/N. The last difference is Pff ], where Γ7Ι is the

 smallest integer not less than f- If Pj-ai = 0, then the process is finished, and y/N

 is an integer r = ABC... Otherwise, y/N s» is an underestimation of the root,
 where r = ABC... is the largest integer such that rn < N,u = P\<n-\ = Ν — r" and
 υ = (r + 1)" — rn.

 According to Rashed (1994), Al-Kashi's algorithm for extracting nth roots is a

 special case of what is known as the Ruffini-Horner method, which Dakhel states

 is a misleading name because "the method was already used by Islamic and Chinese

 mathematicians long before either Ruffini or Horner lived" (Dakhel 1960). Rashed also

 states that Al-Kashi's algorithm comes from Al-Karaji school, after the tenth-century

 mathematician Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad Ibn Al-Husayn Al-Karaji (953-1029) who

 is well known for his work in algebra (Rashed 1978, 1994).

 3.3.1 Example

 Al-Kashi illustrates his method on the example of finding the fifth root of Ν =

 44240899506197. From the description of the general algorithm, we know apriori
 that his approximation will produce R — r^, where r is the largest integer such
 that r5 < Ν, u = Ν — r5 and ν = (r + l)5 - r5. Therefore, the outcome on

 this particular example will be 5364^423774ό2§1 · The digits of r are again obtained
 one at a time using the cycles. In the case of the 5th root, the cycles have 5 dig
 its (in the general case of nth root, cycles have η digits). The cycles count the

 numbers of 10°, 105,1010,... in A (each being a perfect 5th power), and the num
 ber of cycles determines the number of digits in r. In this example, r = ABC,
 each digit corresponding to one of the cycles 4424, 08995, and 06197. The first

 step in the algorithm is to find the largest integer (digit) A such that A5 < 4424.

 By inspection, A = 5. In finding other digits, Al-Kashi makes use of the identity

 (x + y)5 - y5 = ((((((s)y + (4)*)y + @J:2)y + (2)·* )y + (f)^4)^)^· He arranges
 his work in a more elaborate table to facilitate the computation of the quantity on the

 right side of the last equation. Even though computational details are more involved,

 the main idea behind the procedure remains the same. More details can be found in
 Berggren (1986).

 4 Root extraction in Stevin's work

 In L'arithmétique, Stevin dedicates 16 examples of a variety of extractions of roots.

 He starts by laying out the grounds for a general scheme in problem XVIII: "Given

 a simple geometric number, find its required root." To solve this problem, Stevin
 produces Pascal-like triangles:

 2 20

 3*3 3 * 30
 4 * * * 4 4 * 6 * 40
 5 5 5 * 10 * 10 * 50
 6 6 6 * 15 * 20 * 15 * 60

 Then, he uses them in the extraction of square roots, cube roots, fourth roots, and

 fifth roots. Just as in Al-Kashi's examples, there is no proof or justification of why

 the algorithm works. There are, however, checks that the roots found are the desired

 ones. Moreover, the general algorithm here is a natural generalization of the square

 root algorithm, just like Al-Kashi's. We start by describing the square root algorithm.

 It is worth mentioning that all the examples that Stevin treats are numerical with no
 variables.

 4.1 The square root algorithm of Stevin

 In our investigation of the algorithm, we analyze Stevin's first examples as described in

 his book (Stevin 1625) and describe it in modern mathematics. By following Stevin's
 method word for word, we found a flaw in his method and noticed that it does not work

 in general. For example, Stevin extracts the square root of the number 186624 and

 finds the correct root which is 432, but if we apply the same algorithm to the number

 331781 from Al-Kashi's work (given above) then Stevin's method does not work.

 We illustrate this with the two numbers just mentioned and pinpoint where Stevin's

 method fails. We will then show how to remedy the situation.

 4.1.1 Stevin's example of square root extraction

 This is the authors' translation from the French of Stevin's first example in pages

 102-103 of his book (Stevin 1625). Stevin's second example is similar to the first one

 and runs into the same problems.

 Beginning of translation.

 Explanation of the given. Given a square number 186624. Explanation of the

 Similarly, a dot under the 6, leaving a digit in two. Then, a dot under 8, similarly

 leaving a digit in two. Similarly, we put more dots if there are more digits. These three

 dots indicate the three positions of the three digits which will come out of the required

 root, so that the disposition is as follows. Then, it is necessary to take the square root

 in integer part of 18, as close as possible but lower which is 4. We put it on the first
 dot under the 8.

 Then, we subtract the square of 4 which is 16 from 18. It remains 2 which we put

 above the 8 and cross 16 and 18. Their disposition is then as follows.

 18 66 24

 2

 Jt8T 66 24

 But to find the second digit of the root, one must put aside 20 (which is the number

 serving in general in the extraction of any square root, as we said above in the note of

 this problem). In front of this same 20, one must put what comes as a root, namely 4.

 We multiply the 20 by 4 to get 80: Similarly, we need to divide the 266 and find as a

 quotient 3, which is put on the second dot between the lines and also joining the 20

 which are put aside: Also, we put under the 3 its square 9, and their disposition is as
 follows.

 9. J# 66 24

 Then, it is necessary to multiply the 20 by the 4 which is 80, and this same number

 by 3 to get 240 which we put by the 3 and add 9 to get 249. We put it also below

 the 266 and subtract them. The remainder is 17, and their disposition will be then as
 follows.

 But to find the third digit of the root, one must proceed in the same way as we

 did in finding the second digit. We put then, as above, aside 20 (namely the 20 which

 generally helps in any extraction of square root) and in front of this same 20, we put

 what comes out as a root, namely 43. By multiplying the 20 by 43, we get 860 by

 which is divided 1734 [probably a typo, should be 1724] to find 2 as quotient which

 we put on the third dot between the lines and also joining the 20 which are put aside.

 Also, we put below the said 2 its square 4 and the disposition is such.

 Then, we multiply the 20 by 43 which make 860 and this same number by 2 to get

 1720 which are put next to the 2 and by adding to it again 4, the sum becomes 1724.

 We put it also under the 1724 of the extraction and subtract them to find zero as a

 reminder. Then, the achieved disposition is such that.

 I say that 432 is the required root. Proof. By multiplying 432 by itself, we get the

 product 186624 which is equal to the given square number. So, 432 is the true root

 which is required to prove.

 End of translation.

 4.1.2 Counterexample to Stevin's square root extraction

 The above example of Stevin's provides the correct square root of the number
 186624, V186624 = 432. However, it has a flaw that one can detect with the fol

 lowing counterexample. Let us follow Stevin's method as described above and try to

 find the square root of the number 331781 from Al-Kashi. We found using Al-Kashi's

 method that V331781 ~ 576 γ^.

 Root extraction by Al-Kashi and Stevin 301

 To extract the square root of the number 331781 using Stevin's method, divide

 it into cycles of two digits, by spacing them and drawing horizontal lines with dots

 between them at the beginning of each cycle.

 Let us find the greatest integer Λ whose square is less than or equal to the number

 formed by the cycle 33. A2 < 33; A = 5 and place it on the first dot under the 3. We

 compute 33 - 52 = 8. Cross 25 and 33 to get the next table.

 To find the second digit of the square root, we put aside 20 and in front of it 5. We

 multiply 20 · 5 = 100. We consider the number 817 and divide it by 100. Its integer

 part is 8 which we put as the second digit of the root on the second dot.

 We can readily see that the process is giving us the wrong square root of 331781

 as the second digit of the square root is found to be 8 instead of the correct digit 7.

 Moreover, if we continue the process, then we would have to subtract 20 · 5 · 8 + 64 =

 864 from 817 which is not possible for such an algorithm (Stevin never gets negative

 numbers in the execution of the algorithm). The problem is mainly due to the fact

 that in looking for the second digit of the square root, Stevin uses a simple division

 operation instead of the more complex constraint equation (inequality) used in Al
 Kashi's method. This appears to be the case at all stages where satisfying such a

 constraint is required. Actually, right after that glitch in the process, Stevin goes on

 to subtracting those same quantities that should have been optimized in the previous

 step. So, in fact, Stevin is using formulas and quantities in his process of subtraction

 that should have been used earlier. For example, in this counterexample, one can look

 for the second digit of the root as the number (digit) that satisfies the constraint:
 the greatest number Β such that 20 · 5 ■ Β + Β2 < 817. This yields Β = 7. In
 considering the division of 817 by 20, Stevin misses out the B2 part. That did not

 matter in Stevin's example as B2 = 9 is small compared to Al-Kashi's example where

 B2 = 49. Moreover, in the next step of the process of finding the square root, had Stevin

 found the correct Β, he would have considered the subtraction 817 — (20 · 5 Β + Β2)

 which would have been correct. In conclusion, the only problem that we found in

 Stevin's algorithm is his failing to use the optimization at all the stages where it is

 required. This becomes more tedious in the extraction of higher roots.

 Let us now apply the above proposed remedy to Stevin's algorithm and describe

 it in modern mathematics. Since most of the algorithm works well, we will clearly

 specify our amendment below. Then, we will briefly take on Al-Kashi's example to
 show how this amended algorithm works.

 4.1.3 The square root algorithm of Stevin, amended

 We adopt analogous notations to Al-Kashi's extraction of roots method described
 above.

 Given a number N, Stevin divides the digits constituting Ν into pairs starting from

 the right. If the number of digits forming Ν is odd, then the last cycle in the left

 will have only one digit. This subdivision of the digits corresponds to the cycles in

 Al-Kashi's work and provides the number of digits in the square root. Stevin looks

 for (integer part of) -JN one digit at a time starting form the left. Each cycle will

 provide a digit of the root. Without loss of generality, and following our investigation
 of Al-Kashi's square root extraction above, we let Ν — abcdef. A generalization

 of the process to an integer with any number of digits follows naturally. To find the

 first digit of the square root, Stevin considers the greatest integer A with A2 < ah.
 A will be the left digit of the integer part of ~/N. He then computes the difference
 % = ab - A2 and considers the number 20A.

 (He then, looks for the integer Β of the division of %cd by 20A, where %cd is the

 concatenation of To and cd.)

 Amendment: He then, looks for the greatest integer Β such that 20Αβ + B2 <

 To cd, where Α β is the concatenation of A and B, 20 A Β is 20 times the number A Β

 and To cd is the concatenation of To and cd.

 That number Β is the second digit of fJî. Now, Stevin considers the difference Ti =

 To cd - (20 AB + B2) and forms the number Τ\ef, where Tie/ is the concatenation
 of Tj and ef.

 (Then, as he did previously, he proceeds to find the number C as the integer part of

 the division of Tie/ by 20 AB, where Tie/ is the concatenation of Ti and ef.)

 Amendment: Then, as he did previously, he proceeds to find the greatest integer

 C with the property 20ABC + C2 < Tie/, where ABC is the concatenation of Α, β

 and C and Tie/ is the concatenation of Ti and ef.

 This number C is the third digit (from the left) of the integer part of J~N. Finally,

 he computes the difference T2 = Tie/ — {20ABC + C2). IfT2 = 0, then the process

 is finished and ABC = \fN. Otherwise, -J~N ABCis an approximation
 of the square root.

 formed by the cycle 33. A2 < 33; A = 5 and place it on the first dot under the 3.

 Compute To = 33 - 52 = 8. Cross 25 and 33 to get the next table.

 Root extraction by Al-Kashi and Stevin 303

 4.1.4 Example

 Here, we illustrate the amended Stevin's method using a specific example. To draw a

 parallel with Al-Kashi's method, we use the same number as in Al-Kashi's, namely

 331781. Moreover, this number will help us tackle Stevin's method of finding the

 fractional part of the square root. In his book, Stevin uses 186624 which is a perfect

 square number of the same order. Thus, in one setting, we are showing two examples

 from Stevin's book, extraction of the integer part of the square root and finding its

 fractional part. The example below is important as it presents the practical framework.

 To extract the square root of the number 331781, Stevin divides it into cycles of

 two digits, ab = 33, cd = 17 and ef = 81 by spacing them and drawing horizontal

 lines with dots between them at the beginning of each cycle.

 33 17 81

 To find the second digit of the root, we put aside 20 and in front of it 5. We multiply

 20 · 5 = 100 and consider the number 817 to look for the greatest integer Β such that
 20 · 5 · Β + Β2 < 817. Β = 7, which is put on the second dot between the lines and

 also joining the 20. We also put under the 7, its square 49 and their disposition is as
 follows.

 Then, compute Tj. Put 20 · 5 · 7 = 700 next to 7. Then, we add 700 + 49 = 749

 Now, we look for the third digit. We put aside 20 and in front of it, we put 57. We

 multiply 20 · 57 = 114 and consider the number 6881 to look for the greatest integer
 C, with 20-57 ■ C + C2 < 6881. C = 6, which is put on the second dot between
 the lines and also joining the 20. We also put under the 6, its square 36 and their

 disposition is as follows.

 Finally, we found that the integer part of the square root is 576 and since the last

 a denominator of 2 ■ 576 + 1. Thus, λ/331781 « 576 γ^·

 Then, we compute I2· We start by computing 20 · 57 · 6 = 6840 and put it next to

 rithm which we amended to provide a correct one. That same exact problem of using a

 simple division to find the digits of the root instead of the far more complex optimiza

 tion process persists in all of his extractions of roots at all stages where such a process

 is called. Since all of the other stages of Stevin's algorithm are correct, we propose

 amendments to provide a correct root extraction algorithm. We follow the square root

 algorithm description and use analogous notations. Moreover, we keep our account of

 the process close to the process of Al-Kashi to better compare the two algorithms. We

 then provide a brief example showing how the algorithm effectively works.

 4.2.1 Extraction of higher order roots in Stevin's work, amended

 Consider an m-digit integer Ν = a\a2... am, m > 2. The aim is to extract its nth

 root. To that end, Stevin divides the digits of Ν into cycles of length η starting from

 the right. Assuming that a\ai... α*, k < η is the left most cycle of N, Stevin finds

 the greatest integer A such that A" < a\ai... a*. This integer A is the left most digit

 of the integer part of Ζ/Ν. He then computes the difference To = a\02... ak — A"
 and considers the number lC^nA"-1.

 (He then, looks for the integer Β of the division of Τοα^+ι... a*+« by 10"_1n A"-1,

 where α*+ι... α*+„ is the second (from the left) cycle of N, and Toajt+i... α*+„ is

 the concatenation of To and ak+1 · · · ak+n·)

 Amendment: He then, looks for the greatest integer Β such that g\(B) <
 %ak+\ ...ak+n, where α*+ι...α*+„ is the second (from the left) cycle of N,
 %ak+\... ak+n is the concatenation of To and ak+1... ak+n, and

 $!(!*) = φΐΟ^Α"-1*1 + ··· + ^ " JlO'A1*"-1 + QlO°A°fl".

 That number Β is the second digit of \/N. Now, Stevin computes the difference
 Τι = Τοα*+ι... ak+n —81(B), where ak+\. ■. ak+n is the second (from the left) cycle
 of N, and %ak+\... ak+n is the concatenation of To and α*+ι... ak+n. He then forms

 the number Tiat+„+i... ak+2n, where ak+n+i ■ · · a*+2n is the third (from the left)

 cycle of N, and 1\ak+„+\ ... ak+2n is the concatenation of Ti and ak+n+1 · · · α*+2η·

 (Then, as he did previously, he proceeds to find the number C as the integer part of

 the division of1iak+n+i ■ ■ -ak+2n by 10"_1n(Afl)"_1.)

 Amendment: Then, as he did previously, he proceeds to find the greatest integer

 C with the property g2(C) < Τια*+„+ι... ak+2n, where

 *2(C) = ^KV-^Afir^C1 + · · · + (n " JlO^A^C"-1

 This integer C is the third digit (from the left) of the integer part of y/N. His next

 step is to compute the difference T2 = Τια*+„+ι... ak+2n - 82(C) and he proceeds

 as before to find the next digit constituting the integer part of VN. One has to do so

 with the appropriate amendments in mind. He continues in this way until he gets all

 the digits of the integer part of y/N. The last difference is Tra-i, where is the

 4.2.2 Example

 In this example, we briefly discuss Stevin's method applied to the extraction of the

 fifth root of the number 44240899506197. He starts by making two columns of the

 9 digits and their fifth powers starting with 1 and ending with 9. On the other hand,

 he divides the number into cycles of 5 digits starting from the right. So, he gets

 the cycles 4424, 08995, and 06197. The first digit of fifth root of the number is the

 greatest integer Λ such that A5 < 4424. By looking at the table of fifth powers, he
 finds A = 5; 55 = 3125. He computes the difference To = 4424 - 3125 = 1299 and
 considers the number 129908995. Also, he considers A4 = 625 which he did compute

 to find the table of fifth powers, and then multiply 50000 · 625 = 31250000. This is

 just 104 · 5 · A4. Stevin would then divide 129908995/31250000 and take the integer

 part as the second digit of the fifth root. In this case, we will find 4 which is not the

 correct digit of the fifth root as seen from Al-Kashi's example above. So, we must

 work with the amended version and compute the whole quantity

 gl(B) = 104 · 5 · 54 · Β + 103 · 10 · 53 · Β2 + 102 · 10 · 52 · δ3 + 101 · 5 · 51 · B4

 +10° ■ 1 · 5° · B5.

 So, gi(B) = 31250000β + 1250000B2 + 25000J33 + 250B4 + Β5. Now, we look
 for the greatest integer Β such that g\(Β) < 129908995 which is found to be 3.
 Stevin's process can be continued in this way to find the third digit 6. The computa

 tion of the fractional part is similar to that of Al-Kashi and it is 414237741)281 ' Thus,

 y/·44240899506197 % 5364^55^^·

 5 Justification of the root extraction algorithms

 Our justification of Al-Kashi's square roots algorithm closely follows Berggren (1986).

 The same justification applies to Stevin's algorithm as well.

 Given an integer A, its digits are divided into groups of two, called "cycles" starting

 from the units digit. Let us assume, for the sake of illustration, that A is a 6-digit integer,

 say A = abcdef (the argument applies to integers of any number of digits). So, for

 a 6-digit number, the cycles are ab, cd, and ef. (If A was a 5-digit integer, the last

 cycle would have contained one digit). The cycles are useful because the first cycle
 counts the number of units in Α, the second cycle counts the number of 100's in Α,

 etc., and the numbers 1,100,10000 are perfect squares. This means we can regard A

 as A = ab ■ 104 + cd ■ 102 + ef ■ 10°. In the case, A is a perfect square, VÂ is another

 integer, otherwise it is an irrational number. Al-Kashi's algorithm finds the exact square

 root in the former case (say r = *J~N) and produces a rational number R = r%, where

 r, u, ν are positive integers, as an approximation to -J~N in the latter case which is much
 more common. His approximation is always an underestimation, that is R2 < N, when
 Ν is not a perfect square. He knows that r will contain 3 digits, say r = ABC. He
 determines the digits one at a time. The digit A is chosen as the largest digit such
 that A2 < ab. From this, it is not difficult to show that ((A + 1 ) 100)2 > N, which

 means A + 1 cannot be the hundreds digit of r. Then, he computes the difference
 D\ Ν — (A · 100)2 = (ab — A2) ■ 1002+cd ■ 102 +ef. To determine the next digit
 B, Al-Kashi notes that (100 · A + 10 · Β)2 must be as close to Ν as possible without
 exceeding it, i.e., the difference Ν — (100 · A + 10 · Β)2 must be positive and as small
 as possible. This difference can be written as Z>2 := D\ — (2A 10 + Β)Β ■ 100.
 In the execution of the algorithm with the help of a table, Al-Kashi makes use of
 this expression. Finally, he determines the units digit of r from the condition that
 Ν — (100 · A + 10 · β + C)2 must be positive and as small as possible. This quantity
 can be expressed as Dj Di — (2 · 100 · A + 2 · 10 · Β + C) · C. Al-Kashi takes
 advantage of the fact that previous differences are already computed in the table. He
 also makes use of place values to simplify certain computations.

 In obtaining the fractional part of the approximate square root, Al-Kashi uses a

 linear approximation. In the case when Ν is not a perfect square, it is clear that
 < Ν < (r + l)2, equivalently, r < -χ/ÏV < r + 1. Consider the secant line t to the
 curve y = sfx that goes through the points (r2, r) and ((r + l)2, r + 1). The idea of
 the approximation is to use the value on this line whose ^-coordinate is Ν (whereas
 the exact value lies on the curve y — ^/x with the same abscissa, see figure below.)

 The equation of this line is £(x) = r + fjrpy, hence t(N) = r + 2Γ+Ι · This is exactly
 what is obtained from the algorithm where r is the integer part. By doubling each new

 digit obtained, Al-Kashi keeps 2r in the bottom of the table. At the very end, he adds

 1 to that quantity because the 2r + 1 is required for this linear approximation. Note
 that since the function y = s/x is concave down, this secant line is below the curve,
 hence the approximation is an underestimate. Also, note that in the case when A is a

 perfect square, the fractional part will be 0, hence the exact value is obtained.

 It is actually possible to increase the accuracy of this approximation by using the

 identity tfN = ^^°"k and the fact that the difference between the curve y = ~Jx and
 the line y = ί(χ) on the interval [r2, (r + l)2] gets smaller as r (hence x) increases.

 In fact, it is easy to show that the maximum of the difference D{x) = */x - l{x) on
 the interval [r2, (r + l)2] is which goes to 0 as r -> oo. Hence, the error in the

 approximation can be made as small as desired by taking k large enough. According to

 Berggren (1986), the identity Z/~N = jqI0"* was known as early as al-Khwarizmi's
 time (d. 850 CE).

 The justification of the algorithm for higher order roots is very similar.

 6 Concluding remarks

 • In studying the methods of Al-Kashi and Stevin for extracting roots, we found

 that both mathematicians use a fine pedagogy with many examples and variations

 of the methods whenever possible. It is, however, often the case that what they

 call another method is actually just a variation in executing some of the steps of

 the same algorithm instead of it being a substantially new method or algorithm.

 Another noticeable similarity is the intentions of Al-Kashi and Stevin to write their

 arithmetic books for beginners and for real-life practitioners of other disciplines.

 • Concerning the root extraction per se, Al-Kashi and Stevin methods use the binomial

 expansion implicitly with Stevin making Pascal's triangle more apparent. We also

 found that neither of them explain or justify why their methods work. They only

 check that the roots found are the required roots.

 • Another similarity is the handling of the fractional part of the root. Both Al-Kashi

 and Stevin find the same fractional part with a small difference in the approach. It

 is, however, worth pointing out that the authors felt that Stevin did not fully grasp
 the addition of 1 to find the denominator because in his book Stevin (1625) on

 pages 117-118, he writes a note1 regarding this addition. He noticed that Nicolas

 Tartaglia does not add 1 while he does, just like Juan De Moya. He further argues

 with examples that it is better to add 1 rather than not to add 1, which suggests that

 Stevin did not see that the added 1 was coming from the expression (r+l)n—rn.

 • In Sect. 4.2.2, we provided a brief example of how to extract the fifth root, using

 Stevin's method, of the number 44240899506197 which was used by Al-Kashi. We

 did so to make it easy for the reader to compare Al-Kashi's and Stevin's methods as

 we did in previous examples. Actually, in Sect. 4.2.2, we could have used Stevin's

 number 3570467226624 to reach the same conclusion, namely that Stevin's method

 has some flaws and that the amended version works similarly to Al-Kashi's. It is

 true that, in example 16 (Stevin 1625, pp. 125-126), Stevin provides the tables of
 numbers and the correct fifth root of3570467226624, which is 324. One must notice

 1 Stevin (1625 p. 118) " ... by wanting to give a general rule (method), there is even more reason to add

 it than to leave it. It is true that there is no example which we can approximate it better by leaving it, but

 there also others which are to the contrary can be approached better by adding it."

 though that he does not provide his usual steps to find the root.2 Actually, if we

 follow his method as it was presented in the extraction of square roots, cube roots,

 and fourth roots, then we encounter the same problem in finding the second digit as

 discussed in Sect. 4 above. Given the correct setup and correct root in Stevin's work,

 it is the authors' opinion that Stevin may have not actually done all the computations

 and may have just used the fact that 3245 = 3570467226624. This is confirmed by

 the fact that Stevin computed, in his examples 8 and 9, -^34012224 = 324 and in his

 example 15, 1019960576 = 324 where his method, although flawed, gives the
 correct root. The fact that his tables in his example 16 are correct is understandable

 as Stevin's method has no problems in the setup and its relevant computations, but

 rather in the use of a simple division instead of a far more complex optimization to

 find the digits of the root after finding the first one.

 • Although decimal fractions are not our main focus in this work, it is interesting to

 note the following fact that adds another dimension to possible connections between

 Al-Kashi and Stevin. Reportedly, many historians held the view that Stevin was
 the first to introduce decimal fractions (O'Conner and Robertson 1999; Rashed

 1994), which was proven false when Luckey (1951) showed that in Miftah Al
 Kashi gives as clear a description of decimal fractions. However, Al-Kashi was

 not actually the original inventor of decimal fractions because according to best

 available records Al-Uqlidisi (around 952 CE) used them some five centuries before

 Al-Kashi (Berggren 1986; Saidan 1966, 1978). According to Berggren, "Stevin's

 awkward notation was nowhere near so good as Al-Uqlidisi's" (Berggren 1986).

 From what we have seen in the original works of Al-Kashi and Stevin and related

 facts about the origin of the root extraction reported by Rashed (1994), something

 similar to the development of decimal fractions may have taken place in the case
 of root extraction as well.

 • At last, but not the least, it is of particular interest to explore possible links between

 Al-Kashi and Stevin in light of the existence of many similarities.
