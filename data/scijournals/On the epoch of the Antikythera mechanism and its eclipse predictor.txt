 Abstract The eclipse predictor (or Saros dial) of the Antikythera mechanism provides

 a wealth of astronomical information and offers practically the only possibility for a

 close astronomical dating of the mechanism. We apply a series of constraints, in a sort

 of sieve of Eratosthenes, to sequentially eliminate possibilities for the epoch date. We

 find that the solar eclipse of month 13 of the Saros dial almost certainly belongs to

 solar Saros series 44. And the eclipse predictor would work best if the full Moon of

 month 1 of the Saros dial corresponds to May 12,205 BCE, with the exeligmos dial set

 at 0. We also examine some possibilities for the theory that underlies the eclipse times

 on the Saros dial and find that a Babylonian-style arithmetical scheme employing

 an equation of center and daily velocities would match the inscribed times of day

 quite well. Indeed, an arithmetic scheme for the eclipse times matches the evidence

 somewhat better than does a trigonometric model.

 1 Introduction

 Lunar eclipses were predicted with reasonable accuracy by the Babylonians using the

 Saros cycle, involving a schematic distribution in the arrangement 8-8-7-8-7- (Steele

 2000a). Here, each 8 represents a group or sequence of eight eclipses at 6-month

 intervals. And each 7 represents a sequence of seven eclipses at 6-month intervals. The

 last eclipse of any 8 or 7 group is separated from the first eclipse of the following group

 by only a 5-month interval. Thus, the locations of the 5-month intervals are indicated

 by the hyphens. The total number of lunar eclipses in one cycle is 8+8+7+8+7 = 38,

 and the duration of the cycle of 38 lunar eclipses is 47 + 47 + 41 + 47 + 41 = 223

 synodic months. Of course, this is a cycle, so the starting point is arbitrary. Thus, one

 can also have lunar eclipses in the patterns 8-7-8-7-8- or 7-8-7-8-8-, for example. And

 in an actual sequence of predicted eclipses, it is by no means necessary to start at the

 beginning of an 8 or a 7 group. Solar eclipses were also predicted by the Babylonians

 using the same sort of 8-8-7-8-7- scheme. Perhaps we should refer to these as solar

 eclipse possibilities (EP), for in Babylonian astronomy there was no reliable way to

 determine which solar eclipses would actually be visible from Babylon.1

 The Antikythera mechanism (AM) is a Greek geared astronomical computing
 machine, built sometime between the late third century and the early first century

 BCE, which was recovered from an ancient shipwreck in 1901. A remarkable feature

 of a recent study by Freeth et al. (2008) is a demonstration that eclipses were predicted

 on the lower back dial of the mechanism by means of the Saros cycle. Only a small

 portion of the inscriptions on the Saros dial are preserved. Nevertheless, Freeth et al.

 were able to show that the predictive scheme is consistent with a Babylonian-style

 8-8-7-8-7- pattern. The reconstruction is greatly aided by the presence of index letters

 in the glyphs for the eclipses. Each month box that bears an eclipse glyph is labeled by

 a Greek letter that shows where the glyph stands in the sequence. Thus, even though

 a large chunk of the dial is missing, it is possible to be sure exactly how many eclipse

 glyphs would have been carried by most of the missing part of the dial. Freeth et al.

 attempted a fit of the eclipses inscribed on the Antikythera mechanism, in an effort

 to determine which year or years might best correspond to the first year of the Saros

 dial. This would be one important approach, among several, to dating the mechanism.

 Other methods include archeological dating of the ship's other cargo, radiocarbon dat

 ing of the ship's timbers, and the dating of the Greek inscriptions on the mechanism by

 means of the forms of the letters. Of course, the first two of these do not directly give

 any information about the mechanism itself, while the third (dating by letter forms)

 has an uncertainty of perhaps as much as plus or minus a century. The Saros dial is

 practically the only astronomical feature of the mechanism that could possibly afford

 a more tightly constrained dating.

 1 The Babylonians had no way to treat the lunar parallax. Some writers characterize also the lunar eclipses
 in a Saros scheme as "eclipse possibilities." The advantage of this usage is that it acknowledges that the

 Babylonian astronomers knew that sometimes a predicted lunar eclipse does not occur or that sometimes

 one occurs in the wrong month. Still, the prediction of lunar eclipses was pretty accurate, so to describe
 these predictions as giving mere possibilities seems an unduly positivistic characterization of what the
 Babylonians were up to.

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 695

 In their analysis of the mechanism's Saros dial, Freeth et al. fitted the extant eclipse

 glyphs to modern computed eclipse data. A great deal of uncertainty is involved in

 deciding what to do about penumbral eclipses, easily predicted by modern theory, but

 rarely if ever mentioned by ancient astronomers. If they did not allow any penumbral

 eclipses to be counted as corresponding to glyphs on the mechanism, Freeth et al. found

 that they had no possible epoch dates. If, on the other hand, they allowed themselves

 the flexibility of counting an occasional penumbral eclipse as one of the Babylonian

 eclipse possibilities, they found they had over a hundred possible fits for epoch date.

 Clearly, one would like a result in between these two outcomes.

 In this paper we shall offer a fresh analysis of the eclipses predicted on the Saros

 dial of the Antikythera mechanism, with the goal of establishing the epoch year for

 this feature of the mechanism. By epoch year we mean the starting year or "year 1"

 from which the ancient mechanic reckoned time for the purpose of the mechanism's

 display. The epoch is not necessarily the same as the date of manufacture, though it

 would be surprising if they were very widely separated in time.

 Our working hypothesis is that the Antikythera mechanism's eclipse glyphs should

 be fitted, not to modern computations of eclipses, but to Babylonian practice. Such

 an analysis has the advantage of removing the spurious penumbral eclipses from

 consideration. Moreover, the 8-8-7-8-7- scheme is far from perfect: it can predict an

 eclipse that does not actually occur, fail to predict an eclipse that does occur, or predict

 an eclipse for the wrong month. Thus, it is a fallacy to suppose that the epoch of the

 Antikythera mechanism's Saros dial could be reliably determined simply by matching

 its predictions against real eclipses. Although it is a priori likely that the Babylonian

 Saros scheme was the ultimate source for the predictive scheme represented on the
 mechanism, one should not simply assume this without scrutiny. We shall present

 evidence below that the eclipse prediction scheme on the Antikythera mechanism

 really does derive from the Babylonian example.

 Of course, in parts of our analysis, we shall make considerable use of theoretically
 computed phenomena, such as nodal distances and eclipse times. We will show that

 it is possible to introduce constraints sequentially, as with a sort of "sieve of Eratos

 thenes," to systematically restrict the number of possible solutions. The tools at our

 disposal include as follows: the distributions of the solar and lunar eclipse glyphs on

 the Antikythera mechanism, which may be fitted to Babylonian patterns in a number

 of different ways; the connection between the solar and lunar patterns, which may

 be compared with similar connections in the Babylonian material; the "omitted solar

 eclipses" (defined below), which may be used to classify the solar eclipses and to

 establish their places in the 8-8-7-8-7- sequence without ambiguity; nodal elonga

 tions, which may be used to narrow the range of fits; eclipse times, which may be

 used to restrict the solutions to a single Saros eclipse series, and even to rule out two

 fits of every three in that series. When these approaches are used in conjunction, it is

 possible to arrive at a single most likely epoch for the eclipse predictor.

 2 Terminology

 We use "8-" to stand for the run of 47 synodic months beginning with the month

 in which occurs the first eclipse of an 8-eclipse group. In the following pictorial

 representation of an 8-, each E; denotes a month with a (say, lunar) eclipse and each

 x denotes a month without an eclipse:

 E i XXXXXE2XXXXXE3 XXXXXE4XXXXXE5 xxxxxE6XxxxxE7 xxxxxEg xxxx.

 Sometimes, it is convenient to talk about time intervals between eclipses: We shall use

 "interval" to mean a time difference. Thus, from lunar eclipse Ej to lunar eclipse E2 is

 an interval of six synodic months. From Es to the first eclipse of the following group
 is an interval of 5 months. On the other hand, it is often convenient to count actual

 months, and we shall use "gap" to indicate a run of empty, eclipseless months. Thus,

 the gap between the months containing Ei and E2 consists of five months, while the

 gap between the months containing Es and the following eclipse consists of 4 months.

 "8" stands for the group of 8 eclipses, but not counting the four empty months at

 the end. Thus, an 8 begins with an eclipse and ends with an eclipse. An 8 is 43 months

 long:

 long:

 ExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxE.

 "7-" represents the interval from the first eclipse of a 7-eclipse group though the

 four empty months after the last eclipse of the group. A 7- is 41 months long:

 ExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxx.

 "7" is the same, but without the four empty months at the end. A 7 is 37 months

 ExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxExxxxxE.

 A number of different concepts involve the term "Saros," so we should take a

 moment to make their meanings clear. Here, we follow the definitions of Steele (2000a,

 p. 424). By "Saros cycle," we mean the period of 223 synodic months containing 38

 eclipse possibilities. A "Saros scheme" will mean a particular distribution of eclipse
 possibilities within a Saros cycle. Different Saros schemes were used by the Baby

 lonian astronomers, as the 8-8-7-8-7- distribution of eclipses needed to be re-calibrated

 from time to time, to maintain fidelity to the phenomena. By "Saros series," we refer to

 a collection of eclipse possibilities, each separated by one Saros cycle of 223 synodic

 months from the preceding eclipse possibility. If a solar eclipse takes place this month,

 then another, with similar characteristics, will occur 223 months from now. These two

 eclipses are part of a single series, which may be assigned a standard number. One

 speaks of solar Saros series 46, for example.

 A single Saros series may persist for 1,200 years or more. At any moment in his

 tory, about 40 Saros series are in progress. Each eclipse can be labeled by its Saros

 series number in the standard catalogs of Espenak (Five Millennium Catalog of Solar

 Eclipses; Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipses). Saros series of solar eclipses

 are given even numbers if they occur near the descending node of the Moon's orbit

 and odd numbers if they occur near the ascending node. When a new solar Saros series

 begins at the descending node, the new Moon occurs about 18° east of the descending

 node (and so below the ecliptic). A partial eclipse of the Sun will be visible from

 southern parts of the Earth—just the northern limb of the Sun will be grazed. At pro

 gressively later eclipses in the same series, the Sun will be centrally eclipsed, and

 then, gradually this Saros series will disappear off the south limb of the Sun (Espenak,

 Eclipses, and the Saros). Lunar Saros series have odd numbers if the eclipses occur

 with the Moon near the descending node of its orbit and even numbers if they occur

 with the Moon near the ascending node.

 The reason for the finite lifetime of a Saros series is that the Saros relation 223

 synodic months (sm) = 242 draconic months (dm) is not exact. A more precise corre

 spondence is 223 sm = 241.99868 dm (Smart 1977, p. 420). Thus, when 223 synodic

 months have elapsed, the time elapsed in draconic months is <242 by 0.00132 dm,

 which corresponds to 0.475° of mean motion with respect to the node. That is, from

 one eclipse to the next in the same Saros series, the position of the mean conjunction

 moves westward by about 0.475°. Now, the Sun's ecliptic limits from the node for a

 solar eclipse to be possible vary from a maximum of about 18.4° to a minimum of

 about 15.4° (Smart 1977, p. 390). Let us take 17° as a round value. The width of the

 nodal zone is thus 34°; the position of the mean conjunction recedes by about 0.475°

 per Saros and so takes roughly 72 Saros cycles to cross the whole nodal zone, which

 amounts to about 1,300 years. If about 40 Saros series are in progress, on the aver

 age, at any one time, then a Saros series must end (and another must begin) roughly

 every 1,300/40 = 33 years or so. This is one reason why the Babylonian astronomers

 needed to re-calibrate their Saros eclipse scheme from time to time.

 3 The lunar eclipse pattern on the Antikythera mechanism

 The 14 lunar eclipses attested on the surviving portion of the dial are in month cells
 20,26,61,67,79,114,120,125,131,137,172,178,184, and 190.2 These are the data

 that a Babylonian 8-8-7-8-7- eclipse distribution must match. Freeth et al. argued that

 only a single possible reconstruction was consistent with the preserved lunar eclipse

 glyphs and index letters. Actually, there are two possible lunar eclipse patterns, which

 2 Original publication of the eclipse glyphs is then known: (Freeth et al. 2008). These (both the journal

 article and the online Supplementary Notes) contained some errors in the presentation of the eclipse data.

 These have been corrected in a new version of the Supplementary Notes posted at http://www.nature.com/

 nature/journal/v454/n7204/extre£/nature07130-sl.pdf, to which readers should now refer. (Most of these
 errors were corrected by Beatriz Bandeira of the Universidad Nacional Très de Febrero of Argentina).

 We have taken the times of the eclipses from the most recent analysis made by Alexander Jones in a still

 unpublished paper. They differ in some cases from the times published in the Supplementary Notes of Freeth

 et al. (2008). The following differences should be noted. We list first the eclipse cell and eclipse type, then

 the reading of Freeth et al., and finally Jones's reading. 13S: day 1 or 4, day 1. 78S: night 1, day 1.120M:

 day 8, day 6.172M: no reading, night 6.172S: no reading, day 12.178S: most unclear, day 9. In all cases,

 we followed Jones's readings. We excluded from the time analysis three eclipses: 120M because Jones's

 reading is uncertain and 67S and 72H because the reading is incomplete. For SI 19 both Jones and Feeth et

 al. 2008 readi[ ] which could be 10,11 or 12, so we assume the mean value, 11. A lunar eclipse in month

 61 has recently been discovered (Anastasiou et al. 2014). Our eclipse analysis was completed before this

 discovery was made; but the new glyph fit right into the already reconstructed Babylonian pattern with no
 changes required.

 are displayed in Table 1. The lunar pattern that we call a was identified by Freeth et

 al. The other possible solution we will call lunar pattern ß. (See "Appendix 1" for an

 explanation).

 In the first column of Table 1, the eclipse possibilities for one Saros period are

 labeled from 1 to 38. The next two columns illustrate the features of lunar pattern a.

 The month in which each EP falls is listed in column two, the months being numbered

 from the first cell of the Antikythera mechanism's Saros dial. Cell numbers in bold type

 indicate surviving lunar eclipse inscriptions. The cell numbers written in parentheses

 are the other eclipse possibilities predicted by pattern a. The third column shows

 the grouping of eclipses into a 7-8-7-8-8- pattern. Note that, in this case, the first

 7- group is not complete, as only six of the eclipses appear at the beginning of the

 chart. Alternatively, one may think of this 7- group as beginning with an eclipse at

 month 219 of the previous Saros cycle. The 5-month intervals are indicated by the

 heavy bars. The beginning of the double 8- group is indicated by the doubled heavy
 bar.

 Lunar pattern ß (in the pattern 8-8-7-8-7-) is displayed in the final two columns.

 Note that the only difference between these two solutions occurs in the 37th eclipse

 possibility: In pattern a, this eclipse falls in month 214, while in pattern ß it falls in

 month 213. The cells for eclipse possibility 37 are shaded to indicate that the month

 number of this eclipse differs between the two patterns. As there are no visible glyphs

 beyond month 190, both possibilities are consistent with the evidence. We shall keep

 both options open for the time being.

 Conclusion of Sect. 3: Two patterns, a and. ß, are consistent with the preserved
 lunar eclipse glyphs and with a Babylonian-style 8-8-7-8-7- eclipse scheme.

 4 The solar eclipse pattern on the Antikythera mechanism

 The Babylonians used a similar 8-8-7-8-7- distribution to obtain possibilities for solar

 eclipses. On the Saros dial of the Antikythera mechanism, solar EPs are inscribed in
 months 13, 25, 72,78, 119, 125, 131, 137,172,178, and 184. Freeth et al. identified

 one 8-8-7-8-7- distribution scheme of solar eclipses consistent with the extant glyphs.

 But there are actually seven different 8-8-7-8-7- schemes consistent with the extant
 glyphs. These are illustrated in Table 2. (See "Appendix 2" for an explanation of
 how we arrive at these solutions). As before, the extant eclipse glyphs are indicated

 in bold type. The 5-month intervals (4-month gaps) for each solution are indicated

 by the heavy bars. The beginning of the double 8- group is indicated by the double

 bar. In Table 2, the solar eclipses that can come in a variable month (dependent on

 which of the seven patterns is actually represented on the Antikythera mechanism)

 are shaded. The un-shaded eclipses would occur in the same months, no matter which

 of the seven patterns was actually used. Taking the solar and lunar solutions together,

 there are therefore 14 solutions for placement of the eclipses on the Saros dial that

 are consistent with the preserved inscriptions and with Babylonian-style 8-8-7-8-7
 schemes, which we call la, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, Iß, 2ß, 3ß, 4ß, 5ß, 6ß, and Iß.

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 701

 Conclusion of Sect. 4: Seven patterns, 1-7, are consistent with the preserved solar

 eclipse glyphs and with a Babylonian-style 8-8-7-8-7- eclipse scheme. There are

 therefore 14 ways to reconstruct the Saros dial.

 S Britton, Steele, and alternative Steele rules for linking solar and lunar

 patterns

 Babylonian practice favored linking a solar eclipse pattern to a lunar eclipse pattern,

 which could perhaps allow us to discard some solar patterns or, at least, to prefer

 the others. These links have been discussed by Britton and by Steele, with somewhat
 different results.

 Britton (1989, pp. 21-24) described the relationship between lunar and solar

 eclipses in these terms: When the Moon pattern is 8-8-7-8-7, the Sun pattern is 7

 8-7-8-8 (exactly the reverse) but starts three eclipse possibilities earlier.3 So, if we are

 given one lunar eclipse pattern, we automatically have the corresponding solar pattern.
 We will call this the Britton rule.

 But Steele (2000a, p. 443) has proposed another rule: "There is in fact an even closer

 link between the lunar and solar Saroi, at least in the period after -250. From here
 until at least -70, it would seem that the solar and lunar Saroi have the same 8-7-8-7-8

 distribution, with the solar Saros always starting 4 eclipse possibilities earlier than the

 lunar Saros." So, according to Steele, when the Moon pattern is 8-7-8-7-8, the Sun

 pattern is the same, 8-7-8-7-8, but starts 4 EP earlier. We will call this the Steele rule.

 According to Steele, the differing results may be accounted for by the different input

 information: "Britton's rule is derived from a theoretical model of nodal elongation

 (proposed by Aaboe) and (I think) agrees with what we find on the so-called Saros
 Canon texts, which are a small group of theoretical texts from Babylon. The rule I
 gave is based upon actual preserved records of eclipse predictions and observations

 found in Babylonian texts. Thus, Britton's rule is a theoretical rule (reflecting also a

 particular Babylonian theory), whereas my rule is a reflection of what the Babylonians

 did in practice" (John Steele, personal communication).

 In practice, the Babylonians re-calibrated their Saros schemes from time to time,

 when they got too far out of synchrony with the eclipse phenomena. Re-calibration

 involves a discontinuity in the run of repeating 8-8-7-8-7- patterns (the details will

 be discussed below). Once a re-calibration had occurred, the scheme typically could

 run for 2-5 Saros cycles without readjustment. Often, the Babylonian re-calibration

 occurred a few Saros cycles later than we might judge to be ideal, which means that

 some time had to elapse before the Babylonian astronomers perceived that the errors in

 the eclipse predictions had built up sufficiently so that re-calibration was required. As

 we shall see, the successive Babylonian re-calibrations of the Saros provide a useful

 dating tool.

 3 This is also discussed in Aaboe et al. (1991, p. 17).

 On rare occasions, it is possible that the scheme for solar eclipses was re-calibrated,

 but the scheme for lunar eclipses was left unchanged for some time.4 In such instances,

 what we shall call the alternative Steele rule would be in force, as it is effectively a
 different form of the Steele rule. When the alternative Steele rule is in effect, the solar

 and lunar Saros schemes have the same 8-7-8-7-8- distribution as one another, but with

 the solar scheme always starting 4 eclipse possibilities later than the lunar scheme.

 We do not know whether this was a genuine rule of Babylonian eclipse theory—it

 could have resulted simply from correcting the solar calibration but leaving the lunar

 calibration unchanged for a time. Historically, the alternative Steele rule seems to have

 been in effect from about -71 at least to the end of the first century BCE. It may also

 have happened that the alternative Steele rule was in effect from time to time for shorter

 stretches, as we do not know exactly when all the recalibrations were performed.5

 Babylonian tabulations of lunar and solar eclipses are typically found on different

 tablets—it is not common to find them in one document. Therefore, a Greek astronomer

 could also unwittingly arrive at the alternative Steele rule if he made use of a canon

 of solar eclipses and a canon of lunar eclipses that ran for an overlapping sequence of

 years, if the solar canon represented a post-recalibration sequence and the lunar canon

 represented a pre-recalibration sequence. We might expect it to be more likely that

 such a circumstance would obtain shortly after a Babylonian recalibration.

 As we have seen, two lunar eclipse schemes, a and ß, are consistent with the extant

 lunar eclipse glyphs; and seven solar eclipse schemes, numbered 1 through 7, are
 consistent with the extant solar eclipse glyphs. Thus, we have 2 x 7 = 14 possi
 bilities for the combined solution. However, if the eclipse scheme on the Antikythera

 mechanism's Saros dial incorporates one of the possible Babylonian links between the

 solar and lunar patterns, there may be fewer viable alternatives. It is an easy matter to

 examine each of the 14 possible combinations to determine which, if any, is consistent

 with the Britton, Steele, or alternative Steele rules. We obtain the following results:

 Britton rule If Lunar Pattern a and Solar Pattern 7 are represented on the Antikythera

 mechanism, these would be connected by the Britton rule.

 If Lunar Pattern ß and Solar Pattern 6 are represented on the mechanism, these would

 be connected by the Britton rule.

 Steele rule If Lunar Pattern a and Solar Pattern 6 are represented on the mechanism,

 these would be connected by the Steele rule.

 If Lunar Pattern ß and Solar Pattern 2 are represented on the mechanism, these would

 be connected by the Steele rule.

 4 That is, one modifies the solar Saros scheme without modifying the lunar scheme, in such a way that

 the solar scheme that began 4 EP earlier than the lunar one now begins 4 EP later than the lunar one. This

 could sound odd if one supposes that the solar schemes originated as modifications of the lunar schemes.

 Why would you recalibrate the solar and not the lunar if the solar is based on the lunar? But it seems that

 in the case of re-calibration the dependence is in the other direction. Steele (2000a, p. 443) suggests that

 one particular lunar recalibration, in -110, was unnecessary but nevertheless took place to coincide with a

 solar re-calibration. He also suggests that "Since solar eclipses can occur at greater nodal elongations than

 lunar eclipses, it was necessary to revise the solar Saros scheme more often than the lunar Saros."

 5 For example, Steele (2000a, p. 442) points out that the circumstances of the -110 recalibration are not

 completely clear.

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 703

 Alternative Steele rule If Lunar Pattern ß and Solar Pattern 7 are represented on the

 mechanism, these would be connected by the alternative Steele rule.

 So, instead of 14 combinations, we have only five (2ß, 6a, 6/3,7a, and Iß) that should

 perhaps be preferred. In particular, none of solar patterns 1,3,4,5 is consistent with

 any version of the Babylonian linking convention.

 We might expect the Antikythera mechanism to reflect the Steele or alternative

 Steele rules, as these are deduced from what the Babylonian astronomers did in prac

 tice, rather than the Britton rule, which reflects a particular set of Babylonian theo

 retical texts. In particular, we might expect the alternative Steele rule to show up if

 the mechanism was designed after -71, or if it was designed at some earlier date but

 shortly after a Babylonian re-calibration of the solar Saros. However, at this stage, we

 leave all possibilities open—Steele, alternative Steele, or Britton rule, or something

 else entirely.

 Conclusion of Sect. 5 : Babylonian practice favored linking a solar eclipse scheme

 to a lunar eclipse scheme. Steele and Britton have published different versions of

 these rules. The Steele rule or the alternative Steele rule should be preferred since

 they reflect actual Babylonian eclipse records for the period covering the likely

 date of manufacture of the AM. Some, but not all, of the 14 solutions mentioned
 in Sect. 4 are consistent with the Steele or with the Britton rule. However, we do

 not use any of the linking rules to eliminate solutions.

 6 Node conventions: a basic link between solar and lunar patterns

 A key historical fact is that in the Babylonian records stretching over hundreds of

 years, a solar eclipse that is considered to begin the 8-8- double group is generally
 an eclipse at the descending node of the Moon's orbit. To confirm this, we have

 computed the argument of the latitude of the Moon (Moon's mean distance from the

 ascending node)6 at each eclipse beginning a solar double 8- in the Babylonian eclipse

 record published by Steele. For actually occurring eclipses, we input the time of the

 midpoint of the eclipse, taken from the Espenak catalog. For eclipses predicted in the

 Babylonian Saros scheme but not actually occurring, we used the time of conjunction.

 This analysis confirms that we are dealing with a reliable Babylonian convention,

 carefully preserved across multiple recalibrations. The Saros cycle contains an even

 number (38) of solar EPs, so placing one Saros cycle after another does not disrupt

 the regular alternation between the ascending and descending nodes. As we shall

 see below, when re-calibrations of the Saros were required, this was usually done by

 inserting a 47-month cycle (with 8 solar EPs) between the ending of one Saros cycle

 and the beginning of another. Such a recalibration also did not disrupt the regular
 alternation between the nodes.

 6 For the Moon's argument of latitude (the mean angular distance of the Moon from its ascending node),
 see (Meeus 2009, p. 338, Eq. 47.5). In our calculations, we used an Excel program, based on Meeus's
 formula, written by Dennis Duke.

 An even simpler way to see the pattern is the following. It is somewhat easier to work

 with the first eclipse of the second 8- in a 8-8- double group. (This is because the Saros

 series involving the first eclipse of the first 8- in the double 8- often ended, but was

 continued for some time by the Babylonians, before they realized that a re-calibration

 was in order. Hence, a number of these predicted eclipses did not actually occur, so

 their Saros series numbers are undefined). Here, we give samples of solar eclipses,
 each of which is a first eclipse of the second 8- in a 8-8- in Steele's reconstruction

 of the Babylonian eclipse records. These are accompanied by their solar Saros series
 number:7

 As we can see, the solar eclipse beginning the second 8- of an 8-8- always belongs

 to an even-numbered solar Saros series—and is therefore an eclipse at the descending

 node. The same is therefore true of the first eclipse of the first 8- of the double 8-. During

 the course of a recalibration, it is not always easy to decide where to put the divisions

 between the 8- groups and the 7- groups. This is because the eclipse records are spotty:

 Only isolated eclipse dates are actually preserved and only in a limited number of cases

 do we have an explicit statement that a particular eclipse was preceded by a 5-month

 interval. But whenever the Babylonian 8-8-7-8-7- scheme is running regularly, the

 pattern seems to hold, that the second 8- of a double 8- begins with a solar eclipse at the

 descending node—and this over the whole period that is possible for the construction

 of the Antikythera mechanism.

 A similar examination of Steele's list of Babylonian lunar eclipses shows that in the

 case of lunar eclipses, but only after about -250, the first eclipse of a double-8 group

 always occurs with the Moon at the ascending node of its orbit. Around —260, a major

 recalibration occurred, in which the first lunar eclipse of an 8-8- moved from odd lunar

 Saros series to even ones. This was apparently connected with adoption of the Steele
 rule, which, as we saw above, went into effect around -250. From the middle of the

 third century BCE down to the end of Steele's table at the beginning of the first century

 CE (and so for the whole period in which the Antikythera mechanism might have been

 constructed), the first lunar eclipse of an 8-8- remained at the ascending node.

 7 The groupings of eclipses into 8-8-7-8-7s are from Steele (2009, Table 4). The Saros series numbers for
 these eclipses come from Espenak (Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses).

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 705

 Moreover, this is a logical consequence of the Steele rule. Suppose that there were a

 cycle in which a solar eclipse fell at the start of a double-8 and that there was also a lunar

 eclipse this same month. Because it is the start of a solar double-8, we know the Moon

 was at the descending node at the solar eclipse; therefore, the Moon was at the ascend

 ing node at the lunar eclipse of the same month. But the lunar double-8 would start 4

 EPs later or earlier (in the Steele or alternative Steele rules, respectively). 4 is an even

 number, so the Moon must also be at the ascending node that starts the lunar double-8.

 Again, here are some examples from Steele's reconstruction—selected lunar

 eclipses that start the second 8- of a 8-8-group:

 Lunar Saros series have even numbers if they occur with the Moon near its ascending

 node. Thus, the lunar eclipses beginning the second 8- of an 8-8- have the Moon at the

 ascending node. The same is true of the lunar eclipses beginning the first 8-. Again, in

 the course of the recalibrations, things can be unclear. But when the system is running

 normally, each lunar 8-8- starts with an eclipse in which the Moon is at its ascending
 node.

 Now, if we assume that the eclipse predictor on the AM represents Babylonian prac

 tice, then at the first eclipse of the solar double 8- the Moon must be at its descending

 node and at the first eclipse of the lunar double 8- the Moon must be at its ascending

 node. We may thin out the 14 solutions by imposing this requirement. In Table 3,

 for each of the seven solar solutions, we require the first eclipse of the double-8 (the

 eclipse immediately following the heavy double line) to have the Moon at the descend

 ing node D. For example, solar pattern 5 has the first eclipse of the 8-8- in month 7,

 and this is marked D. Then, alternating D and A, we may easily fill out the rest of the

 column. For lunar pattern a, the 8-8- begins with month 125, and this is marked A:

 The Moon must be at its ascending node at the time of this lunar eclipse. Again, the

 rest of the pattern may be filled put by alternating A, D, A, D

 Key are the months that have both solar and lunar eclipses: These are months 125,

 131, 137, 172, 178, and 184. The requirements of the Babylonian conventions are

 highlighted in these months. Then, we may easily cross solar patterns against lunar

 patterns to see which combinations are permissible. We will use month 125 as our

 example, but any one of these 6 months would suffice. In month 125, solar pattern

 7 requires the Moon to be at A for the solar eclipse; and lunar pattern ß requires

 the Moon to be at D for the lunar eclipse of the same month. These are compatible

 requirements, since, in the 2 weeks from the lunar to the solar eclipse, the Moon will

 move to the opposite node. Thus, combination Iß is permissible.

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 707

 By contrast, combination la is ruled out: Solar pattern 1 requires the Moon to be at

 A for the solar eclipse of month 125, while lunar pattern a requires the Moon also to

 be at A for the lunar eclipse of the same month. These are incompatible requirements.

 By such examinations, it is easy to see that combinations la, 2a, 3/1,4a, 5/3,6/5,
 and 7a are all eliminated. Combinations 1/5, 2/5, 3a, Aß, 5a, 6a, and Iß are still pos
 sible.

 We note that the Britton rule combinations 6/5 and 7a are excluded. The Britton rule

 is not compatible with the Babylonian convention, attested in the Saros record from

 about -250 onward, of starting a solar 8-8- with the Moon at D for the solar eclipse and

 starting a lunar 8-8- with the Moon at A for the lunar eclipse.8 The node conventions,

 while less restrictive than the Steele rule, are compatible with seven possible solutions,

 including two (2/5 and 6a) consistent with the Steele rule and one {Iß) consistent with
 the alternative Steele rule.

 Moreover, it is possible to prove that the node conventions are necessarily linked

 to the Steele and Britton rules. Having the 8-8- of the solar eclipses start at D and the

 8-8- of the lunar eclipses start at A automatically entails either the Steele or alternative

 Steele rules. But having the 8-8- of the solar eclipses start at D and the 8-8- of the lunar

 eclipses also start at D automatically results in the Britton rule. This is demonstrated

 in "Appendix 6."

 Conclusion of Sect. 6: In the Babylonian eclipse records, over the whole period

 that is conceivable for the manufacture of the Antikythera mechanism, the solar

 eclipse that begins the 8-8- (in the 8-8-7-8-7- pattern for the solar eclipses)

 came at the descending node D. And the lunar eclipse that began the 8-8- of the

 lunar eclipse pattern came with the Moon at the ascending node A. Invoking this

 condition eliminates half of the 14 solutions mentioned in Sect. 4. Moreover, the
 Britton rule is eliminated.

 7 The omitted solar eclipses as a tool for the classification of solar eclipses

 In a Babylonian Saros scheme, equal numbers of solar and lunar eclipse possibilities

 are generated—38 each in a 223-month cycle. However, on the Antikythera mech
 anism, fewer solar eclipses were included than lunar eclipses. Freeth et al. (2008)

 argued convincingly that this is connected with the idea that if a new Moon occurred

 too far south of the node of the Moon's orbit, the ancient astronomer may not have

 considered the eclipse to be visible. Although this practice has not yet been found

 in the Babylonian material, a similar idea is mentioned in Ptolemy's Almagest (vi,

 5), where it is connected with lunar parallax effects. According to Ptolemy, a lunar

 eclipse will generally occur if the mean Moon, when in opposition to the Sun, lies

 within 15°12' of the node (Toomer 1984, p. 287). However, the cutoff criterion for

 solar eclipses is asymmetric: A solar eclipse will generally appear for the northern

 8 However, the Britton rule could have been compatible with Babylonian practice before about -260: As

 we have seen, during the earlier period, while a solar 8-8- began with the Moon at D for the solar eclipse,

 the lunar 8-8- also began with the Moon at D for the lunar eclipse.

 inhabited latitudes of the Earth if at the time of conjunction the center of the true
 Moon is no more than 17°41' north of the node, or no more than 8°22' south of the

 node, measured along the Moon's inclined path (Toomer 1984, p. 286). (Ptolemy goes
 on to add that the cutoffs for the center of the mean Moon are: 20°41' to the north

 of the node or 11°22' to the south). Although the Almagest is several centuries later

 than the Antikythera mechanism, it is not unreasonable to suppose that similar rules

 governing solar eclipses were in place earlier. Freeth et al. showed that, for rather

 narrow ranges of the three cutoff parameters (limit of lunar, limit of northern solar,

 and limit of southern solar eclipses), the predictions of their generating scheme (based

 on the mean motions of the Saros cycle plus an asymmetric criterion for elongation
 from the node) can indeed match the evidence. These authors also remarked that "it

 does not appear to be possible to generate the Antikythera scheme [of solar eclipses]

 by a simple pattern of excisions from one of the Babylonian schemes" (Freeth et al.

 2008, Supplementary Notes, p. 36). Finally, Freeth et al. experimented with schemes

 that incorporate the first anomalies of the Sun's and Moon's motion; but these did

 not lead to any real improvement in the simpler scheme based on mean motion and

 asymmetric cutoffs.

 However, we suggest that since the original EPs simply follow the schematic 8-8-7

 8-7- pattern, it may be questioned whether an elaborate month-by-month calculation

 of nodal elongation (whether based on mean or true positions) lies behind the pattern

 of excluded solar eclipses. This would have made the suppression of occasional solar

 eclipses far more work than the original listing of eclipse possibilities for the Sun and

 Moon. We shall show that a simple system for omission of unwanted solar eclipses is

 probably possible. The basic rule is: at each node, omit the southernmost eclipse in
 each "diagonal sequence." (This term will be defined below).

 In Fig. 1, we display the positions of the solar eclipse glyphs from the Saros dial—

 but arrange them instead on a replica of the Metonic calendar spiral. The synodic
 months are numbered here and there for convenience. Parallelograms mark the solar

 eclipse possibilities that are actually preserved on the mechanism. We place the eclipse

 symbols consecutively, with the first preserved solar EP falling at month 13, as on
 the mechanism's Saros dial. As we have just seen, seven different reconstructions are

 consistent with the extant solar glyphs and the Babylonian node conventions: In Fig. 1,

 we follow solar pattern 7. Patterns 1-6 would give slightly different diagrams, though

 the positions of the parallelograms would be the same in all. The circles in Fig. 1 mark

 the locations of solar eclipse possibilities that are called for by pattern 7, but that are

 in fact missing from the Saros dial. The double bar in Fig. 1 indicates the beginning of

 the 8-8- in solar pattern 7; therefore, the Moon must be at D for the first solar eclipse

 following this double bar (month 13). Let us start reckoning from this moment in the

 Saros cycle. This eclipse is therefore labeled Di, and all the remaining eclipses may

 be labeled D and A alternately. The tendency of eclipses to radial grouping is striking

 in Fig. 1. This results from two facts. First, there is a near equivalence between the
 Saros (223 sm = 242 dm) and a shorter 47-month eclipse cycle (47 sm = 51 dm) that

 is also attested in the Babylonian material. Second, the 47-month cycle is contained an

 even number of times (five times) in a 235-month Metonic cycle. Eclipse possibilities

 occurring near the descending node are labeled, sequentially in time, Di, D2, D3, D4,
 with Di the most northerly. (We will explain below how we know which is most

 northerly). Eclipse possibilities occurring near the ascending node are labeled Aj,
 A2, A3, A4, with A] being the most southerly. Note that the orientations of the radial

 spokes are preserved through the first two 8- groups (which are 47 months each); but

 shifts in absolute position are introduced by the 7- groups. We will deal with the shifts in

 detail below. But consideration of the first two turns already suggests a start on a simple
 omission rule: Eclipses in radial columns D4 and column Ai are apparently omitted.
 To see which eclipse possibilities are northerly and which are southerly, we compare

 Fig. 1 with Fig. 2, which is a perspective view of the ecliptic and the Moon's inclined

 orbit, with N and S marking the northern and southern limits of the Moon's orbit. We

 have chosen to begin reckoning with the D eclipse (DO beginning the 8-8-. This turns

 out (as we will show below) to be the most northerly of four successive eclipses at the

 D node. The eclipse possibilities in Fig. 2 occur in the following time order (with the

 omitted eclipses underlined): Dj A,D2A2D3A3D4A4DiA]D2A2D3A3D4A4. Eclipses
 Ai and D4 are omitted because they are the most southerly at each node. (Others might

 possibly be omitted, too, if they are too southerly, but these two types are clear).

 Now, in Fig. 1, we label the radial columns aBcdefGh, where the omitted columns
 are in capital letters. Between an omitted EP at B and an omitted EP at G, four EPs
 will intervene. But, between omitted EPs at G and B, there will be only two. In Fig. 2,

 we see that there are two eclipses between the omitted eclipses D4 and Ai, but four
 eclipses between Aj and D4. By comparison, then, column B of Fig. 1 corresponds
 to Ai in Fig. 2, and column G to D4. Thus, a large amount of ambiguity has been
 removed from the eclipse pattern on the Saros dial of the Antikythera mechanism.
 We know which eclipses go with each node and, for each node, which are the most
 northerly and most southerly eclipses.

 Conclusion of Sect. 7 : It was shown by Freeth et al. that some of the solar eclipses
 that would be predicted by the 8-8-7-8-7- scheme on the AM were omitted. These
 omitted eclipses can be used to establish a classificatory scheme. We denote
 by D1 the northernmost solar eclipse at the descending node in each diagonal
 sequence, fh. Dj (and sometimes D4) label increasingly southerly eclipses in
 the same diagonal sequence. A\ is the most southerly eclipse at the ascending
 node in a diagonal sequence. A2, A3 (and sometimes A4 ) are progressively more
 northerly. Eclipses of types D4 and A\ were omitted. The pattern of omitted
 eclipses allows us to establish which eclipses go with each node and, for each
 node, which are the most northerly and the most southerly eclipses.

 8 Justification of the omission rule for the 47-month cycle

 We shall make the argument first using the 47-month cycle. (Later, we shall see what
 needs to be modified to use the Saros instead). The most important parameter is the
 ratio r = 51/47, since 51 draconic months = 47 synodic months. Let us begin at
 the first eclipse Dj in column 1 of Table 4, and suppose, for the sake of example,
 that the mean conjunction occurs 13.40° clockwise (north) of the node. Then, at D2,
 when 12 synodic months have elapsed, the number of draconic months elapsed will
 be 12 r = 12 x 51/47 = 13 1/47 dm, or 1/47 dm over and above complete draconic

 revolutions with respect to the node. Thus, mean conjunction D2 will occur 360°/47 =

 7.66° beyond (counterclockwise of) Di. That is, D2 will occur at a nodal distance of

 13.40° - 7.66° = 5.74° north of the node. The situation is represented in Fig. 2.

 The D3 conjunction will occur 26 2/47 draconic revolutions after Di and thus

 2 x 360°/47 counterclockwise from Dj. The D4 conjunction will occur 3 x 360°/47

 counterclockwise from Di, as shown in Table 4 and illustrated in Fig. 2. Thus, as

 we move to successive conjunctions at the same node, they occur progressively far

 ther counterclockwise by steps of about 7.66°, corresponding to time differences of

 1/47 dm. But at D5, because there is only an 11-month interval (instead of a 12-month

 interval), the time difference is only 11 x 51/47 dm = (12 - 3/47) dm, corresponding

 to an angular shift of -22.98°, which exactly cancels the accumulated displacements

 of the three preceding steps. Thus, D5 occurs at the same position with respect to the

 node as Di, and the cycle of 47 complete synodic months starts over.

 Consider now the eclipse possibilities at the ascending node. The first eclipse in

 radial column Ai of Fig. 1 occurs six synodic months, and therefore, 6 24/47 = 6.5106

 draconic months, after Di. We may discard the six whole draconic revolutions; and

 the 0.5 merely tells us that we are 180° around the circle, near the other node. Ai

 therefore occurs 0.0106 draconic months, or 3.83°, counterclockwise from the point
 diametrically opposite Di, which puts Ai some 9.57° (=13.40 - 3.83) south of the

 ascending node, as shown in Fig. 2 and as tabulated in Table 5. Successive eclipses

 A2, A3, A4 occur at time intervals of 13 1/47 draconic months. But eclipse A5 occurs
 at an interval of only 11 synodic months (rather than 12) and thus at an interval of
 11 x 51/47 dm = (12 - 3/47) dm, which restores the balance. That is, A5 occurs
 precisely at the same nodal elongation as Aj.

 In the case of the 47-month cycle, because the nodal elongations repeat after each

 group of eight EPs, the simple rule of omitting the eclipses of types D4 and Ai would

 be entirely equivalent to a more complex prescription based on nodal distances. We

 could suppose that eclipse possibilities falling less than, say, 17° north of the node

 are assumed actually to occur, while those falling more than 8° south of the node are
 excluded.

 Conclusion of Sect. 8: In a 47-month cycle, the omission of solar eclipses D4 and

 A\ would be rigorously equivalent to a cutoff of southernmost eclipses based on
 nodal elongation.

 9 Justification of the omission rule for the 8-8-7-8-7- Saros scheme

 We explained the omission rule for solar eclipses on the basis of the 47-month eclipse

 cycle, as this is very simple. Now, we apply the same ideas to the more accurate Saros
 cycle. Here, the crucial parameter is s = 242/223 1.085202), as 242 dm = 223 sm.
 Five successive 47-month cycles would have given us a total of 40 eclipses distrib

 uted over 235 months. The Saros cycle is an improvement that distributes 38 eclipses

 over 223 months. So now we must investigate the distribution of the eclipses between

 the two nodes in the 8-8-7-8-7- Saros scheme. It is convenient to begin reckoning from

 the first solar eclipse in the double-8. We call the month of this eclipse month 1, and

 we assign it to node D.

 The eclipse possibilities must therefore be distributed as in Table 6. Eclipses alter

 nate, of course, between the D and A nodes. The groups of 8 and 7 eclipses are marked

 off by the heavy lines. In each case, the vertical stroke shows where a 5-month inter

 val goes. In the list of D eclipses, we have four successive sequences of 4 eclipses,

 followed by a final sequence of 3 (in the second 7- group). (These sequences of 4 or

 3 eclipses at the same node are what we have called "diagonal sequences"). Thus, the

 total number of eclipses is 19. In the list of A eclipses, the sequence of 3 falls in the

 middle of the 8-8-7-8-7- pattern (in the first 7), so again we have a total of 19. The

 pattern is symmetrical, with each node giving up one eclipse in one of the 7- groups.

 Now, when one D eclipse follows another at an interval of 12 synodic months, the

 elapsed time measured in draconic months is

 AT12 = 12 x 242/223 = 12(1 + 19/223) = 12 + 228/223 = 13 5/223 dm.

 Thus, in Table 7, if the eclipse of month 1 occurs at a certain time -T, measured in

 draconic months with respect to the descending node, then the next eclipse will occur

 at -T-I- 5/223, the next one at -T + 10/223, and the next after that at -T 4-15/223.

 However, at an 11-synodic-month interval (e.g., between months 37 and 48), the

 elapsed time measured in draconic months is

 ATn = 11 x 242/223 = 11(1 + 19/223) = 11 + 209/223 = 12 - 14/223 dm,

 Fig. 3 Mean eclipses near the descending node in a Saros scheme: pattern of elongations from the descend
 ing node. Each sequence of 3 or 4 eclipses at the same node and lying on the same line segment is called a
 "diagonal sequence"

 so the accumulated difference of 15/223 is almost canceled. The fraction of a draconic

 month by which the mean conjunction falls before or after the D node is given in the
 second column. The angular distance, in degrees, of the mean eclipse from the D node

 is then given in column 3. Positive angles are north of the node, and negative angles
 are south of the node.

 In Fig. 3, we display, as an example, numerical values for the mean elongation from

 the descending node for the case T = 18.5/446. (This value of T makes the maximum
 northward and southward elongations from the node approximately equal, for the case

 of the descending node as well as the case of the ascending node). It is easy to see in
 Table 7 (or in Fig. 3) that the Saros scheme guarantees that, of all the solar eclipses
 occurring at the D node, the most northerly will be the Di that begins the double 8-.

 And in this figure, it is finally clear why we call the sequences of 4 or 3 eclipses at the
 same node "diagonal sequences." As can be seen, the prescription to omit all the D4
 eclipses will indeed remove the southernmost ones and only those. It is conceivable
 that the D3 in the final sequence of three eclipses was also omitted; but we do not
 need this result for purposes of dating. It is enough to establish that omission of the

 D4 eclipses is consistent with the evidence of Fig. 1. But the true omission rule might

 actually be to omit the southernmost eclipse of each diagonal sequence.

 Consider now the solar eclipses at the ascending node. The eclipse in synodic
 month 7 occurs 6 synodic months after the eclipse of month 1. Expressed in terms of

 the draconic month the elapsed time amounts to

 AT6 = 6 x 242/223 = 6(1 + 19/223) = 6 + 114/223 = 6 + 228/446

 = 61/2 + 5/446 dm.

 We may ignore the 6 whole draconic months. And l/2 draconic month just takes us
 from the descending to the ascending node. Thus, if the eclipse of month 1 occurs
 at time —T with respect to the D node, eclipse 7 will occur at time —T + 5/446 with

 respect to the A node. Then, successive eclipses at the A node occur at time intervals of

 5/223 dm, as before, with occasional resets by -14/223 dm at the 11-synodic-month
 intervals. See Table 8.

 In Fig. 4, we graph the mean elongation from the ascending node for T = 18.5/446.

 The prescription to omit all the A i eclipses will indeed remove the southernmost ones

 and only those. It is conceivable that the A2 following the sequence of three eclipses

 was also omitted; but we do not need this result for purposes of dating. It is enough to

 establish that omission of the Ai eclipses is consistent with the evidence of Fig. 1).

 Conclusion of Sect. 9: In a 8-8-7-8-7- Saros scheme, the omission of eclipses

 D4 and Ai would cull the nine southernmost solar eclipses in each Saros cycle

 and would be equivalent to a cutoff based on nodal elongation. Alternatively,

 one could omit the southernmost eclipse of each diagonal sequence; this would

 eliminate the ten southernmost and would also be equivalent to a cutoff based on
 nodal distance.

 10 Elimination of solar patterns 1-6

 The rule that solar eclipse possibilities in position D4 were omitted on the Antikythera

 mechanism turns out to be a powerful tool for restricting possibilities. In Table 9, we

 reprint the seven possible solar patterns from Table 2, but have cyclically shifted the
 entries in each column so that each column begins with the D] eclipse at the beginning
 of the double 8-. A horizontal heavy line is used to mark the beginning and end of
 each group of 7 or of 8 eclipses. As before, bold numbers (e.g., 13 and 25) indicate
 a synodic month cell in which there is an extant solar eclipse glyph. The smaller
 numbers in parentheses, such as (37), indicate months for which a solar eclipse would
 be predicted by the 8-8-7-8-7- scheme on display in a particular column of the table.
 If a parenthetical number has a horizontal line through it, such as {7) or (189), this
 indicates that this eclipse possibility must be omitted because of empirical evidence
 on the Antikythera mechanism. In some cases (113, 189, and 190), this is because the
 month cell is preserved and it is clear that no solar eclipse possibility was engraved
 in it; but in other cases (7 and 19), it is because placing a solar EP here would be in
 conflict with the sequence of index letters.9 Thus, the bold numbers and the lined out

 parenthetical numbers are the conditions that have to be satisfied by any scheme of
 omission of solar eclipses.

 Let us consider first the eclipses at the descending node. A descending line \ through

 a bold-faced number indicates a D4 eclipse that actually appears on the mechanism,

 contrary to the rule that such an eclipse should be omitted. Thus, in columns 3, 5, and
 6, EP 137 and 184 are extant D4. These three cases must therefore be eliminated. In
 column 4, EP 131 and 178 are extant D4, so this case is eliminated. In column 1, EP
 178 is an extant D4, so this case also is excluded. Now, in column 2, the descending

 line\through (189) indicates that a D] is missing, contrary to the omission rule that a

 9 Cells 19 and 7 are, at least in theory, extant in fragments F and A, respectively. Cell 7 is almost impossible
 to see. It is also impossible to see Cell 8, or at least to read any letter. But cell 19 is clearer, and it seems
 reasonably clear that there is nothing there. While we cannot be sure from direct examination of these cells,

 the sequence of index letters is enough to decide the issue.

 Di should certainly not be omitted, so this case, too, is excluded. When all the cells

 crossed out by descending lines\(indicating a violation of the omission rules at the

 descending node) are considered, it will be seen that Case 7 is the only survivor. But in

 Sect. 6, we showed that solar pattern 7 is only compatible with lunar pattern ß. Thus,

 we are left with Iß as the only solution.

 Some supporting evidence is also available from study of the eclipses at the ascend

 ing node. Violations of the omission rules at the ascending node are indicated by an

 ascending line /. It turns out that not enough of these eclipse inscriptions are preserved

 to provide as much discriminating power as do the eclipses at the descending node.

 However, cases 3, 5, and 6 are again ruled out—they each have an extant EP at an
 Ai (which should be omitted) in month 13. Case 6 is also excluded because the cell

 for month 190 clearly has no solar eclipse glyph, but is an A4 that, according to the
 omission rules, should not be omitted.

 All cells that involve violation of the omission rules (at either of the two nodes) are

 shaded gray. It is possible that arguments could be made for a few other cells. Here,

 we have restricted ourselves to Di, D4, Ai, and A4 eclipses, for which the rules are
 the clearest.

 Conclusion of Sect. 10: When the omission rules are applied, only solution 7ß

 (from Sect. 5) survives as a possibility.

 11 Empirical test of the omission rules

 Given that an astronomer as cogent as Ptolemy adopted an omission rule for solar

 eclipses occurring too far south of the node, we might consider the possibility there is

 something reasonable in this strategy. Therefore, we used the Javascript Solar Eclipse

 Explorer, on the NASA Eclipse Web Site, to determine all the solar eclipses that were

 visible from Babylon between the years -400 and 0 (Espenak, Solar Eclipse Explorer).
 There were 149 of them.

 For each of these eclipses, we calculated the Moon's distance from the node at

 the moment of greatest eclipse. The most southern visible eclipse at the D node was

 6.02° south of the node. The most southern visible eclipse at the A node was 0.2°

 south of the node. Now, in Fig. 4, the northernmost Ai eclipse is around 7.7° south of

 the node; and in Fig. 3, the northernmost D4eclipse is around 9.3° south of the node.

 Thus, it is clear that the southernmost eclipses actually visible at Babylon could not

 possibly be a D4 or Aj. (The numerical boundaries of D4 and Aj in Figs. 3 and 4 can be

 modified a bit, by taking slightly different values for the parameter T in Tables 7 and

 8; but the changes cannot be large, or the graphs will become grossly asymmetrical).

 There simply were no D^or A \ solar eclipses visible from Babylon for 400years. The

 omission rule would have performed very well.

 An alternative way of seeing this is by directly categorizing eclipses in the Espe

 nak catalog. The criterion for assigning the eclipses is as follows. Consider the D

 eclipses separately; usually, they are 12 months apart, but sometimes only 11. If, at

 the descending node, an eclipse follows an 11-month interval (at that node), it is a Di,

 the next is a D2, and so on. Similarly consider the A eclipses in isolation. If, at the
 ascending node, an eclipse comes after an 11-month interval (at that node), it is an
 Ai, the next is an A2, and so on. Then, it is an easy matter to count up the eclipses

 of each type. The results are displayed in Fig. 5, where the number that occurred is
 shown in parentheses for each type of eclipse. Again we see that there were no D4 or
 Ai eclipses were visible at Babylon. Although omission schemes of this sort have not

 yet been found in the Babylonian material, it is tempting to imagine that Ptolemy's
 omission scheme based on nodal distances is a rationalization of an earlier scheme

 based simply on the omission of the southernmost eclipse of each diagonal sequence,

 or something closely related to that.

 Conclusion of Sect. 11: Omission of the D4 and A1 eclipses would have been an
 excellent empirical rule. Not a single £>4 or A] was visible from Babylon between
 years —400 and 0.

 12 Candidates for epoch

 Table 10 displays the solar eclipses that are the candidates for the solar eclipse in Saros

 cell 13 of the Antikythera mechanism. Cell 13 carries, of course, the Di eclipse that
 begins the solar 8-8- on the extant Saros dial. Dates shown in bold type come from
 Steele's reconstruction of the Babylonian eclipse records: These are the dates of the
 first solar EP in a double 8- group. (These are, of course, all eclipses of type Di). The

 heavy vertical bars mark the approximate location of Babylonian recalibrations of the

 Saros scheme. The extreme left-hand column gives the Saros series number of each of

 these eclipses. The shaded gray cells show solar eclipses of type Di from the Espenak
 catalog (computed from modern theory) that could function well as the first eclipse of
 an 8-8-7-8-7- scheme.

 Let us study how the Babylonian recalibrations occur. Take, for example, the suc
 cessive Saros cycles beginning with —203 May 17, —185 May 28, and —167 June 7.
 Again, these are all dates of first solar eclipses in a double 8-. Since the Babylonian
 dates fall in the shaded cells, we can see that the Babylonian record is in good agree

 ment with the phenomena for this stretch. But by year -149, solar Saros series 44 had

 ended—this was no longer an actually occurring eclipse. The Babylonians, however,
 continued to run their 8-8-7-8-7- scheme without modification for two more Saros

 cycles. Then, there was a change of calibration—with the eclipse of —109 April 28

 now serving as the first eclipse of a double 8- (as opposed to the "eclipse" of -113

 July 19, which has been abandoned).

 The recalibration occurs in the following way (see Fig. 6). In the old calibration, the

 last two eclipse groups of an 8-8-7-8-7- cycle are marked in italic: 8, 7. The next 8-8

 7-8-7-, shown in bold, is scheduled to begin. However, instead, a single 8- is inserted

 on its own as a single 47-month bridge (shown underlined, 8). Because the 8-eclipse,

 47-month cycle is a good approximation to the full 223-month Saros, this does not

 disrupt the alternation of eclipses between the two nodes, nor affect the Di A1D2A2...

 sequence. After the bridging group (8) has been completed, the new calibration begins

 with the first eclipse of an 8-8-7-8-7-. The effect of the recalibration is to delay the

 start of the next 8-8-7-8-7- by 47 months. At least after -250, a recalibration may

 often be recognized in Steele's table by a run of three 8- groups in a row. With the

 particular Babylonian recalibration under discussion, -109 April 28 is the first eclipse

 of a double 8-, and the new calibration is again in good agreement with the eclipse

 phenomena. In a number of cases, the insertion of a delaying 47-month cycle is quite

 clear in Steele's tables.10 In other cases, the situation is a bit murky in the course of the

 recalibration; but once it is over, it is easy to see that the date of the newly functioning

 8-8- has indeed been delayed by 47 months.

 It should be noted how powerful are the simplifying effects of the omission of the

 southernmost solar eclipses and the Babylonian connection. Because of the former, we

 can identify the ascending and descending nodes and can unambiguously characterize
 the eclipse in month 13 on the mechanism's Saros dial as a northernmost eclipse
 occurring at the descending node. Because of the later, we then have a restricted

 family of candidates for the eclipse of month 13. These are shown in bold in Table 10,

 though one should probably also keep under consideration eclipses that occurred in

 the same Saros series shortly after a recalibration (non-bold eclipses just to the right of

 the end of a line of bold eclipses). For example, suppose the Babylonians were running

 Saros series 42 for their Di eclipse beginning the 8-8-, A recalibration occurred, and

 they went over to Saros series 44. But it is conceivable that a Greek astronomer did not

 have up-to-date information and used the eclipse of -207 Jul 29 (instead of moving
 over to the eclipse of -203 May 17) as his Dj beginning the 8-8-.

 10

 For example, the solar recalibrations that took place in -387 and in -265.

 Conclusion of Sect. 12: We assume, for purposes of investigation, that the D\ solar

 eclipse at the start of the 8-8- on the Saros dial of the Antikythera mechanism is

 one of those shown in bold in Table 10. These are eclipses that served the same

 function in the Babylonian record. Or, if the maker of the AM were using a slightly

 out-of-date Babylonian Saros table, the solar eclipse month 13 could be one of

 the eclipses in italic, located just to the right of a sequence of bold eclipses.

 13 Lunar and solar equations of center

 On the Antikythera mechanism, eclipses of the same kind (solar or lunar) come at 5- or

 6-month intervals. The mean synodic month Ts is about 29.53085 days11, so a 5-month

 interval represents 147.654 days, or about 15.7 h over and above whole days. A 6-month

 interval represents 4.4 h over and above whole days. Thus, the local time of day of an

 eclipse should advance by either 15.7h or by 4.4h over its predecessor, owing to the

 mean motions alone. Departures of the recorded eclipse times from this simple pattern

 can be taken as signs that the solar and/or the lunar equation of center might be built

 into the predictive pattern. Solar and lunar equations could be embedded in the eclipse

 times in two different ways. If the eclipse times are the results of theoretical calculation,

 they should reflect whatever theory the ancient astronomer used to model the lunar

 anomaly, or solar anomaly, or both. The equation of center of the Moon could have been

 modeled by an epicycle or a linear zigzag function, for example. Or, if the eclipse times

 are based largely on observations (with some sort of interpolation for unobservable

 eclipses), they should reflect the actual equations of center of the Sun and Moon.

 The longitude of the Sun XG and of the Moon Xz may be written

 ^•o = + <?o

 l-d. — A,(j + q<i,

 q = e sinä,

 â = X - n,

 where the overbar denotes mean quantities, which increase uniformly with time, q

 is the equation of center, and for either the Sun or the Moon, it may be modeled

 approximately by

 where â is the mean anomaly, defined as the excess of the mean longitude over longi
 tude of the perigee. That is, _ ___

 where n is the longitude of the perigee. For the Sun, e is around 2°; and, for the Moon,
 around 5°.12

 11 We take the year to be 3651/4 days and assume the Metonic relation 235 synodic months = 19 years.

 12 The maximum value of the Moon's equation of center is actually about 6.3°; but we are concerned with

 eclipses, i.e., with phenomena taking place at new and full Moon. In these situations, the equation of center

 is reduced by the evection by about 1.3°; thus, the effective maximum equation of center at new and full

 Moons is about 5°. We neglect higher order terms in the equation of center, the annual equation, and other

 small perturbations of the Moon's longitude.

 Now, at the middle of a solar eclipse—at a true conjunction—we must have

 and thus

 Xq =

 X(j = Xq + qQ - (at mid-eclipse).

 Consider first the effect of qQ acting alone (by setting q^ temporarily equal to zero).

 A positive qQ tends to make Ä.2 greater than Xq at the time of true conjunction: The

 true conjunction therefore occurs after (later than) the mean conjunction. Consider

 now the effect of q^ alone. A positive q^ tends to make Ä.3 less than Xq at the time of

 true conjunction: The true conjunction therefore occurs before (earlier than) the mean

 conjunction.

 The mean motion of the Moon with respect to the Sun is roughly 12.2°/day. Thus,

 the effect of the solar anomaly is to make the true conjunction come later than the mean

 conjunction by about (2°)/(12.2°/day) = 3.9 h when the solar equation is positive and

 at its peak value. (Here, for simplicity, we take the relative velocity of the Moon and

 Sun to be constant. In Sect. 19, we shall see how to take its variability into account).

 The effect of the lunar anomaly is to make the true conjunction come earlier than the

 mean by about (5°)/(12.2°/day) = 9.8 h when the lunar equation is positive and at

 its peak value. Alexander Jones made a study of the eclipse times in the glyphs of

 the Saros dial, successfully detected the lunar anomaly, and found that the Moon was

 very nearly at apogee at the full Moon of Saros cell 1. According to Jones, the solar

 anomaly did not show up (Jones, personal communication).

 To make our own study, we proceed as follows. We will reckon time from the oppo

 sition (full Moon) of month 1 on the Saros dial. We assume that the mean opposition

 of month 1 occurs at a local hour ho (a time of day), whose value is not yet known.13

 Suppose that in some later month, there is a lunar or solar eclipse that, according to

 the mechanism, occurs A M synodic months after the opposition of month 1. For lunar

 eclipses, A M will be an integer. For solar eclipses, AM will be an integer plus one

 half. Now, if the Moon and Sun both moved uniformly, the expected mean time of day

 (EMT) at which the second eclipse occurs would be given by

 EMT = ho + 24frac(rsAM),

 where Ts is the length of the synodic month in days and ffac() denotes the fractional

 part of the argument (i.e., with the integral part discarded). For example, since Ts

 is about 29.53085d, two eclipses that take place 12 synodic months apart should be

 separated, on the average, by 29.53085d x 12 = 354.3202d. The fractional part of this

 is 0.3202d = 8.885h. Thus, the second eclipse would take place 8.9h later in the day,

 if there were no effects of the solar or lunar anomaly.

 13 By the instant of opposition, we mean instant when the Moon's mean longitude is equal to the Sun's

 mean longitude +180°. ho is the_local time of day at which this happened. The time of true opposition
 would be ho, which differs from ho due to the contributions of the lunar and solar equations.

 Let GT (for glyph time) be the local time of the eclipse indicated by the eclipse

 glyph. (We will discuss below how we turn the glyph times into 24-h time). Then,

 the advance or delay in time (ADT) of the recorded glyph, in comparison with what

 would be expected if only mean motions were involved, is

 ADT = GT - EMT.

 The ADT for each eclipse thus depends on the glyph time GT for that eclipse, and

 the number AM of mean synodic months elapsed since the full Moon of month 1.

 However, ADT also contains the unknown parameter ho (the local time of day of the

 mean opposition of month 1).

 Now, as explained above, if the ADT values of the eclipses are due to the lunar

 and/or the solar equation of center, they can be modeled by sinusoidal fitting functions.

 Consider the lunar anomaly. The argument of the sine function is the mean anomaly of

 the Moon—how far the mean Moon is past the perigee. Thus, the argument, expressed
 in radian measure, is

 ä= 27t(At/TA + <Pa),

 where Ta is the anomalistic month (the average time between successive perigee

 crossings) and At is the time elapsed between the initial moment and the moment in

 question. Thus, At/ T\ is the time elapsed expressed as a fraction of the anomalistic

 month, while 2rcAt/TA is the increase in the mean anomaly (in radians) beyond

 its starting value. 2n<p^ is the value of the mean anomaly at the initial moment.

 (ipd itself is expressed as a fraction of an anomalistic month and must be between
 0 and 1).

 The case goes similarly for the Sun, except that the period involved is the tropical

 year of length Y. Thus, the ADT values can be fitted by a function of the form

 F = —Ad sin2n(At/TA + <pq. ) + A© sin2jr(Ar/T + <pq),

 where Aj and A© are positive and are expressed in hours. (Note their opposite signs,

 explained above). At is the time in days elapsed since the opposition of month 1, Ta

 is the length of the anomalistic month, and Y is the tropical year, is the initial value

 of the lunar mean anomaly, expressed as a fraction of an anomalistic month, and y?©

 is the initial solar mean anomaly, reckoned from the solar perigee, at the opposition

 of month 1, expressed as a fraction of a year. Note that At — AM Ts - Thus, we may
 put At/Ta = AM Ts/Ta- Similarly, At/Y = AM Ts/Y.

 We form the quantity Q by computing (ADT - F)2 for each eclipse and summing

 over all the extant eclipses:

 Q = Ej [GT\ - ho - 24 frac(Ts AM;) + Aj sin2jr(AMiTs/TA + (Pa )

 -AQsm27t(AMiTs/Y + <PQ)]2.

 For each extant eclipse i, the input data taken from the mechanism are GT, (local time

 of the eclipse) and AM; (number of mean synodic months elapsed since the opposition

 and ho- The parameters A<j, A©, <p^ , and <p© characterize the lunar and solar equations

 of center that best account for the pattern of eclipse times on the Saros dial. Note that Q

 contains an adjustable time ho, which can be interpreted as the local time of the instant

 of mean opposition in month 1. From a data fitting point of view, ho is responsible for

 adjusting the mean value of ADT to approximately zero, so that the data may be fitted

 by the two sine functions.

 We must say a word about the form in which the eclipse times are inscribed on the

 mechanism. First, there is a notice of whether the eclipse is of the Sun or Moon. Then,

 the hour is given. For an eclipse of the Sun, if the eclipse takes place in the daytime,

 the hour is simply noted as a number; but if the eclipse takes place at night, the hour is

 given along with a notation for "night." For an eclipse of the Moon, the convention is

 just the opposite: If the eclipse takes place in the night, the hour is noted, but no other

 notice is given; but if the eclipse takes place in the day, the hour is noted along with a

 notation for "day."

 There is some question of whether the eclipse times are meant to be in seasonal or

 equinoctial hours. The fact that, for the 22 preserved eclipses, there is no case of an

 hour exceeding 12 seems to imply seasonal hours. On the other hand, the exeligmos

 dial provides for 0, 8, or 16 h to be added to the recorded eclipse times as we move

 through three Saros cycles, and these can only make sense as equinoctial hours. We

 shall treat the hours in the eclipse glyphs as if they were all evaluated on the equinox.

 Thus, we treat the day as beginning at 6 a.m. and ending at 6 p.m. So a notice for the

 first hour of the day is translated to 7h in a 24 h clock system with the Oh at midnight,
 and so on:

 1st hour of day

 6th hour of day

 12th hour of day

 1st hour of night

 6th hour of night

 24or0

 7th hour of night  1

 12th hour of night

 7h

 We do not know if this is really the correct way to treat the times. However, for

 days within a month of the equinox, and for times within a couple of hours of noon

 or midnight, the error of interpretation will be negligible. For other times of year and

 of the day, the error of interpretation could potentially rise to 11/4 h or so (supposing,
 for instance, that the mechanism was built for the clime of 14i/2h). In the search

 for the presence of a lunar or a solar equation (with amplitudes of about 10 and

 4h, respectively), the possibility of such small errors should not prevent us from

 proceeding.

 Finally, we must point out that for some of the eclipses it is necessary to correct

 the glyph time by ±24 h. Here is the reason. Let us begin from the lunar eclipse of

 month 20, which is marked on the mechanism as occurring at sixth hour of the night

 (=midnight, or 011 in the 24-h clock system). Now, take some other eclipse, such as
 the lunar eclipse of month 137, which, according to the mechanism, takes place at

 the fifth hour of the day (=1 lh in the 24-h system). Since the second eclipse takes

 place 117 synodic months later than the first one, from the mean motions alone the

 second eclipse should occur 117 x 29.53085d = 3455d2.62h later than the first one.

 Thus, since the first eclipse occurred at 0h, we would expect the second eclipse to
 occur at 2.62h on the basis of the mean motions alone. However, the advance in time

 between the two eclipses as engraved on the mechanism is 1 lh. Thus, the eclipse time

 has apparently advanced by 11 - 2.62 = 8.38 h more than we would expect on the

 basis of the mean motions. These 8.38 h are presumably due to the change in the solar

 and/or lunar equation. However, we do not really know that the time of eclipse has

 advanced by 8.38 h. If the second eclipse occurred 3,454d llh after the first one, or

 3,455d llh after the first one, or 3,456d 1 lh, the ancient mechanic would have in any

 case inscribed the time as the fifth hour of the day. But in the first case, the advance

 in time from the first eclipse, over and above the effect of the mean motions, would
 be 8.38 - 24 = -15.62h; in the second case, the advance would be 8.38h; and in the

 third case, it would be 8.38 + 24 = 32.38h. That is, we cannot tell a priori whether

 the effect of the lunar and solar equations has been to advance the second eclipse by

 8.38h with respect to the mean motions, to advance it by 32.38, or to retard it by

 15.62. Now, the maximum lunar equation of 10h and the maximum solar equation of

 4 h together amount to a maximum of 14h. If the first eclipse occurred early by, say,

 14 h and the second occurred 14 h late, the effect of the lunar and solar equations could

 shift the expected time of the second eclipse by up to 28 h, over and above the effect

 of the mean motions. Thus, the possibility of an advance by 32.38h may probably be

 ruled out. However, we cannot tell whether the eclipse time advanced by 8.32h or was

 retarded by 15.62h, over and above the effect of the mean motions.

 Considerable headway can be made in determining which eclipses require a 24

 h correction by comparing pairs or larger sets of eclipses for which the lunar mean
 anomaly is nearly the same. These would be eclipses separated by nearly a whole

 number of anomalistic months. Then, the effect of a change in the lunar equation is

 largely removed. Thus, the maximum possible time shift, over and above the effect of

 the mean motions, would be about 8 h—the maximum possible shift due to the solar

 anomaly acting alone. See "Appendix 4" for examples this sort of analysis.

 Table 11 contains the fundamental data used for the analysis of the solar and lunar

 anomalies. The first column shows the events—eclipses of the Sun (S) and Moon (M)

 engraved in particular month cells of the Saros dial. We choose to reckon time from

 the opposition of month 1 (which was not an eclipse). The second column gives the

 times of day for the eclipses, as engraved on the AM—for example, for eclipse 13S,

 the first hour of the day. (No time of day is inscribed for the opposition of month 1). In

 the next few columns, we put these data into forms that are suitable for the analysis.

 Column 3 gives the number of synodic months elapsed from the opposition of month

 1. Each lunar eclipse occurs a whole number of synodic months from this opposition.

 Each solar eclipse occurs a half-integral number of synodic months from our starting

 point. The fourth column gives the times of day of the eclipses, converted to modern

 24-h time using the method described above. As explained above, for the purposes of

 investigation of the anomalies, it is necessary to correct some of the clock times by 24

 h. The required corrections are given in column 5, and the method for making them

 is explained in "Appendix 4." The adjusted times are shown in the 6th column (which

 is the sum of columns 4 and 5). The data in columns 3 and 6 are the subject of the

 investigation. Note that ho, the time of day of the opposition of month 1, is an unknown

 parameter that must be obtained in the course of the investigation. Column 3 provides

 the AM, appearing in the expression for Q above. Column 6 provides the GT;.

 The results of the parameter fitting are shown in Table 12. Using all 22 eclipses

 (both lunar and solar), we find the presence of both a lunar and a solar equation, with

 amplitudes in the expected ranges. Table 12 also demonstrates a reassuring stability of

 the parameters. Thus, if we use all 22 eclipses, or if we exclude either 2 or 4 outliers,

 or if we use only the 12 lunar eclipses, or weight the solar eclipses by 50 % (because,

 as we shall see, the timing errors for the solar eclipses are larger than for the lunar), the

 results do not change drastically. The amplitude of the lunar equation varies between

 9.0 and 9.8 h, in the expected range. The amplitude of the solar anomaly varies between

 3.0 and 3.4—close to what we would expect, ho varies between -7.96 and -9.41 h.

 (These values of ho are equivalent to 16:02 and 14:35—our range for the expected

 time of day of the opposition of month 1. As we shall see in Sect. 22.2, this is a useful

 result for dating).

 The lunar mean anomaly (reckoned from perigee) at the opposition of month 1

 comes out between 184.7° and 206.0°. These are all reasonably near the apogee of

 the Moon's orbit. That is, it seems that at the opposition of month 1, the Moon was

 near apogee. Here, we confirm a result of Alexander Jones. Jones conjectured that

 this might explain why the Saros dial beings with an empty, eclipseless month—the

 starting point was a date on which the Moon was at apogee. We certainly do not

 imagine that we can determine the Moon's anomaly to better than ±2 days' worth of
 motion, i.e., about 26°, so our results are compatible with Jones' conjecture. While

 Jones found no evidence of a solar equation, we do find a robust solar signal. The solar

 anomaly (reckoned from perigee) comes out between 149.5° and 180.4° (depending
 on the subset of eclipses used). Notably, these are near the solar apogee. Thus, it

 seems possible that the ancient mechanic was using an arithmetical template for the
 anomalies, which started with both solar and lunar anomalies equal to zero (measured,

 in ancient fashion, from apogee).

 Graphs of the fits are shown in Figs. 7,8,9, and 10. Figures 7 and 8 give the fits with

 four outlier points excluded. Figures 9 and 10 show the best fits with all 22 eclipses

 used. In "Appendix 5," we discuss the identification of outliers. For here it suffices to

 note that the residuals for 13S and 125M are so great that matters would be improved

 if these two eclipses were changed day for night (a 12-h shift), a point already noted

 by Jones. We suspect a copying error in the engraving. Also, the hour inscribed for

 120M has an underdot in Jones's text, indicating that the reading is not certain.

 Conclusion of Sect. 13: The eclipse times inscribed on the Saros dial of the AM

 reveal the clear presence of a lunar equation of center and probably also of a

 solar equation of center. The lunar mean anomaly ( reckoned from perigee) at the

 position of month 1 was near 191°. The solar mean anomaly at the opposition of
 month 1 was between 150° and 180°.

 14 Statistical test of the explanatory power of the solar fit

 The fact that the lunar equation of center is present in the eclipse times inscribed on
 the AM seems indisputable. For the solar equation, the evidence is less clear-cut, so
 it is important to perform a statistical test to see how much faith should be placed in

 this result. Does the theoretical model with lunar equation plus solar equation provide
 a quantifiable explanatory advantage over a theoretical model with lunar equation
 only?

 In this case, we have two models, a full model and a reduced model, with the

 reduced model nested within the full one. In the full model, there are five parameters—

 parameters may be removed from the model. We shall use an F-test (named after
 the British statistician Ronald Fisher, who introduced a version of it in the 1920s)
 to assess whether the solar parameters contribute meaningfully. The null hypoth
 esis for this type of F-test is that the full model offers no additional explanatory
 power over the reduced model. In other words, the null hypothesis is that the "true"
 underlying relationship between the recorded times of day for the eclipses and the
 explanatory parameters (amplitude and phase of the lunar equation of center, etc.)
 is that given by the reduced model; the full model with its additional parameters is
 unwittingly modeling as a systematic relationship some of what is actually random
 fluctuation.

 The F-statistic is

 (SSRr-SSRf)/(*f-*ä)

 F

 SSRF/(n - kp)

 where SSRr is the sum of the squared residuals in the reduced model and SSRf is

 the sum of the squared residuals in the full model, kp is the number of parameters

 in the full model (in this case, 5) and kp is the number of parameters in the reduced

 model (in this case, 3). n is the number of data points whose values we are trying

 to explain. The numerator of F is the reduction in the total squared error as we pass

 over from the reduced to the full model, divided by the number of extra parame

 ters used. Thus, the numerator is a measure of the increase in explanatory power per

 extra parameter used. The denominator is the total squared error remaining in the full

 model per degree of freedom. If the null hypothesis were true (and the full model

 were therefore no real improvement on the reduced model), we would expect F to

 be near 1. If the new parameters of the full model do a good job of reducing the

 residuals, then F will be larger than 1. The larger the departure of F from unity,

 the more the null hypothesis is called into doubt. Tables or packaged programs can
 be used to determine a p-value as a function of the three values F, kp - kp, and

 n - kp. A p value of 0.05, for example, means that if the reduced model really were
 adequate, the full model would still have a probability of 0.05, simply by chance,
 of reducing the SSE by at least as much as it has.14 Thus, a small p value pro
 vides evidence that the full model makes a significant improvement in the reduced
 model.

 The results of the computations are shown in Table 13. As we can see, with the four

 outliers discarded, the p value is 0.0068. Even with the outliers included (using all 22

 eclipses), the p value is only 0.03. It therefore appears likely that the inclusion of the

 solar equation of center provides a meaningful reduction in the residuals. However, we

 have no need of the solar equation to establish an epoch and shall not make deductions

 from the solar equation a central part of our argument. However, as we shall see in

 Sect. 22.1, this can be used after the epoch is established to provide some additional

 confirming evidence.

 14 For an introduction to the F-test, see (Ramsey and Schäfer 2002, pp. 122-127,280-285), with tables at
 pp. 720-727. A more mathematically detailed explanation is given in Fox (2008, pp. 200-202). Functions

 for calculating the p value from the F-statistic are provided in Excel and other commonly available programs.

 Conclusion of Sect. 14: The solar equation of center embedded in the eclipse

 times on the Saros dial of the AM is probably meaningful. The probability that

 mere chance could reduce the residuals by as much as or more than does the solar

 fit is only around 3 %, or < 1 %, depending on whether all eclipses are used or
 some outliers are excluded.

 15 Determination of the Saros series number of the solar eclipse of month 13

 We have shown that the Saros dial of the AM entails that the lunar mean anomaly was

 around 191° (reckoned from perigee) at the opposition of month 1. Because we do

 not imagine that we can determine the anomaly to a better precision than about two

 days' worth of motion, we shall take it to be 191° ± 26°. When used in conjunction

 with the Babylonian recalibrations, this provides a dating tool of considerable power.

 This is because of the discontinuous jump in the lunar mean anomaly produced by

 a Babylonian recalibration. A Saros cycle contains approximately a whole number

 of synodic months, draconic months, and anomalistic months. Thus, two eclipses
 in the same Saros series will have similar values of the lunar mean anomaly. But

 during a recalibration, a 47-month period is slipped in. The 47-month period contains

 approximately a whole number of synodic months and draconic months, but does not
 contain a whole number of anomalistic months. This is the source of the discontinuity

 of the lunar mean anomaly over a recalibration.

 Our candidates for the solar eclipse of month 13 (which begins the 8- 8- and therefore

 must be a Dj) are shown in bold in Table 10. Thus, we expect that the solar eclipse

 of month 13 belongs to one of the solar Saros series 40, 42, 44, 46, or 48. The bold

 faced eclipses are those that occur in the Babylonian record as starting a double 8-,

 Of course, it is also possible that a Greek mechanic did not get the word about the

 latest Babylonian recalibration and continued to use eclipses predicted for a running

 Saros series, even after the Babylonians had abandoned it. Thus, in Table 10, we could

 consider a few eclipses that continue a horizontal line immediately after the end of the

 bold type and the heavy vertical bar marking a recalibration.

 We compute from modern theory the value of the lunar mean anomaly at the middle

 of each solar eclipse belonging to these Saros series, for eclipses from the middle of

 the fourth to the middle of the first century BCE.15 We assume, for each in turn, that

 one of these eclipses is the eclipse of month 13. Then, it is an easy matter to roll the

 calculated lunar mean anomaly back by 121/2 synodic months, to determine the value

 that the mean anomaly would have had at the opposition of month 1, if the eclipse

 being examined really were the solar eclipse of month 13.

 15 For the middle of the eclipse, here, more precisely, is what we used: For eclipses that actually occurred,

 we used the time of greatest eclipse from the Espenak solar eclipse catalog. For eclipses predicted by the

 Babylonians which did not really occur, we use the time of true conjunction, from (Espenak, Six Millennium

 Catalog of Phases of the Moon).

 Fig. 11 Demonstration that the solar eclipse of month 13 belongs to lunar Saros series 44. Plotted on the
 vertical axis is the lunar mean anomaly that must obtain at the (true) opposition of month 1, for various
 choices of the identity of solar eclipse 13. For example, for Saros series 40, the six x's correspond to the six
 bold-faced eclipses for Saros series 40 in Table 10. In the Babylonian record, each of these eclipses served
 as the Dj eclipse beginning a 8-8-. The gray boxes correspond to eclipses that could have worked well
 (according to modern data in the Espenak catalog) as the Di eclipse beginning a 8-8-. Now, the lunar mean
 anomaly is known to have been in the vicinity of 180° for the opposition of month 1. The solar eclipse of
 month 13 must therefore have belonged to solar Saros series 44

 In Fig. 11, we see a graph showing the values that the lunar mean anomaly must
 have at the opposition of month 1, under the assumption that the solar eclipse of
 month 13 corresponds to any of the eclipses in a given Saros series. For example, we
 compute the value of the lunar mean anomaly at the opposition of month 1, under
 the assumption that the solar eclipse of month 13 belongs to solar Saros series 46
 (including eclipses on —217 Feb 22, —199 Mar 4, ..., —109 Apr 28, and —91 May
 8). As can be seen, the possible values of the mean anomaly for the opposition of
 month 1 form a slowly decreasing sequence. Each x indicates an eclipse used as a
 D] beginning the double 8- in the Babylonian record. Each gray square indicates an
 eclipse that would function well as such a Di according to the Espenak catalog. As
 can be seen, assuming that the eclipse of month 13 belongs to solar Saros series 44, or

 42, or 46 results in quite different sequences of possible values for the mean anomaly

 at the opposition of month 1. Since the value of the lunar mean anomaly is known to
 be near 180° for the opposition of month 1, it is clear that the solar eclipse of month
 13 must belong to solar Saros series 44. The large jump in the mean anomaly from
 one Saros series to the next at the time of the recalibration (a discontinuity of 134°)
 makes only one solution possible. So, now we are left with a much smaller number of

 eclipses that are candidates for the solar eclipse of month 13, and they all belong to
 solar Saros series 44 or its continuation.

 Those in bold served as the

 leadoff eclipses of an 8-8- in the

 Babylonian record

 Conclusion of Sect. 15: The solar eclipse of month 13 on the Saros dial of the

 Antikythera mechanism belongs to solar Saros series 44.

 16 Absolute time of eclipses

 In Table 14, we display the dates the eclipses of Saros 44 that are candidates for
 the solar eclipse of month 13, together with the resulting dates for the opposition

 of month 1. (Those shown in bold were actually used by the Babylonians to begin

 a double 8- group). For all the eclipses in group 1, the time of day of the eclipse

 should be roughly the same. The eclipses in group 2 should come roughly 8 h later

 in the day and in group 3 should come about 16 h later in the day. We refer to this as

 the "rule of 8 h," which is a well-known predictive tool from Babylonian and Greek

 astronomy. When the extant eclipse times engraved on the Saros dial are compared

 with the actual times of these candidate eclipses, it is possible to rule out two groups
 of the three.

 The actual times of greatest eclipse are given by Espenak, in terms of dynami
 cal time (TD). (Espenak, Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses) and (Espenak,

 Five Millennium Catalog of Solar Eclipses). We convert to theoretical values of local

 "Antikythera Mechanism Time" (AT) for each eclipse by applying AT (due to the
 deceleration of the Earth's rotation) and a correction for change of meridian from
 Greenwich to the middle of the Greek cultural zone:

 AT = DT - AT + 1 35"

 The values of AT at the moment of each eclipse are also given by Espenak. The
 empirical values for AT of course come from the inscriptions on the Saros dial.

 In Fig. 12, we plot the eclipse times from the Antikythera mechanism and the actual

 eclipse times for the Saros cycle beginning with the eclipse of —239 April 25, which

 we take as a representative of group 1. The two patterns are badly out of phase. Group

 1 is therefore rejected.

 In Fig. 13, we plot the eclipse times from the mechanism and the times for the Saros
 cycle beginning with the eclipse of —221 May 6, a representative of group 2. Group
 2 is also rejected.

 In Fig. 14, we plot the eclipse times from the Antikythera mechanism and the
 actual eclipse times for the Saros cycle beginning with the eclipse of —203 May 17,
 a representative of group 3. The fit is quite good in terms of phase, and so group 3 is
 confirmed. In Fig. 15, we repeat the graph of Fig. 14, but with the four outliers (13S,
 120M, 125M, and 184M) excluded.

 Conclusion of Sect. 16: The eclipses of groups 1 and 2 in Table 14 are ruled
 out as candidates for the solar eclipse of month 13; group 3 is thus confirmed.
 The surviving candidates are therefore the eclipses in solar Saros 44 that lie
 in columns G, J, M, and P of Table 10. (These are the group three eclipses in
 Table 14).

 17 Breakdown of the rule of 8 h

 We have already alluded to the "rule of 8h." If the time of eclipse is given for each

 eclipse in a Saros cycle (let us call it cycle 0), the approximate time for the correspond
 ing eclipse in the next Saros cycle (cycle 1) can be obtained by adding 8h. Adding 8
 more hours gives the approximate eclipse time in cycle 2. And then in cycle 3 (since
 one complete exeligmos consisting of 3 Saros cycles has elapsed), the eclipse time
 returns approximately to its value in cycle 0.

 However, the rule of 8 h is only approximately valid and it breaks down after a
 relatively small number of Saros cycles. In Fig. 16, we illustrate this breakdown using
 as example lunar Saros series 54. The lunar eclipses in the series come at successive
 intervals of 223 synodic months. We start from eclipse 0, the eclipse of —946 May 25,
 which fell at 23:02 UT according to the Espenak catalog.16 (The last eclipse of this
 Saros series is for is 334 July 3). Plotted on the vertical axis is: the time of the eclipse

 predicted by the rule of 8 h minus the actual time of the eclipse. Thus for eclipse 1,
 we add 8 h to the time of eclipse 0 to obtain the "expected time" of eclipse 1 and then
 subtract the actual time of eclipse 1. For eclipse 2, we add 16 h to the time of eclipse
 0 and subtract the actual time. For eclipse 3, we again expect the same time as for
 eclipse 0, from which we subtract the actual time of eclipse 3, and so on. As can be
 seen, the prediction for eclipse 1 is not bad—it comes only 1 'Ah from the expected

 Espenak actually gives the time of greatest eclipse in terms of TD. We have converted to UT.

 Fig. 16 Breakdown of the rule of 8 h illustrated for lunar Saros series 54. Successive data points are
 separated by 223 synodic months (one Saros cycle)

 time. But when we have advanced by one whole exeligmos (eclipse 3), the expected

 time is more than 4 h off. After two exeligmos cycles, we are off by some 7 h. And the
 error produced by the rule of 8h can be larger than 8h! Moreover, each Saros series

 shows a different error pattern. Thus, if the eclipse predictor of the AM were designed
 to fit a particular Saros cycle reasonably well, it would fit other Saros cycles much
 less well. This provides a dating tool of considerable power.

 In Table 14, each eclipse of group 3 is still a candidate. Each candidate is separated

 from its group 3 neighbors by an exeligmos cycle. Can we find a way to select one
 single eclipse of group 3 and exclude the others? We can, by exploiting the breakdown
 of the rule of 8 h.

 For each eclipse of solar Saros series 44 in Table 10 (from about —329 to —77),

 we assume in turn that that eclipse was the eclipse of month 13, which began the 8-8

 at the descending node. Then, for the eclipses of the Saros cycle that then starts, we
 compute the total squared error over a Saros (TSEOS). This we do by taking:

 (time of an eclipse from mechanism — actual time of same eclipse)2

 and summing over the extant eclipses of the Saros cycle. We use for the "actual time"
 the time of greatest eclipse in Espenak's catalogs of eclipses, for the eclipses that
 actually occurred. For eclipses predicted but not occurring, we use the time of true

 conjunction or true opposition, from Espenak's catalog of lunar phases. In variants of

 the procedure, we may sum only over the extant lunar eclipses, or only over the extant
 solar eclipses, or we may exclude outliers.

 Figure 17 shows a TSEOS graph for solar Saros series 44. Thus, we assume, for

 each in turn, that the solar eclipse of month 13 is to be identified with one of the dates

 in Table 14, and we compare the mechanism's eclipse times with times deduced from

 modern theory. The quantity on the vertical axis is the sum of all the squared errors for

 the 18 eclipses. Now recall that, because of Figs. 12,13, and 14, we already know that

 only one of three starting dates are still candidates—these are the dates of the eclipses

 of Group 3, and they are indicated in Fig. 17 by the solid black triangles. (The hollow

 Clearly, the solar eclipse times are of lower quality. (And this is why, in Table 12, we

 included as options the bottom two rows, in which the solar eclipses are weighted by
 50 %). Even if we imagine a different epoch for the solar eclipses and associate the
 solar eclipse of month 13 with that of — 149, we would have an RMS timing error for
 the nine solar eclipses of 2.87 h—still double that of the lunar eclipses. In view of the

 Fig. 17 Total squared error over a Saros (TSEOS) graph for solar Saros series 44. Eighteen eclipses are
 used, both solar and lunar. Black triangles indicate the solutions of Group 3 (in which the eclipse times of
 the mechanism are in the correct phase relation with the actual eclipses). Thus, the solar eclipse of month
 13 most likely is to be identified with that of May, —203

 triangles are already excluded). Thus, we conclude that the eclipse of month 13 is that
 of —203 May 17. And the full moon of month 1 corresponds to —204 May 12. The
 exeligmos dial read "0" at the time of this eclipse—i.e., no 8- or 16-h corrections are
 to be applied.

 The deep, regular valley, with the well-defined minimum in Fig. 17 is again a

 confirmation that solar Saros 44 is the correct choice. For other Saros series, the minima

 are much shallower, and often there is no well-defined minimum at all. Examples of
 some of these other non-solutions are shown in Figs. 29 and 30.

 In Fig. 17, we have used 18 eclipses, both lunar and solar. Using the nine lunar

 eclipses alone gives Fig. 18. From comparison of Figs. 17 and 18, it might be surmised

 that the timing errors in the solar eclipses are greater than in the lunar eclipses. That
 this is indeed the case is confirmed by Fig. 19.

 Here are the RMS errors in the times of eclipse, assuming that indeed the solar

 eclipse of month 13 is that of —203 May 17:

 lower quality of the solar eclipse times and the broad, flat bottom in Fig. 19, we do not

 believe that one can conclude that there were different epochs for the solar and lunar
 eclipses. However, this possibility cannot be completely excluded.

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 741

 Steele (2000b, pp. 68-75) analyzes the accuracy of the predicted eclipse times
 surviving in Babylonian records. He distinguishes three categories for lunar eclipses:

 Category A, umbral lunar eclipses that were visible somewhere on the Earth's surface,

 but not necessarily at the longitude of Babylon; Category B, penumbral lunar eclipses,

 and Category F, failed predictions. He finds that the average error is for Category A

 1.31 h and for Category B 2.86 h. Steele distinguishes two categories for solar eclipses:

 Category A, solar eclipses that were visible at Babylon or would have been visible

 there if the Sun were above the horizon at the time of the eclipse (that is, eclipses that

 were visible from the latitude, but not necessarily from the longitude of Babylon); and

 Category B, eclipses that would not be visible at Babylon under any circumstance. He

 found for Category A an error of 2.01 h and for Category B an error of 3.55 h.

 The accuracy of the times of the lunar eclipses on the AM is comparable to that of

 Babylonian lunar eclipse predictions of category A. This is presumptive evidence that

 the lunar eclipse times on the AM are the results of some kind of predictive scheme—

 and not directly of observation. (We will show this more explicitly in Sect. 19).

 We have also calculated the mean timing error for the 18 eclipses (with outliers

 excluded). The result is -0.11 h, i.e., very close to zero.17 This suggests that we are

 on the right track by modeling the ancient mechanic's procedure by starting with the

 mean time of the eclipse and adding corrections. This also suggests that the eclipse
 times recorded on the mechanism's Saros dial are indeed intended to represent the

 times of mid-eclipse, which confirms a conjecture of Alexander Jones (personal com

 munication). Babylonian practice seems to have favored prediction of the onset of the

 eclipse (Steele 2000b, p. 73). So here is another example of a recasting or adaptation

 of Babylonian conventions by the maker of the Antikythera mechanism.

 Conclusion of Sect. 17 : The solar eclipse of month 13 corresponds to that of-203

 May 17. The full moon of month 1 was that of—204 May 12.

 18 Analysis of the underlying lunar and solar models

 In our attack on the dating problem, we have worked with sinusoidal forms for the

 equations of center of the Moon and Sun because these are simple to handle analyti

 cally and are more than good enough for the problem at hand. But the question does

 naturally arise as to what sort of theory underlies the eclipse times on the Antikythera

 mechanism. Geminus, a writer of the first century BCE, describes for Greek readers

 in his Introduction to the Phenomena (xviii 4-19) the essential features of the Baby

 lonian lunar theory now known as System B (Evans and Berggren 2006, pp. 96-99,
 228-230). The Moon's daily motion changes from day to day according to a sim
 ple saw-tooth pattern, with uniform daily changes of 0;18° between maximum and

 minimum daily displacements of 15; 14,35° and 11; 6,35°. (We use the Neugebauer

 notation, in which whole degrees stand to the left of the semi-colon, and successive

 sexagesimal parts stand to the right and are themselves separated by commas). This

 17 Using all 22 eclipses, we get for the mean timing error -0.73 h.

 DT - (44! 1 , 0 < f < r/2

 IHt)

 DT

 <t <T.

 q (the Moon's equation of center) is the difference between the Moon's longitude
 according to System B and the longitude it would have if it moved uniformly. The
 time t is reckoned from the moment of fastest motion ("perigee"), T is the length
 of the anomalistic month (27; 33, 20days)18, and D is the difference between the
 greatest and least daily motion (in degrees per day). The curves for q are segments of
 parabolas, alternately concave downward and concave upward, as shown in Fig. 20.
 The amplitude is plotted according to the parameters quoted by Geminus, which appear
 also in the Babylonian material (Neugebauer 1975, p. 480). A function like this one
 (with a slightly different amplitude) would model the eclipse times on the Antikythera
 mechanism about as well as would the sinusoids we have used for analysis.

 For the solar theory, the simplest Babylonian approach belongs to System A. Here,
 the Sun moves at a uniform angular speed of 30° per synodic month in the fast zone
 of the zodiac (which stretches from Virgo 13° to Pisces 27°) and 28 1/8° per synodic

 month in the slow zone. The resulting equation of center is piecewise linear, as shown

 in Fig. 21. How well would these two theories match the eclipse data from the AM?

 18 But in the analysis in this paper, we use the length of the anomalistic month that is implicit in the
 Antikythera mechanism, which is (223/239) times the synodic month. For the synodic month, we use
 365.25d(19/235). This makes no practical difference: An anomalistic month of 27.556 days for System B
 and Geminus, 27.554 days implicit in the AM.

 Fig. 22 System B style lunar theory (black curve) fitted to the eclipse times of the Antikythera mechanism
 with the solar fit removed (open diamonds), t — 0 is the opposition of month 1. Eighteen lunar and solar
 eclipses are used

 We have fitted these Babylonian-style functions to the Antikythera mechanism

 eclipse times, using 18 eclipses (9 solar and 9 lunar, with the four outliers removed).19

 We require the width of the fast zone to be 194° and that of the slow zone 166°, as in the
 Babylonian solar theory of System A. The adjustable parameters are the amplitudes
 of the solar and lunar equations of center, their phases, and ho—thus, five parameters
 as with the sinusoidal fits. The results are shown in Figs. 22 and 23. The parameters
 of the fit are as follows:

 Moon amplitude of equation of center curve: 8.88 h

 "mean anomaly"20 at opposition of month 1: 185.0°

 19 Our technique is the same as that used in Sect. 13. We compute the lunar and solar equations of center
 for the given models and assume that these need to be compensated for by the Moon and Sun running at
 their mean relative motion of 12.2°/day. Once we know the locations of the perigees, it is possible to apply
 a more sophisticated reckoning, in which we take into account the variable speeds of the Moon and Sun.
 This is done in Sect. 19.

 20 The mean anomaly does not have a clear-cut definition as an angle in this non-geometrical model. The

 parameter determined from the fit is the offset of the zero crossing from t = 0 in Fig. 22, which is 0.01392

 fit removed (open diamonds), t = 0 is the opposition of month 1. The widths of the fast and slow zones are

 were adjustable parameters for the fit

 h0 —9.39h.

 These are all comparable to the values shown in Table 12 for the sinusoidal fits.
 Visually, the quality of the Babylonian fit is good—and statistically this is borne out
 as well. The parabolic (for the Moon) and piecewise-linear (for the Sun) fits leave
 a sum of squared residuals of 53.4 h2. This is defined as: (glyph time minus time
 predicted by fit)2, summed over the 18 eclipses. For the sinusoidal fit, using the same

 18 eclipses, the residuals come to 57.0 h2. The difference is due mostly to the better
 performance of the piecewise-linear solar theory. The difference in performance is
 not large enough to prove the use of Babylonian-style theories for handling the non

 uniformity of motion, but this does seem a plausible conjecture, especially as there is

 evidence of the use of Babylonian solar theory of System A on the front side of the
 mechanism, in the differential graduation of the zodiac and Egyptian calendar scales

 of an anomalistic period. Note that at t — 0, the eclipses are slightly late and getting later; thus, the
 equation of center is slightly negative and getting more negative, i.e., we are near (and just after) apogee,
 by 0.01392 x 360° = 5.0°, hence the value 185.0°.

 2 ' The mean anomaly does not have a clear-cut definition as an angle in this non-geometrical model. The
 parameter determined directly from the fit is the t-value of the most negative point in Fig. 23, which is
 0.24084 of a year. The zero crossings of the graph are the moments when the equation of center is zero,
 which we associate with "perigee" and "apogee." As can be seen, at t = 0, the eclipses are very slightly
 early, and getting earlier. Hence, we are near, and just after, apogee. The zero crossing would have occurred
 att = —0.01028 year. Hence, we take the mean anomaly to be 0.01028 x 360° beyond apogee, i.e., 183.7°.
 Note that in this Babylonian-inspired model, the maximum and minima ate not uniformly spaced. However,
 the zero crossings are.

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 745

 (Evans et al. 2010). Moreover, given our likely epoch of -204, it is highly unlikely

 that trigonometric equations of center would have been available.

 We also tried fitting the eclipse times with an epicycle theory, for both the Sun and

 the Moon. In the case of an epicycle theory, the equation q of center can be found

 from the following relation:

 esma

 sin q

 Vl + e2 - 2e

 cos a

 where ä is the mean anomaly, measured from the perigee, and e is the ratio of the

 epicycle's radius to the radius of the deferent circle. In this case, the sum of the squared

 residuals turns out to be 61.4 h2. So the classic epicycle, characteristic of late Greek

 astronomy, does less well than simple sinusoidal fits. The reason seems to be the no

 longer 180° spacings between positive and negative peaks of q. As can be seen from

 Fig. 22, the 180°-spacings of the positive and negative peaks in the Babylonian lunar

 theory fit the eclipse times well. But again the difference is not great enough to allow

 us to reject the epicycle theory on the basis of the numbers alone.

 In fitting the piecewise-linear theory to the eclipse times, we also tried relaxing

 the Babylonian condition that the Sun's fast zone should be 194° wide and the slow
 zone 166°; thus, in a second trial, we left the relative size of these widths as a free

 parameter. We obtained: 205° and 155°, with, indeed, the fast zone broader. (This

 is reassuring, as it could have turned out the other way). The fits in this case are as
 follows:

 with residuals of 53.2h2, negligibly smaller than for the zones of Babylonian
 width.

 Moon amplitude of equation of center curve: 8.92 h

 "mean anomaly" at opposition of month 1: 185.3°

 Sun amplitude of sawtooth function: 3.99 h

 "mean anomaly" at opposition of month 1: 183.1°

 h0 -9.44 h

 The apparently poorer performance of the solar theory in all the fits (both sinu

 soidal and Babylonian) could indicate a deficiency in our method of converting the

 eclipse times of the inscriptions to modern 24-h time, or the use by the ancient
 mechanic of some tool other than epicycles or saw-tooth functions for getting the

 eclipse times of the Sun. Fortunately, this does not affect the dating problem in a

 significant way. The excellence of the lunar fit (Figs. 7 or 22) does suggest that we

 are on the right track in supposing that the eclipse times were obtained by using

 the Babylonian eclipse records to obtain the day and mean time and then applying

 an "equation of center" to correct the time. Even if Babylonian theories were used,

 as seems likely, the equation of center would presumably have to be adapted. For

 example, the maximum equation of center for Moon in system B is, as we can see in

 Fig. 20, about 7°, which translates into an advance or delay in eclipse time of nearly

 14h, instead of the more realistic value of about 10h reflected by the Antikythera
 mechanism.

 Conclusion of Sect. 18 : The eclipse times on the Saros dial would be somewhat bet

 ter fitted by equations of center based on Babylonian-style arithmetical functions

 than by epicycles. The improvement in performance by the Babylonian theories

 is not great enough to prove that they were actually used. But, given the early

 likely epoch date of the eclipse predictor, it is highly unlikely that a trigonometric

 treatment based on epicycles was used.

 19 Synthesis of eclipse times

 Geometers from antiquity to the seventeenth century often maintained that a complete

 solution of a problem required two parts, characterized by different methods—analysis

 and synthesis. In Sect. 18, we applied analytical methods to the problem of the eclipse

 times to uncover information about the underlying model. We found that Babylonian

 style arithmetical theories for the equations of center of the Moon and Sun would work

 somewhat better (in the sense of agreeing better with the inscriptions) than would an

 epicycle theory. Because of the early date of the likely epoch of the Saros dial, we

 have good reason to doubt that trigonometric functions or epicycles could have been

 involved. Moreover, we found in Sect. 13 that the lunar mean anomaly and the solar

 mean anomaly were near 180° (at apogee) at the full Moon of month 1. These results

 leave the model with little wiggle room.

 Thus, we adopt a lunar theory like that of Babylonian system B. The equation of

 center was given in Sect. 18. The excess lunar velocity ve in this theory can be found

 by differentiation with respect to t:

 d q
 „£ = - = d

 d q
 „£ = - = d

 1 _ 21_
 2 ~ T

 _3 21_
 ~2 + T

 0 < t < T/2

 , T/2 < t < T.

 (Ancient astronomers would have done it differently, but had the means to go back-and

 forth between daily velocity and accumulated distance). Recall that D is the difference

 between the maximum and minimum values of the daily velocity (in degrees per day),

 which is a characteristically Babylonian parameter, t is reckoned in days from perigee,

 and T is the length of the anomalistic month. The total angular speed of the Moon (in

 degrees per day) is

 V = V + VE,

 where v is the Moon's mean daily motion = mean speed of Moon w/r Sun + mean
 speed of Sun. Thus v = 360°/sm + 360(19/235)°/sm = 360(1 + 19/235)°/sm.
 Since 1 sm = (19/235)365.25d, we obtain for the mean daily motion of the Moon

 v = (360/365.25X235/19+ l)°/day.

 (above mean motion) for the eclipses on the Antikythera mechanism

 Because of the evidence mentioned above, we start with the Moon at apogee at the full
 Moon of month 1. Thus, the theoretical graphs of q and ve look as shown in Fig. 24a,

 b. Note that there is now only one adjustable parameter for the pair of them, namely D.

 For the Sun, the graphs look like Fig. 25a, b. We start with the Sun at apogee at

 the full Moon of month 1. Now, we must do a little figuring to cast the theory into
 a one-parameter model consistent with the overall structure of the Babylonian solar
 theory. Let Vs and Vf denote the Sun's slow and fast speeds in the two-zone theory,
 expressed for the time being in degrees per mean synodic month (°/sm). The fast
 zone has a width of 194° and the slow zone 166°. Thus, the number of synodic months

 spent in the fast zone is Np = 194/ Vp, while the number of months in the slow zone
 is Ns = 166/Vs. The sum of these must equal the number of synodic months in a

 year:

 section ends at the value t = As/2 + Ap. With these relations, the solar theory is now

 expressed in terms of a single free parameter, Vp.

 We may now easily calculate the predicted times of the eclipses according to this
 scheme. We assume that the mean time of the eclipse is equal to the local clock time

 q<L and qo were then zero. At some later eclipse, if q^ - qo is again zero, the time

 of the eclipse will be greater than t\ owing to the effects of the mean motions alone

 if q<i - qo > 0, the eclipse will occur earlier than f2- If q<i - qo < 0, the eclipse

 will occur later than t2■ Rather than dividing the difference in the equations of center

 by the constant mean relative velocity of the Moon and Sun (v^ - ü©), we divide by

 the relative velocity (t>j - Vq) that actually holds at the moment of the mean eclipse.

 (Thus, in contrast to the procedure in the earlier, preliminary investigation, we are

 explicitly taking into account the variable speeds. This is now easy to do, since we

 now know the initial values of the mean anomalies).

 In Table 15, for each eclipse in column (1), we have its time of day as given by the

 Saros dial but expressed in modern terms (2). Column (5) gives the advance in time

 of the eclipse, from the time of opposition 1, owing to the effects of mean motions

 alone (calculated as explained in Sect. 13). Columns (3) and (4) give the position of

 the mean eclipse in the anomalistic period or in the year, respectively, reckoned from
 the opposition of month 1. Columns (6M9) give , ?©, Vj, and v©, all calculated
 from the Babylonian-style theories, by the methods just explained. Then, the predicted

 time of day of an eclipse (PTD) is given in column (10) by

 PTD = time of opposition 1 + (5) - ^ ^ x 24,

 (8)-(9)

 expressed in hours (local time).

 We compute the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) by taking [column ( 10)-column

 (2)]2 and summing over all 18 eclipses. We minimize this sum with respect to the three

 free parameters, D, Vf and ho (the time of day of the opposition of month 1). The results

 are shown in Figs. 24a, b, 25a, b. Thus, one may read off the values of q^ , <jr©, u<j,
 and vq on these graphs and compare with the values given in Table 15. The results

 of the fits for the amplitudes of the equations of center are comparable to what we
 have seen before. The parameters of the fit are: ho = — 9.40h, D = 2.634°/day, and

 Vf = 29.762°/sm, all quite reasonable. The value of D corresponds to an amplitude

 of 4.54° for the lunar equation of center. The value of Vp corresponds to an amplitude

 of 2.14° for the sawtooth that is the solar equation of center function. These are in

 about the right range to function well in terms of actual phenomena. But they are a

 bit smaller than the corresponding values from standard Babylonian theory—another

 sign of adaptation by the designer of the Antikythera mechanism.

 As can be seen by comparing columns (10) and (2), or by examining Fig. 26, this

 scheme does quite well at matching the inscribed eclipse times. The agreement is

 compelling enough to give some hope that we are on the right track. Of course, some

 of the timing errors are larger than one would like to see (up to 3V2h). However, the

 —Antikythera Mechanism

 Eclipses
 Eclipses

 Fig. 26 Comparison of an eclipse prediction scheme based on Babylonian-style lunar and solar theories
 with the eclipse times given by the Antikythera mechanism

 times are given on the AM in terms of whole hours. Moreover, we have computed
 equations of center and lunar velocities for particular moments in time, while the
 ancient mechanic probably would have had a table of discrete values. There is also
 the possibility of a deficiency in our conversion of AM times to standard clock times,

 as discussed in Sect. 13. A curious feature is the fact that the five eclipses with timing
 errors near 3 h all took place either a few hours before or a few hours after midnight.
 So there could be a source of systematic error, either in our understanding of the
 ancient mechanic's procedure, or in the procedure of the ancient mechanic himself.

 Nevertheless, the performance of the Babylonian-inspired scheme is quite good: It has
 a root-mean-square discrepancy with the AM inscriptions of only 1.76h. The RMS
 discrepancies for the lunar and solar eclipses are of comparable size, 1.47 and 2.01 h,

 respectively, suggesting that similar methods were used to compute the lunar and solar

 eclipses. The minor difference in RMS discrepancies is probably not significant, given
 that we excluded more lunar than solar eclipses among the outliers.22

 We have also tried an epicycle theory—in which the variable motions of both the

 Sun and the Moon are represented by epicycles. Again, we take both the solar and lunar
 mean anomaly to be 180° at the full Moon of month 1. We compute predicted times
 exactly according to the scheme described in this section, the only difference being

 the forms of the equation of center functions. So, again there are just three parameters

 to be varied—the radii of the solar and lunar epicycles and ho- We fit the parameters
 by requiring the sum of the squared residuals (SSR) in the eclipse times to be a
 minimum. The results are r© = 0.0304, = 0.0851, ho — —9.31 h, where the radii
 of the deferent circles are taken to be unity.23 These parameters result in a graph that

 differs only very subtly from Fig. 26. Again, the epicycles (sum of squared residuals =

 58.0 h2) fit the inscriptions only a little less well than does the Babylonian-style theory

 22 The Babylonian-style method described here is actually a pretty good predictor of eclipse times: Its
 RMS discrepancy with the true eclipse times is 1.51 h.

 23 The maximum values of the equations of center corresponding to these epicycle radii are about 1.75°
 for the Sun and 4.90° for the Moon.

 (55.8 h2). Thus, while a correction to the mean times based on equations of center and

 velocities appears quite plausible, it is not possible to reject the epicycles solely on

 the basis of the goodness of fit.

 Finally, we have explored the question of whether daily velocities were really used,

 or just the mean speeds (which we used in our preliminary analysis in Sect. 13). The

 use of daily velocities does improve the fit between the theory and the AM times,

 but not by enough to be decisive. For the Babylonian-style theory, the SSR (sum of

 squared residuals) is 55.8 h2 using daily velocities, but 58.1 using the mean speeds

 only. For the epicycle theory, the SSR is 58.0h2using daily velocities but 59.8 using

 only the mean speeds.

 Conclusion of Sect. 19: An eclipse prediction scheme in which the months of the

 eclipses are taken from a Babylonian list (or 8-8-7-8-7- scheme) and the times

 of the eclipses are reckoned using equations of center and velocities based on

 Babylonian-style solar and lunar theories fits the eclipse times on the Antikythera

 mechanism well. Epicycle theories for the non-uniform motion of the Sun and

 Moon fit the AM eclipse times slightly less well, but cannot be excluded on this
 basis alone.

 20 Longitude of best fit

 We did not need a very precise value of the terrestrial longitude in order to identify

 the sequence of eclipses on the AM. No longitude at all was required in order to place
 the eclipse of month 13 in solar Saros cycle 44—this was done by means of the lunar

 anomaly. Only a rough value of the longitude was needed for ruling out Groups 1 and

 2. Also, the TSEOS graphs that were used to identify a single most likely candidate

 among the survivors of Group 3 required only a rough value of the longitude. But

 now that the eclipses on the Saros dial are identified with particular actual eclipses,

 it is possible to perform a test to establish a longitude of best fit and to verify that

 it is consistent with our previous assumption. Of course, the great body of the data

 incorporated on the Saros dial does not come directly from observation: The months of

 the eclipses come from the 8-8-7-8-7- scheme in current use, and the times of day for

 the individual eclipses were calculated from a theory. However, at root there was some

 sort of connection with observation, perhaps based on a small number of eclipses. This

 is what, after all, necessitated the occasional Babylonian recalibrations. And thus, it

 does make sense to enquire for which range of terrestrial longitudes the eclipse times

 on the AM would be in fair concordance with the phenomena.

 In Table 16, the two leftmost columns contain essential information from the

 Antikythera mechanism: the months and types of the eclipses, and their times of

 day (converted into modern 24-h time as explained in Sect. 13). The next four
 columns contain information from Espenak's catalog: lunation number, actual date,

 and actual time of the eclipse, as well as the value of AT. The identification of the

 AM eclipses with particular eclipses in Espenak depends, of course, on our demon
 stration in Sect. 17 that the solar eclipse of month 13 is that of -203 May 17. In the

 Tabic 16 Comparison of eclipse times on the Antikytheia mechanism with the actual times of the eclipses in UT, for deducing the longitude of best fit

 7th column, we have expressed Espenak's times of greatest eclipse in terms of UT
 rather than TD. These times in UT are to be compared with the times in column 2:

 Antikythera time (AT) = UT + AL, where AL is the longitude of best fit, in hours

 east of Greenwich. Thus, we form the quantity

 754 C. C. Carman, J. Evans

 And minimize it by varying A L, with the result

 18

 ]T(AT,-UT, -AL)2
 i'=l

 AL = 1.69h = 25.3°.

 Thus, the longitude of best fit is lh41m east of Greenwich, which corresponds to the

 eastern Aegean—an unsurprising result. The confidence intervals are:

 ±0.58h = ±8.7° for 67%

 ±0.98h = ±14.7° for 90%

 ±1.17h = ±17.5° for 95%.

 In words, any place within about an hour of longitude from the longitude of best fit

 would do well enough. Thus, no part of the Greek world of the eastern Mediterranean

 may be safely ruled out on the basis of the eclipse times alone. The 95 % confidence

 interval takes us from 7.8°E longitude to 42.8°. However, we note that Babylon (lon

 gitude 44.5°E) is outside this generously wide zone. Thus, it seems likely that the
 calibration of the eclipse times on the AM included a Greek component, either a

 locally observed eclipse time or, perhaps more likely, the subtraction of an hour or so

 from a Babylonian calibration.

 Figure 27 shows the eclipse times predicted by the Antikythera mechanism com

 pared with the true times at the geographical longitude of best fit. As can be seen, the

 AM does a reasonably good job of predicting the times of eclipses (RMS discrepancy

 of 2.52 h). However, the AM agrees somewhat better with the Babylonian-style theory

 of Sect. 19 (RMS discrepancy of 1.76h) than it does with the actual eclipses.

 Conclusion of Sect. 20: The geographical longitude of best fit to the eclipse times

 is 1.69h (25.3°) east of Greenwich, roughly in the middle of the Greek cultural

 zone. But even at the longitude of best fit, the Antikythera mechanism agrees better

 with the Babylonian-style theory described in Sect. 19 than it does with the real

 eclipses.

 21 Casting the net more broadly

 Until now, we have assumed that the Saros dial eclipse pattern was inspired by Baby
 lonian records, or, at least, was consistent with some Babylonian conventions. In this

 section, we will show that we arrive at exactly the same result without assuming

 knowledge of the details of Babylonian eclipse theory. In "Appendix 3," we show that
 eclipse 13S is necessarily a D). We will use just this datum plus the result of Sect. 13,
 based on the lunar and solar anomaly analysis (which is independent of any assump
 tion of Babylonian influence), to show that, nevertheless, our candidate of —204 is
 still the only one possible. This section, therefore, could be understood as an alterna
 tive to Sect. 12 for those readers who question the dependence of the Saros dial on
 Babylonian conventions.

 Figure 28 is similar to Fig. 11, but now we assume that the eclipse pattern 8-8-7
 8-7- could start from any Di, not just a Dj that is attested in Babylonian records as
 beginning a 8-8-7-8-7- or a D( that the Espenak catalog suggests could function well
 as the first eclipse of an 8-8-7-8-7- scheme. So, for many of these possibilities, the
 eclipse scheme would not function very well (meaning that it would generate many

 eclipse possibilities where there were no eclipses at all), but this is not problematic: It
 only shows that we are considering a much wider set of possibilities. From Fig. 28, it
 is clear that, besides solar Saros series 44, there is just one other series for which the

 lunar anomaly at the opposition of month 1 is close to 180°: solar Saros series 50, for
 years close to year 0.

 Therefore, we would not be able to exclude series 50 on the basis of the lunar

 anomaly alone. Nevertheless, series 50 may be ruled out in a number of ways. Perhaps,
 the easiest way to see this is to make a total squared error over a Saros (TSEOS) graph
 for Saros series 50, which is shown in Fig. 29. We let each Di solar eclipse in Saros
 series 50 function (in turn) as a candidate for the eclipse of month 13. When we have
 assumed that a given Di eclipse is 13S, it is an easy matter, just by counting months,
 to identify each other eclipse on the AM Saros dial with a particular eclipse in the
 Espenak catalog. But once we choose a series 50 eclipse for month 13, we must still
 specify whether to take the times on the Antikythera mechanism as we find them, or

 to add 8 h to them, or to add 16, corresponding to the three possible positions of the
 exeligmos dial. Then, for each choice that we make (of the eclipse at month 13 and

 local Aegean time) from the glyph time and square the difference. These differences

 are added up for all 18 eclipses. The result is plotted as a single point in Fig. 29. For
 each predicted and actually occurring eclipse, the glyph time was compared with the

 time of greatest eclipse, in UT. If an eclipse did not actually occur, the glyph time was

 compared with the time of true conjunction or true opposition, expressed in UT.

 As can be seen, we obtain three curves. For example, if we suppose that the eclipse

 of -66 fell in month 13, we can either add Oh to all the AM times (black point),

 add 8h (gray) or add 16h (white). These three points for -66 lie on three different

 curves. Points lying on a single curve are all consistent with one another as far as the

 calibration of the exeligmos dial goes, but assume different eclipses for month 13. The

 TSEOS graphs for series 50 show no well-defined minimum at all, and the total error

 is much higher than for Saros series 44. No calibration of the exeligmos dial is strongly

 preferred. Saros series 50 is rejected. (In "Appendix 7," we also prove that Saros 50

 is inconsistent with the requirements imposed by the solar and lunar equations on the

 time of year and time of day of the opposition of month 1).

 But now let us cast the net more widely yet: We abandon also the requirement

 that the lunar anomaly should be near 180° at the opposition of month 1. In Fig. 30,
 we plot TSEOS graphs for all extant solar Saros series producing eclipses at the
 descending node. For each Di that occurs in the Espenak catalog, we give that eclipse

 an opportunity to compete for the role of eclipse 13S. Then, we compute the total

 squared error in the eclipse times, summed over all 18 (excluding the outliers) eclipses

 on the dial. In constructing the graph, we use for the "actual time" of the eclipse the

 time of true conjunction or true opposition. (This has the advantage that we may treat

 uniformly eclipses that really occurred and eclipses that were predicted but did not

 occur). And we use, as before, the longitude correction of lh35m to pass from UT to

 "local Antikythera time."

 For each Di eclipse that is a candidate to be 13S, we of course have to do this

 three times, because in each run, we must choose whether to use all eighteen glyph
 times just as they come from the AM, or to add 8 h to all of them, or to add 16 h

 to all of them. In Fig. 30, solid black points indicate that the AM times are used

 directly, with nothing added to them. Gray points indicate that 8 h have been added to
 all the AM times. Hollow white points indicate that 16 h have been added to all the
 times.

 In Fig. 30, it will again be seen that each solar Saros series gives rise to three

 graphs, corresponding to the three possible calibrations of the exeligmos dial. For

 example, Saros series 44 has one very low-lying graph. There is also a high-lying

 graph, and a graph that starts out at mid-level but rises steeply. In all three of the
 series 44 graphs, each eclipse in the horizontal row "Series 44" of Table 10 gets its

 chance to compete for the role of 13S. Thus, each single point on a series 44 curve of

 Fig. 30 corresponds to selecting one of the possible eclipses from the series 44 row

 of Table 10 to be 13S. It will be seen that for the eclipse of -203 May, on the lowest

 lying series 44 curve, the corresponding point is black. On the high-lying series 44

 curve, the -203 point is gray. And on the rising curve, the same point is white. Starting

 from a given date, on one curve the points run black, gray, white,... ; on another they

 run gray, white, black, ...; and on the third they run white, black, gray,.... Thus, in

 this one figure, we have allowed all Di eclipses (from any of ten extant Saros series)
 to compete for the role of 13S and, for each of these cases, we have considered all

 three possible positions of the exeligmos dial. Solar Saros series 44 stands out as

 unique. No other choice gives such a low-lying error curve, with a deeply defined
 minimum.

 Conclusion of Sect. 21: Even if we discard the assumption that the solar eclipse
 of month 13 was drawn from the boldfaced candidates in Table 12 and cast

 the net much more broadly, all solar Saros series except 44 can be eliminated.

 Consequently, we are left with the unique date of—203 May 17 for eclipse 13S.

 22 Some confirming evidence

 22.1 Date of the opposition of month 1 deduced from the solar anomaly

 In establishing the epoch of the Saros dial, we used a sort of sieve of Eratosthenes

 to systematically remove possibilities, until we were left with a single date. In this

 approach, the lunar mean anomaly played a key role, as it allowed us to rule out all but

 solar Saros series 44 for the eclipse of month 13. But we did not need or make any use

 of the solar equation of center. The solar fit, however, provides important confirming
 evidence.

 If we take the longitude of the Sun's apogee to be about 65.5°, which was Hip

 parchus's value, and which, more importantly, was about right for the era of the

 Antikythera mechanism, the mean longitude of the Sun at the opposition of month

 1 would be in the range 35°-66°.24 These longitudes correspond to dates of roughly

 April 26 to May 27 (Julian calendar). That is, according to the result of fitting the
 solar equation of center, the full Moon of month 1 should have been between late

 April and late May. This is in good agreement with the result of matching the absolute

 times of eclipses, which gave us the full Moon of -204 May 12 as the best fit for
 month 1. Thus, the surviving material is redundant—there is more than the minimum

 necessary for establishing an epoch. It is important that two different approaches lead
 to concordant results.

 In looking at the TSEOS graphs of Figs. 17 or 18, one can see that —203 is favored

 for the solar eclipse of month 13, but are —257 and -149 so far from the bottom of

 the well that they must be excluded? Adopting either of these dates would give trouble

 with the requirement that opposition of month 1 lies between April 26 and May 27.

 For example, if we pick the eclipse of -149 June 19 for month 13, the full Moon of

 month 1 would be that of 150 June 14, which is too late in the year. Similarly, if we

 pick the eclipse of -257 April 15 for month 13, then the full Moon of month 1 would

 be that of -258 April 10, too early in the year. Thus, the interlocking requirements

 of the TSEOS graphs and the solar anomaly analysis provide a tightly constrained
 solution.

 24 Recall that X = â + n, where for the Sun we may put n = 65.5° - 180°. Thus, X = â - 114.5°. For

 the arbitrary value of the solar mean anomaly â, put in any of the initial values of the mean solar anomaly
 <Pq from column 5 of Table 12. For example, if we use <pq = 175.5°, we find X = 61.0° for the mean
 longitude of the Sun at the opposition of month 1.

 22.2 Value of ho

 As mentioned in Sect. 13, the parameter ho, found by fitting the lunar and solar

 anomalies, represents the time of day of the opposition of month 1. Our result was

 between 14:35 and 16:02, in the local time appropriate to the Antikythera mechanism.

 We also found that the opposition of month 1 best corresponds to that of—204 May 12.

 Consulting Espenak (Six Millennium Catalog of Phases of the Moon) on the NASA

 Eclipse Web Site, we find that the full Moon of -204 May 12 fell at 13:21 UT. For the

 meridian appropriate to the Antikythera mechanism, we use 25.3° E, the longitude of

 best fit from Sect. 20. (Here are some representative longitudes that help define the

 Greek cultural zone: Alexandria 29.9°E, Athens, 23.7°, Syracuse 15.3°E). Converting

 from UT to "Antikythera mechanism time," we find that the full Moon of —204 May 12

 fell at 13:21 + (25.3/15)h = 15:02. This would be the local time for 25.3°E longitude.

 We could add 18m for Alexandria, or subtract 40m for Syracuse and still be very close

 to the required zone. In short, the required time of the opposition of month 1 is a very

 good match to the opposition of —204 May 12.

 22.3 The fiducial mark25

 Most of the moving parts of the mechanism were actuated by gears driven by a single

 input. However, one part had to be moved by hand. This is the Egyptian calendar ring,

 which was divided into the 12 months (30 days each) and five additional days of the

 Egyptian year. Because the Egyptian calendar year was always 365 days long, with no

 leap days, the calendar ring had to be displaced "by hand" by one day every 4 years.
 Beneath the Egyptian calendar ring is a circle of closely spaced holes drilled into the

 underlying plate. There was probably a little post (or posts) on the back of the calendar

 ring. The ring could therefore be pulled off, turned to the appropriate orientation for

 the year under consideration, and then plugged back in.

 On the plate just outside the Egyptian calendar scale, near the beginning of the

 month of Payni, is an apparently engraved radial mark. Price (1974, pp. 19-20) argued

 that this was a fiducial mark for setting the Egyptian calendar ring for some initial

 date. But in his analysis Price assumed that the calendar ring is still in its original

 position and, when this led to impossible dates, that it was set at the correct day of the

 month, but the wrong month of the year. However, as is known, the Egyptian calendar

 ring is out of its proper position by several months for the epoch of the Antikythera

 mechanism, so no inference can be drawn from the day of the year that now happens

 to lie against the fiducial mark. But, since the mark is inscribed on the same plate as

 the zodiac, something interesting can be said about the zodiac degree corresponding

 to the mark. To be sure, the X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans show that the

 plate in the vicinity of the mark is badly cracked, so one could wonder whether this is

 a deliberately made mark or some sort of damage.

 We point out that the fiducial mark is almost perfectly radial. (See Evans and

 Carman (2014), Figure 1 on p. 155). The radial direction of the mark supports the

 On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor 761

 view that it is indeed associated with the scales. Like Price, we ask whether it might

 have been intended as the "t = 0" setting mark for the Egyptian calendar ring. Of

 course, it could be conceivable to prescribe the setting of the calendar ring without

 the use of a separate fiducial mark, if, for example, there were an inscription that

 said: for such and such a year, place 1 Thoth against a certain degree of the zodiac.

 We are lucky in the portion of the zodiac that is preserved, amounting to approxi

 mately a quadrant. For the Sun's position on the first of Thoth fell in the extant portion
 of the zodiac between the years -424 and -71. This encompasses practically the
 whole range of possible dates for the construction of the Antikythera mechanism,

 except perhaps for a very few years at the most recent end of the interval, imme

 diately before the shipwreck. Thus, if there were a calibration mark for the first of

 Thoth, it would almost certainly have to fall in the preserved portion of the zodiac.

 There is one, and only one, such mark visible in the CT and, as there is only one,

 it is likely the setting mark for the calendar scale. But we acknowledge that in the

 research community, opinion is divided about whether this mark is intentional or
 accidental.

 Let us enquire for just which year the beginning of Thoth would be aligned with

 the fiducial mark. In the list below, for each year in column 1, column 2 indicates

 the Julian calendar date corresponding to 1 Thoth, taken from Bickerman (1980, pp.
 115-112). Column 3 gives the longitude of the Sun calculated from modern theory

 for noon of 1 Thoth in the given year, at 23° East longitude. For AT we used 3V4*1,

 which is appropriate for the years around -200.

 The fiducial mark lies at about Libra 17.7°, i.e., longitude 197.7°, according to the

 modern convention, which assigns to the first mark of Libra the value 0°. However,

 it is probable that the ancient mechanic considered the long mark at the beginning

 of Libra to represent Libra 1°, which means the fiducial mark corresponds to 198.7°.

 To allow for either possibility, we look for years in which the Sun's noon longitude

 on the first of Thoth falls in the range from about 197.2°-199.2° (thus allowing half
 a day one way or another about noon for either possibility). As can be seen, the

 result is the range —213 to —205 (bold print in the table). But we do not know just

 how the ancient mechanic would have calculated solar longitudes for this calendrical

 problem. Would he simply have used mean longitudes, for example? Moreover, how

 accurate was the equinox or solstice date that was used to tie the Sun to the calendar?

 If we allow a total of 21/2° (roughly the size of the maximum solar equation) above

 198.7° and below 197.7°, we look for years for which the Sun's longitude at local

 noon on the first of Thoth fell in the broader range 195.2°—201.2°. This gives us the

 more conservative estimate of -221 to -197. That the fiducial mark gives a range

 of years that includes our likely epoch for the Saros dial may be taken as supporting

 evidence—but only, of course, if one believes in the interpretation of this mark that
 we have sketched.

 Now, as we have seen, the middle of month 1 of the Saros dial fell in the month

 of May. But the first month of the Metonic dial is Phoinikaios, the first month of the

 civil year in the family of calendars related to the calendar of Corinth. Strong evidence

 requires this month to fall in August or September (Paul Iversen and John Morgan,

 personal communication; Iversen 2013; Morgan 2013). Thus, it is clear that the first
 month of the Saros dial and the first month of the Metonic dial do not correspond to

 the same month. This was a surprise to us, and at first a disappointment, as we had

 hypothesized that the two dials would begin at "month 1" together. This also would

 have had great simplifying advantages in the search for an epoch. But in fact the two

 pointers do not start off together, with each pointing to the first month of its spiral on

 "day 1." As we have seen, there is a simple and plausible explanation for the choice

 guiding the structure of the Saros dial: At the full Moon of month 1, both the Moon

 and the Sun were at apogee. The first cell of the Metonic dial is, naturally enough, the

 first month of the civil year.

 Now, does the fiducial mark correspond to the epoch of the Saros dial or to the epoch

 of the Metonic dial? The fiducial mark connects the (approximately) solar year of the

 Egyptians with the Sun's motion around the zodiac. Since the Greek luni-solar year

 is also tied to the zodiac (with some sloshing back-and-forth in accordance with the

 19-year Metonic cycle), the fiducial mark can be understood as providing a statement

 about calendars. In a way it provides the link between the Egyptian and the Greek

 calendar, through the intermediary of the zodiac. There is no reason why it should

 have anything to do with the Saros cycle directly.

 Thus, we believe that the fiducial mark indicated the zodiac position of the first of

 Thoth in year 1 of a certain Metonic cycle. In this paper, we have given strong evidence

 for putting the first month of the Saros dial in -204. The fiducial mark (if such it is)

 suggests a Metonic cycle that began between -221 and -197. Of course, there is no
 reason for there to be a direct connection between a Metonic and a Saros cycle. They

 run with their own periods (19years versus about 18years and 11 days). And if one is

 constrained to start at the beginning of the civil year and the other to start when the

 Sun and Moon are both at apogee, it would require nearly a miracle to have them start

 Now, there were two plausible choices for the reckoning of years in terms of Metonic

 cycles. The ancient mechanic might conceivably have reckoned from -431, the year
 of Meton and Euctemon's famous summer solstice. Or he might have reckoned from

 out together.

 -329, the first year of the first Callippic cycle, a reform and extension of what Meton

 had started. For reckoning by Meton, new 19-year cycles would begin in -222 and

 —203 (these are the only choices within, or nearly within, the limits —221 to —197).
 For reckoning by Callippus, new 19-year cycles would begin in —215 and —196.
 The Callippic convention should probably be preferred here, in view of the fact that

 an inscription on the mechanism mentions the 76-year (Callippic) period, and it is

 believed that a subsidiary dial on the mechanism indicated the place of the current 19

 year cycle within the 76-year period (Freeth et al. 2006). -215 was, of course, within

 the lifetime of Archimedes, which will either tantalize one with possibilities or repel

 one as wildly improbable. -196 is slightly outside our range of likely interpretations

 of the fiducial mark, but not so far outside as to justify rejection.

 Conclusion of Sect. 22: Three pieces of supporting evidence are offered. (1) The

 fit to the solar equation of center implies that the opposition of month 1 fell

 between April 26 and May 27 (Julian calendar), which is in accord with the date

 determined from fitting the absolute times of the eclipses. (2) The parameter ho

 implies that the opposition of month 1 occurred between 14:35 and 16:02 local

 time. This is a good fit to the actual time of the opposition of-204 May 12. (3)

 The fiducial mark (if it is genuine) may indicate the position of the first ofThoth

 for the first year of a Metonic cycle that began between -221 and -197.

 23 Summary and dosing discussion

 If we assume that the solar and lunar eclipses were placed on the Saros dial in con

 formity with Babylonian 8-8-7-8-7- patterns, then 14 different reconstructions are

 consistent with the extant eclipse glyphs. If we invoke the Babylonian convention that

 the 8-8- of a solar Saros scheme should start at the descending node and that the 8-8

 of a lunar Saros scheme should start with the Moon at the ascending node, and if we

 make use of the apparent fact that the southernmost solar eclipses of each diagonal

 sequence were omitted, these 14 combinations are reduced to a single solution, which
 we call Iß.

 The eclipse predictor of the Antikythera mechanism works best if the full Moon of

 month 1 of the Saros dial corresponds to -204 May 12. This we shall refer to as the

 likely epoch of the eclipse predictor. Further, the exeligmos dial should read zero for

 the Saros cycle starting on -204 May 12.

 The solar eclipse of month 13 belongs to solar Saros series 44 (this particular result

 is very strong, the strongest result of this investigation), and the eclipse predictor will

 work best if this is the eclipse of -203 May 17.

 At the epoch, both the solar anomaly and the lunar anomaly were close to zero

 measured in the ancient way from apogee (or close to 180° if measured from perigee

 in the modern way). The lunar anomaly alone is enough to secure the dating. But the

 solar equation also implies that the first cell of the Saros dial corresponded roughly to

 May, which provides confirmation for the dating by means of the lunar anomaly.

 Calendrical evidence implies that the first month of the Metonic dial probably

 corresponds to August or September. Thus, the first cell of the Metonic dial and the

 first cell of the Saros dial do not represent the same month.

 The relation between the lunar and solar eclipses follows the alternative Steele rule.

 This suggests that the adaptor drew on a Babylonian solar eclipse list that had already

 moved over to a new calibration, but a lunar eclipse list that was still running on the

 previous calibration.

 In Sect. 21, we were able to find a likely epoch date without making use of Table 10

 (the list of eclipses historically used by the Babylonians to start a solar 8-8-). The epoch

 nevertheless agrees with the epoch we found using the Babylonian record. Some extra

 robustness is therefore lent to the epoch date determined.

 It is plausible and perhaps likely, but not possible to prove statistically, that the

 corrections to the mean times of the eclipses were done on the basis of Babylonian

 style "equations of center"—a quadratic form for the Moon and a piecewise-linear form

 for the Sun. Given the likely epoch of the eclipse predictor, it is reasonable to exclude

 a trigonometric equation of center, since the likely epoch is before the development of

 trigonometry. In any case, a method of prediction based on Babylonian-style equations

 of center and the associated daily velocities reproduces the eclipse times of the AM

 rather well. The eclipse times on the AM agree better with the results of this prediction

 scheme than they agree with the real times of the eclipses.

 The geographical longitude of best fit (obtained by matching the AM eclipse times

 to the actual times of the eclipses) corresponds to the Aegean Sea with an uncertainty

 of about an hour of longitude.

 What was the likely date of fabrication? The eclipse predictor works best for the

 years -204 to -186. It could run for a couple of Saros cycles before or after that, using
 the 8- and 16-h corrections from the exeligmos wheel, but the eclipse times would
 be less accurate. Was the machine fabricated in advance of -204, with the idea that

 it would be at its prime from -204 to -186? This would suggest a fabrication date
 somewhat before -204. Or were eclipse data compiled during the Saros of -204 to

 -186 (which would perhaps explain why the eclipses best fit this period)? This would
 imply a construction somewhat after —186. And, of course, we cannot exclude the

 possibility that a Greek mechanic used an old and outdated eclipse list, hoping that

 the 8-h rule would keep it relevant to his own day.

 While it is not possible to be certain, there are pieces of evidence that bear on the

 issue. The solar eclipse predictor follows one calibration of the Saros scheme, but

 the lunar eclipse predictor was still running on an older calibration. This suggests a

 fabrication date reasonably close to a Babylonian recalibration of the Saros scheme.

 The approximate dates of these recalibrations are shown in Table 10—thus sometime

 around -261, around —203, or around -109. But the timing errors of the eclipses

 would be significantly larger around -261, and very much larger around -109. Again,
 -203 looks like the best candidate.

 Also, it would not have been possible to construct an entire sequence of solar and

 lunar eclipse times based on observations over one Saros cycle (from —204 to -184,

 say), as too few of the eclipses would be visible from any one place; so this suggests

 prediction form theory, which means that there is no strong reason to prefer a date

 after -184. Moreover, for the Babylonians, observed times were frequently expressed

 in terms of the interval between the beginning of the eclipse and sunrise or sunset

 (Steele 2000b, pp. 57-58), often measured in terms of the us (or "time degree," which

 is one 360th of the day and night). And, according to Steele (2000b, p. 66), a typical

 Babylonian eclipse timing, running, e.g., for about 2h40m has an accuracy of about

 ±24m, which is quite a bit better than the typical timing errors for predicted eclipses.

 Thus, we can see that Babylonian records of observed eclipse times would not have

 been in a form that could have been easily or directly used. And, if the eclipse times

 of the AM were based directly on observations, the timing errors should be smaller

 than they are.

 By contrast, as we have seen, the errors in the eclipse times are of about the right

 size to be consistent with prediction. Thus, while we cannot be certain, a plausible

 inference is that the eclipse times were predicted to run for the Saros cycle -204
 to -184, which suggests a fabrication time close to -204, and possibly somewhat
 before. Finally, the fiducial mark suggests the mechanism was keyed to a Metonic

 cycle that began within about ±12 years of -209.

 There are more data extant on the Saros dial than the minimum needed to establish

 a likely epoch; the resulting crosschecks make the epoch date reasonably strong.

 Because the conclusions drawn in this paper are so tightly constrained, it would be

 easy to check them and to refute or refine them if more fragments of the Saros dial

 should ever come to light.

 Acknowledgments We are grateful to James Bernhard for a discussion of statistical issues. Alexander

 Jones generously shared preliminary results of his own unpublished research which disclosed the existence

 of a lunar equation of center embedded in the Antikythera mechanism eclipse times. This turned out to be

 crucial for our project—it is the lunar anomaly that allows one to unambiguously identify a particular solar

 Saros series. Dennis Duke gave valuable help in calculation and programming. We thank John Steele for
 answering our questions about the Babylonian Saros schemes. We thank Paul Iversen and John Morgan for

 their lively and helpful discussion of previous versions of the paper. The Antikythera Mechanism Research

 Project has, as always, been extremely generous in sharing images and data. James Evans expresses his

 thanks to the University of Puget Sound for research funds that helped make this work possible. Christian

 Carman would like to express his thanks for the support of Research Project PICT-2010-0319 of the Agencia

 Nacional de Promociön Cientffica y Tecnolögica of Argentina. While we were in the last stages of completing

 our manuscript, an article by Tony Freeth was published that focuses on some of the same issues that we

 have studied (Freeth 2014), but it appeared too late for us to make any use of it. The work published here

 is independent of Dr. Freeth's study.

 24 Appendix 1: The possible distributions of lunar eclipses on the Saros dial

 In their study of the lunar eclipses, Freeth et al. rightly remark that the critical factor

 in the analysis is where the 5-month intervals are. So, in their analysis, they fix one

 of the "1-" groups, identifying two 5-month intervals, one between months 79 and 84

 and the other between 120 and 125. Then, they say,

 Therefore any Babylonian scheme that is consistent with the glyphs must have
 5-month [intervals] between Months 79 and 84 and between months 120 and

 125. This fixes one of the '7's in the 8-7-8-7-8 pattern and it is easy to see that

 this then fixes the whole Babylonian pattern relative to the glyphs (Freeth et al.
 2008, p. 32).

 766 C. C. Carman, J. Evans

 But it is not correct to suppose that knowing one of the "7-" groups is enough for fixing

 the whole pattern. In the Babylonian scheme, there are two different '7-" groups—

 one followed by two groups of 8 eclipses and the other followed by only one—so it is

 necessary to know which of the two '7-" groups has been identified. Thus, it turns out

 that there is not just one possible distribution of lunar eclipses that is consistent with

 the Babylonian scheme and with the inscriptions on the Antikythera mechanism, but
 rather two different distributions, which are in Table 1.

 25 Appendix 2: The possible distributions of solar eclipses

 Solar EPs are inscribed in months 13, 25, 72, 78, 119, 125, 131, 137, 172, 178, and

 184. As Freeth et al. noted, between cell 184 and cell 13 (carrying forward beyond the

 end of the 223-month dial into the beginning of the next Saros cycle), there must be

 two 4-month gaps. For between cell 184 and cell 13 are cells for 51 months, which

 means that we have room for an "8," plus 2 4-month gaps (one before and one after

 the "8"). Alternatively, we could have a "7", plus 2 4-month gaps (one before and

 one after the "7"), plus six extra months that would belong to the next or the previous

 group. Thus, the 2 4-month gaps could be separated either by an "8" or by a "7".

 Case i Suppose that the 2 4-month gaps are separated by an "8." Then, the 4-month

 gaps must be at the extremes, i.e., one just before month 13 and the other

 just after month 184. So, the 2 4-month gaps consist of months 9-12 and

 185-188. And there is an "8" from 189 through 8. All three solutions under

 Case i satisfy these conditions.

 The Saros pattern takes the form 8-8-7-8-7- (or a cyclic permutation thereof).
 So we will have sub-cases, depending on which of the three possible positions

 is taken by the "8" that occupies cells 189 through 8. We must allow for the

 possibility that this "8" is:

 the second "8" of two successive "8"s (subcase 1)

 or the first "8" of two successive "8"s (subcase 2)

 or the lone "8" (subcase 3).

 Suppose, alternatively, that the two 4-month gaps (between cell 184 and cell 13) are

 separated by a "7". Then, we have two additional cases:

 Case ii One of the 4-month gaps is just after month 184, and is followed by the

 "7". Thus, there is a '7" from 189 through 2. Both solutions under Case ii

 satisfy this condition. This "7" is either:

 the "7" that follows two successive "8"s (subcase 4)

 or the "7" that follows a lone "8" (subcase 5).

 Case iii One of the 4-month gaps is just before 13 and is preceded by the '7". Thus,

 there is a "7" from 195 through 8. Both solutions under Case iii satisfy this
 condition. This "7" is either:

 the "7" that follows two successive "8"s (subcase 6)

 or the "7" that follows a lone "8" (subcase 7).

 So, to sum up, there are seven solar patterns that would be consistent with the extant

 glyphs and with a Babylonian-style 8-8-7-8-7- distribution scheme and these are shown
 in Table 2.

 26 Appendix 3: Alternative determination of the A and D nodes for the solar

 eclipses

 We mentioned above that in the Babylonian Saros record the first eclipse of an 8

 8- group is consistently a D (an eclipse at the descending node). But there are no

 astronomical reasons for that. It is clearly a convention, because the first eclipse of an

 8-8- group could just as well be an A. So, if we do not want simply to assume that

 the Saros dial of the Antikythera mechanism was based on the Babylonian records,

 we have to explore both possibilities. The sequence actually followed by Babylonian

 records, starting with a D eclipse at the beginning of the 8-8-, is represented in the

 left-most column of Table 9. The alternative sequence, starting with an A eclipse, can

 be obtained by exchanging A for D in the same column.

 Now, we know that the solar eclipse in month 13 comes 11 months after a solar

 eclipse in month 2. (For all seven possible solar solutions require an eclipse in month

 2). Only eclipses that are first or second in the 8- or 7- groups are 11 months after

 another EP. Thus, whether we start the 8-8- with a D or with an A, we will always

 have an Ai and Dj as the first two EP. (What will change is the order—either Di Ai or

 Ai Di). Now, applying the omission rule, we know that Ai eclipses must be omitted;

 but the eclipse in month 13 is an extant eclipse: Consequently, it is a Dj. Therefore,

 no matter which of the seven solar patterns were adopted for Saros dial, and no matter

 whether the 8-8- began with an A or a D, we can be sure that the eclipse in month 13
 is aDi.

 27 Appendix 4: Examples of 24-h correction analysis applied to the inscribed

 eclipse times

 For example, consider eclipses 78S and 119S (solar eclipses in months 78 and 119):

 By virtue of the number of anomalistic months elapsed from the opposition of month

 251° greater than the mean anomaly at the opposition of month 20 (in the case of

 eclipse 78S) and 230° greater than the mean anomaly at the opposition of month 20

 (in the case of eclipse 119S). Thus, the effect of the lunar anomaly on the time shift

 between these two eclipses was small. The inscribed glyphs show that the time of day

 of eclipse 78S advanced by 7 h from the time of day recorded for eclipse 20M (the

 lunar eclipse of month 20). The number of synodic months elapsed from 20M implies

 that the time of day for eclipse 78S should have shifted forward by 13.31h due to the
 mean motions alone. Thus, the advance in time over and above the effect of the mean

 motions was 7 — 13.31 = — 6.3lh, for eclipse 78S. Similarly, the advance in time of

 eclipse 119S with respect to 20M, over and above the effect of the mean motions was

 -2.67h. The "signal" that we are trying to explain consists of the numbers in column
 (5)—the advance in time over and above the effect of the mean motions. Now, we

 have chosen two eclipses at which the lunar mean anomalies were similar; thus, the

 effect of the lunar anomaly on the signal is small. The two values in column (5) should

 rarely differ by more than 8 h, which is the maximum effect of the solar anomaly.

 The difference between -6.31 and —2.67 is <8h, so we may be confident that no

 correction is required to the times in column (3).

 But now consider eclipses 25S, 137S, 172M and 178S:

 These have lunar mean anomalies that span a narrow range of about 21°. So it is clear

 that the difference in the glyph times between 20M and 172M must be treated as 24 h

 and not Oh. If we took it as Oh, then the values in column (5) for 137S and 172M would

 differ by over 13i/2h, which is out of the realm of possibility. Now, with column (3)

 for 172M chosen to be 24 h, it is true that the values in column (5) for 137S and 172M

 differ by 10V2h, a bit more than the 8-h maximum effect for the solar anomaly. But

 the lunar anomalies for these two eclipses differ by about 9°, so the maximum possible

 lunar effect on the time shift is about 1011 sin(9°) = 11/2 h; thus a total lunar plus solar

 effect of up to 91/2 h is conceivable, which is perhaps close enough to the attested

 10i/2h difference. For, we should certainly allow for the possibility of some scattered

 error (which, in view of the uncertainties about the time conversion, discussed above,

 could easily amount to an hour or somewhat more). Thus, all four eclipses are in decent

 accord, but only if we put column (3) at 24 h for 172M.

 Consider one last example involving the eclipses 137M and 178M:

 Using the recorded advances in time with respect to 20M (1 lh for the first eclipse
 and 3h for the second) gives values in column (5) that differ by some 14.38h. This
 far exceeds the 8-h maximum for the solar effect. Even when we add in a maximum

 possible lunar effect of 10h sin(21°) = 3.58h, for the lunar anomalistic difference of
 21°, we could only hope to explain a difference of 111/2h in column (5). Thus, it is
 clear that either 24 h needs to be subtracted for 137M in column (3), or 24 h added for

 178M. Deciding which is required involves fitting these two eclipses into the larger

 pattern.

 28 Appendix 5: Identification of outliers

 We suspect that, for several of the month cells, there is something wrong with the times
 of the eclipses inscribed on the Saros dial, perhaps a copying error or a calculation
 error.

 Figure 31 displays the time by which each of 18 eclipses arrived early or late,
 by comparison with what would be expected from mean motions alone. The time is
 reckoned in synodic months from the opposition of month 1. So the basic signal we

 are trying to explain has an amplitude of some 10-15 h.

 In Fig. 32, we have plotted the data of Fig. 31 minus the lunar equation of center

 function. The graph therefore displays the residuals left over after the lunar equation of

 center is taken into account. The tightening of the plot shows overwhelming evidence
 of the existence of a lunar equation of center function in the basic data.

 In Fig. 33, we plot the data of Fig. 31 minus the sum of the lunar and solar equations

 of center. The further tightening of the residuals (between Figs. 32, 33) is evidence
 of the existence of the solar equation of center in the basic data. Figure 34 is the
 same as Fig. 33, except that the four eclipses excluded as outliers (13S, 120M, 125M,
 and 184M) have been added to the figure and are represented by the hollow squares.
 (The solar and lunar fits are still determined by the eclipses represented by the 18
 diamonds). Eclipses 13S and 125M are so out of character with the rest of the data,
 that their exclusion seems quite justifiable. For 120M and 184M, the case is less clear
 cut. We exclude them for having residuals >5h. The exclusion of these four eclipses
 produces a considerable improvement in the quality of the lunar fit (Fig. 7 contrasted
 with Fig. 9), which is a stronger argument for their validity than the improvement
 produced in the solar fit (Fig. 8 compared with Fig. 10). However, we present our
 results both with and without the exclusion of these outliers.

 equations have been fitted using 18 eclipses represented by the solid black diamonds. The hollow black
 squares show the data points for the excluded eclipses 13S, 120M, 125M, and 184M

 Alexander Jones (personal communication) independently found that the times
 of eclipses 13S, 125M, and 184M are problematical. The identification of outliers

 depends to some extent on the method used. He also finds that 172M is problematical
 (while we found 120M). In Fig. 14, 172M is the point with largest positive value
 and seems unproblematical; and in Fig. 33, it is the point with the greatest positive
 value, but does not really seem to be an outlier. A key point of technique is that it is
 important to fit the solar and lunar equations of center simultaneously. One will not

 get the correct fits by fitting the lunar equation first and then fitting the solar equation

 to the residuals, since these two functions are not orthogonal.

 29 Appendix 6: The Babylonian node conventions and the Britton and Steele

 rules

 As we have seen, the Babylonians put the first solar EP of an 8-8- consistently at the

 descending node D. And, after about —250, they put the lunar EP that starts the lunar
 8-8- at the A node. We shall prove that this necessarily entails the Steele rule or the
 alternative Steele rule. On the other hand, if we keep the solar EP that starts the solar

 8-8-7-8-7- at D, but also choose to place the lunar EP that starts the lunar 8-8-7-8-7
 at D, this necessarily entails the Britton rule. Thus, the node conventions discussed in

 Sect. 6 are intimately linked with the Steele and Britton rules discussed in Sect. 5.

 Let us reckon the solar eclipse pattern from the first eclipse in the solar 8-8-, at a

 moment we shall call time 0. And we shall measure time in synodic months (sm). The

 solar eclipse at the beginning of the 8-8- will of course be the most northerly Di. We

 shall then prove that (a) if we want to start the lunar pattern from the most southerly
 Ai, we must necessarily follow Steele rule (or the alternative Steele rule). But, (b) if
 we want instead to start the lunar pattern from the most northerly Di, then we must
 necessarily follow the Britton rule.

 Proof of (a). An Ai lunar eclipse falls 23.5 synodic months earlier or later than a Di

 solar eclipse. To see this, consider the Di solar eclipse at time 0. Then 4 solar EPs later,

 at time 24.0 sm, there will be another solar EP. There is a possibility of a lunar EP two

 weeks before this, at time 23.5 sm; for 23.5 smx (242 dm/223 sm) = 0.5022 dm, over

 and above complete draconic months, or very nearly 180° (actually about 180.79°).

 Therefore, the lunar EP would occur very nearly 180° from the initial solar Di, i.e.,

 with the mean Moon at nearly the same distance from the node, but south of the A

 node (rather than north of the D node). And this is an Ai—the most southerly lunar

 EP. But, of course, we could have instead chosen to place a lunar EP at time -23.5 sm.

 Thus, the lunar pattern follows the same 8-8-7-8-7- scheme as the solar pattern, but it
 starts 4 EP earlier or later.

 Proof of (b). The Britton rule implies that the first eclipse of the lunar 8-8-7-8-7

 pattern is 111.5 synodic months before the first (Di) solar eclipse of the solar 8-8-7

 8-7. Now, 111.5 sm are exactly 121 dm. Therefore, the Moon would be exactly at the

 same distance from the node. Consequently, it would be also the most northerly Di of

 the lunar eclipses. Because the Britton rule implies an interval of exactly half a Saros

 cycle (111.5 sm), it is the same to move forward or backward: Going the one way or

 the other, we will wind up at an eclipse belonging to the same Saros series. So, there
 is no alternative Britton rule.

 30 Appendix 7: Solar Saros series 50

 We can use the time of the opposition of month 1 (deduced from the lunar anomaly

 analysis) and the time of year of the same opposition (deduced from the solar anomaly

 analysis) for an alternative test of solar Saros 50 as a candidate. In Table 17, we list the

 dates and local times that would be possible for the opposition of month 1, assuming
 eclipse 13S belongs to solar Saros series 50. We have considered eclipses of series 50

 over four exeligmos periods, two before and one after our best exeligmos candidate.

 According to our analysis of the solar equation of center, the opposition of month 1
 should be between April 26 and May 27, but oppositions of month 1 for all cycles

 from —193 to +6 are between October and January. We would have to go back to

 -427 to find an opposition of month 1 on May 19 (but there the lunar mean anomaly

 would be around 256°) or go forward to year +150 to find an opposition of month 1

 on April 29. Also, the deduced time of day for the opposition of month 1 is between
 14:35 and 16:02, and there is no time in the table even close to those limits.
