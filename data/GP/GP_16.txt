Critics of the notion that fashion can be considered art are quick to point out that it cannot be considered an art form when it is simplistic and repetitive in design and intent. This is especially true of today's fast fashion industry, which, for the most part, merely churns out clothes and accessories that display minimal variety in design. These may not even be purposeful with respect to intent. Brands such as Forever 21 or H&M have long invited criticism for simply "following existing trends", catering to demands of consumers without innovating significantly or creating unique or distinctive designs. Given that a piece of work ought to show clear evidence of the creator's unique skills and intent in order to qualify as art, fast fashion brands usually fail to meet the criteria. This is perhaps due to the need for fast fashion to, after all, provide for consumer demand, rather than to be of any artistic value. Since consumers of fast fashion tend to look for clothes and accessories that are in trend, fashion brands reosrt to mass-producing garments that are less distinctive and more repetitive in their design, thus rendering fast fashion incapable of being considered art. 

However, this does not hold for all forms of fashion. Fashion can be considered art when it is effective in expressing clear artistic intent on the point of the designer and at times, the model wearing the design. One of the defining features of an artwork is when the artist's purpose of creation is conveyed to the viewer. This is vital as it helps the viewer understand the context of the art in order to better appreciate the aesthetic value in it. Therefore, fashion qualifies as art when such a purpose behind its creation is clearly evident. For instance, the Met Gala 2018 saw an extensive array of clothes and garments that celebrated its theme of religion. Among them was pop musician Rihanna's outfit which garnered applause from critics for being a "statement" piece, having been adapted from and heavily inspired by the robes of the Pope. Rihanna and her designer later clarified that her garments were meant to indicate that women were capable of assuming positions of power even in the area of religion. This is an example of how designs that are furnished with evidence of strong artistic expression are more likely to be perceived as art. Thus, when fashion designers and their models utilise their work as a platform to express creatively, fashion can be considered art.

Additionally, fashion can be categorised as art when it is used as an avenue by the designer to provide social commentary. Aayush Kejiriwal and Tarun Tahiliani, two south Asian designers, have drawn attention to their creations by hiring dark-skinned models as opposed to those with fairer complexions, although the latter has been viewed as a beauty standard in south Asian communities for centuries. By taking an active stand against colourism in the fashion industry and challenging the status quo with regards to conventional expectations of beauty, these designers are using the craft as a platform to raise awareness about ingrained mindsets in the south Asian community and to question societal norms. In doing so, fashion designers are enabling, to a large extent, fashion to be on par with other art forms that are used by artists to highlight social issues or problems. In this aspect, fashion can be considered art.
