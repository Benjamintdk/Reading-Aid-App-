﻿In addition, it is undeniable that governments have the resources and executive power to deal with conflicts arising from social inequalities. Especially in developed countries, where globalisation has brought about seemingly stratospheric economic progress, the increasing unhappiness of the people due to unequal social mobility and economic opportunities has become a pressing concern for governments. Coupled with the threat of global ‘Silver Tsunami’ due to increasing ageing population, governments are often hard-pressed for solutions to manage the conflicting needs of the people. Yet they are certainly far from powerless in coping with such conflicts, with the ability to allocate resources effectively, and providing opportunities for the vulnerable in society. This is evident in the welfare and subsidy schemes implemented by governments so as to give the poor in society a leg-up and allow them to attain a decent standard of living. For example, the Singapore government introduced heavily subsidised pre-schools run by the Ministry of Education so as to allow the lower-income families to send their children to pre-school without having to pay exorbitant fees. The Obamacare scheme in the US was also praised for its efforts to provide access to affordable healthcare to the poor and vulnerable in society. When the housing market gets overheated, the Singapore government readily steps in to cool housing prices to ensure that housing remains affordable. Such efforts on the part of governments have proven effective in alleviating the socioeconomic tensions within society, preventing unhappiness from brewing and fomenting discord among the people. By constantly keeping in touch with the citizens, and judiciously distributing resources according to the needs of the people, it is unlikely that governments are powerless to deal with the conflicts arising from inequality today.

Furthermore governments have the legislative power to influence and shape the psyche of their people, hence allowing them to manage the conflicts of today effectively. Besides implementing laws to curb incendiary behaviours, governments also have the soft power to nudge people into having greater civic-consciousness. The conflicts of today are the products of technological boom as well as rise in industrialism, ranging from online anti-social behaviours to environmental destruction. Across the range of conflicts, governments have shown the power to enforce social norms and protect social harmony through the implementation of laws. For example, the Singapore government’s move to criminalise cyber-bullying and hacking seeks to abolish online anti-social behaviours and to promote a safe and secure environment for web users. Conflicts arising from cyber-bullying are thus clamped down on harshly, eradicating such provocative and divisive events from repeating. Such laws aim to emphasise the government’s stand on certain issues that may destabilise or threaten the harmony of society, hence serving as a warning to potential offenders. The imposition of fines or even jail sentences on individuals or corporations who do not comply with acceptable standards, such as mistreating their workers or compromising the quality of their products which result in great unrest and unhappiness among the populace, are also measures to penalise and deter. Thus, the conflicts of today, while numerous, are still within the power of the governments, who have the legitimacy and right to enforce laws and ensure moral standards are upheld. 

Certainly, one must also consider the strength of the government when assessing its power to deal with the conflicts of today. To be able to deal with greater conflicts and concerns of the people, the government itself must be competent and efficient. The amount of power the government possesses largely depends on the effectiveness of the ruler as well as the institutions and other agencies put in place to ensure transparency, efficiency and incorruptibility. Thus it would be too sweeping a generalisation to comment on whether governments are powerless or not in dealing with the conflicts of today, as governance often encompasses the unique cultural and political context of the country, as well as the competency and the nature of its leader. Nonetheless, given the pressure of the international community, most governments have the power to deal with the conflicts of today. In conclusion, governments certainly wield power and control over most of the conflicts in today’s world. Though the nature of some of these conflicts may limit the amount of power governments have at times, the promise of international cooperation and collaboration effectively grant hope to governments all over the world in at least managing the effects of such conflicts.
