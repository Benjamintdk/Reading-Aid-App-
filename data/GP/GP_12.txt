The inexorable forces of globalisation have swept the global community. For better or for worse, the world is increasingly interconnected and integrated in terms of our economy, politics, and people. This has engendered a situation where one country’s internal affairs can easily create spill-over effects that will affect other countries. Furthermore, many countries have taken it upon themselves to intervene in other countries’ affairs, be it militarily, politically or via provision of foreign aid. A cursory examination of the issue may lead one to conclude that, indeed, foreign intervention may be desirable and hence justified as it provides salvation for a country confronted by difficult circumstances. However, lessons from the past and present have led me to take a more pessimistic view of the situation: I believe that foreign intervention in another country’s problems is largely unjustified, especially in view of how such “intervention” is carried out today – often with hegemonic, self-interested and regrettably vicious intentions. The only exception would be when countries truly attempt to intervene with altruistic motives, but such instances are few and far between. 

Before we overly condemn foreign intervention as utterly unjustified, I would first like to qualify that, to some extent, it can be warranted should intervention be based on moral and altruistic grounds. This view may seem highly idealistic taking into account the realpolitik nature of foreign policies practised by many countries, but such examples of noble intervention exist. For instance, in the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Nargis experienced by Myanmar, the country was thrown into turmoil as infrastructure was destroyed, large populations were displaced from their homes, and the government was plunged into a tumultuous state. As a symbol of goodwill, ASEAN nations took it upon themselves to intervene in the situation, sending aid and manpower to Myanmar to help ameliorate the crisis. Slowly but surely, the country began to get back on its feet, undoubtedly with the assistance of its neighbouring counterparts. What was interesting was that, following this, the Myanmese military junta was more open to hold talks with ASEAN leaders, and was also more willing to acquiesce to the demands of ASEAN. Arguably, this was a step in the right direction towards building bridges with a previously isolated country and helping to put Myanmar on the path towards free and democratic intervention.  Admittedly, when foreign intervention is carried out with goodwill and no hidden agenda whatsoever, then the aid provided will be channelled towards areas where the recipient country is truly deficient in and more likely be effective in remedying its problems. Furthermore, in a global context, such actions create mutual trust and goodwill between countries which is paramount in establishing regional stability. Therefore, in such a context of intervention being provided based on moral motivations, I would concede that foreign intervention is justified and, in fact, highly welcomed.

In the same vein, others may argue that foreign intervention is justified as it provides salvation to a country that is unable to help itself, and in so doing, prevents negative spill-over effects in the region. In certain situations, be it natural disasters or wars, weaker and poorer nations may be immobilised and weighed down, their governments unable to undertake the proper measures to alleviate the problems. For instance, during the Gulf War in the 1990s, when Saddam Hussein’s Iraq first invaded Kuwait and overran the country, the Kuwaitis were left shocked, helpless and oppressed. And with a weak military force, they could do nothing but wait helplessly for help from foreign neighbours. Threatened by Saddam’s expansionist agendas and afraid that they too would be targets of his aggression, Kuwait’s Middle-Eastern neighbours, with help from the US, decided to intervene, driving Iraqi forces back to its border and liberating Kuwait. Ostensibly, it seems that countries subject to unfortunate “black swan” events have no power whatsoever to defend themselves from incoming threats.
