“All mathematical statements mean the same thing, namely nothing,” is a famous quote uttered by the philosopher Wittgenstein. Both the quote alone and the question stem seem very provoking, since mathematics – one of the purest forms of knowledge – is just reduced to a mere game, one without any purpose or sense! If so, then why do we bother with math at all? Strange as it may seem, I agree that math is a game played (by us) according to certain rules (namely, those of deductive reasoning), but I do not agree that Math is meaningless. Meaning is a quality endowed on something by us humans, and in this scenario we ought to consider the meaning of math via the reliability of the knowledge it generates and the utility of these claims in other fields. By both accounts, math is not meaningless. Where did math come from? When did it begin? These are not questions that come to one’s mind immediately upon thinking of this essay’s question stem, but I believe that they play a crucial role in answering the question. 

Statements like 1+1=2 are undoubtedly mathematical in nature, yet we have good evidence that human babies and even most animals have some comprehension of such mathematical statements related to primitive arithmetic. Do these living beings play this “game” of math too? Seemingly not, for our concept of a game is one of something that is created just for fun. It has been argued that the very act of separating objects into numerical, countable sets leads to benefits for all animals (e.g. identifying how many predators are chasing you). Primitive and contrite as all this might seem – it does give us an inkling of the applicability of math in the real world, and the idea that mathematics might have a deep neurological grounding in our brains. In that sense, at least, it would not seem to be merely a game. Yet I do believe ultimately that mathematics is just a game. Why? For this, one must consider the growth of mathematics and the kinds of knowledge that are generated. Starting with primitive arithmetic, the Greeks stumbled upon irrational numbers and ultimately, in the last few hundred years, mathematicians have come up with the idea of imaginary numbers. What on Earth is an imaginary number? I can count 5 apples, I can even visualise π to be the ratio of a circle’s circumference and diameter. All that math seems to have meaning – a kind of truth that corresponds to what we can see in the world. But does √(-1) apply? Such a concept seems perplexing, at best. Yet, millions of students worldwide accept that the idea of imaginary numbers exists, and that it does make logical sense. According to a correspondent truth, √(-1) cannot be directly observed, and so it is meaningless in that it does not seem to be able to be true. Yet this betrays a deep assumption, that math needs to directly apply to the real world. As long as we relax the idea that any mathematical object ought to have a real-life counterpart, we can progress with math. The cost though, is this – math develops into a game, one whose ideas are rational and deductively follow from one another.	

Obviously, some philosophers have problems with this, but unfortunately for them, that is just how math is. Multi-dimensional spaces, sets of numbers smaller than every real number – these things are quite literally out of our world. Yet, there is a problem. If mathematics is just a game we play according to deductive logic, then what do we base our deductions on? After al, to deduce anything, you require something to deduce it from. According to modern mathematics, this deduction is done on the basis of certain basic axioms. For example, all of Euclidean geometry can be deduced from 5 postulates. These postulates seem to be self-evident and really, cannot be justified on the basis of anything else. Yet are they true? It is hard to give an explanation of why they ought to be true – and indeed they do not need to be true! Rejecting the parallel postulate is how the wonderful field of spherical and hyperbolic geometry was born.
