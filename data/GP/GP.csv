"In today 's changing world, the increasingly freest movement of people across the borders has changed demographic dynamic in many countries. Public diplomacy can bring in capital, expertise and foreign skills to bolster the country's skills needs with human capital for increased economic growth. Furthermore, there was therefore a responsibility for the government to prioritise protecting the environment that all locals work in above the invasion by external foreigners and enhance sustainability for future generations. ","In today's globalised world, the increasingly freer movement of people across national boundaries has changed the demographics of many countries. People arrive on the shores of foreign countries in search of better economic opportunities, tourism or even to seek asylum as they face political persecution in their home country. These increased movement of people across national boundaries has added on to the challenges that a government must face and tackle. It is thus pertinent to place the environmental and economic interests, and social welfare of the locals above foreigners as the former are the ones who remain rooted in their country of origin as they weather through the good and bad times. However, the government also has to spare some consideration and sacrifice the interests of locals to some extent to fulfil their moral obligations of providing humanitarian assistance to foreigners fleeing political persecution. 
Economic migration can bring in capital, knowledge and foreign technology to bolster a country's capital stock and human capital for increased economic growth. However, a government is obliged to remain committed in protecting the economic interests of the locals to ensure employment and their continued stake in the economy. Foreigners who are economic migrants seek out better employment and a higher standard of living in countries overseas. While these foreigners, such as Bangladeshi and Chinese workers, help to plug manpower shortages in sectors such as construction in countries with small population sizes such as Singapore, the government needs to ensure that the locals continue to have access to employment. The government, being representative of its own citizens, has the obligation to protect their monetary interests in the economic arena. The government has to ensure that the influx of foreigners is carefully controlled and are only allowed into sectors of the economy that are facing manpower shortages as employment opportunities that are not taken up by locals. An example would be the construction and gardening industries in Singapore, which are mostly shunned by locals. However, in white-collared professions in biomedical fields and healthcare, the influx of foreign talent from countries such as India needs to be managed. This ensures that local graduates will still be able to find employment. 
Furthermore, there is also a need for the government to prioritise protecting the environment that the locals live in above the needs of the foreigners to ensure sustainability for future generations. Foreigners entering a foreign land to travel or to seek out economic opportunities are a transient group that do not have a vested commitment in their country of visit. However, for locals, the country they are in is their home and the resources in the country are finite. To ensure sustainability of the environment's resources to address the future needs and generations of the locals, it is important that a government protects the environment the locals live in. For example, coastal cities and islands in Spain live off visitors into small towns and cities have led to a multitude of social and environmental problems.  The increase in tourists has led to an increase in private hire and rental transport, and illegal parking has become an eyesore, prompting the local administration to ban parking at cathedrals and city squares. Ironically, this has brought a significant degree of disruption for locals, who have to park further away or circle around for extended periods of time to find a parking space. The influx of foreigners has also placed strains on finite natural resources such as water. Thus, there is rising unhappiness amongst the Spanish due to the gradual degradation of the environment they live in, as there is not enough being done by the government to manage their needs by controlling the influx of foreigners.

" Even though our modern world hasn seen few major skirmishes on the level of any cold wars, what about in our ever-divided environment today. It has also been said that governments have in fact become exceptionally powerful with respect to dealing with our disagreements or skirm ishes, as they often boast the ability to band together to solve their problems and even direct the power commanding many states to a conflict in a country. Conflicts such as inter-racial violence experienced between black and radical Christian supremacist groups has experienced a spike after a lull since the late 2000, while the growing poor divide has led to tensions between the so-called ""1 %"" and the more working-class populations all over the world, erupting into the worldwide ""Occupy "" movement that remains strong today, even after almost exactly a decade. ","Even though the modern era has seen fewer major skirmishes on the level of the world wars, conflicts about in our ever-divisive environment today. As the world becomes more globalised, disagreements have emerged through the fault lines of our society, pitting races against each other, as is the case in Myanmar, with the majority Burmese community turning on the Rohingyas. This has exposed fundamental differences between ideologies and beliefs that threaten to descend into bedlam, such as the left-right slit that has risen to prominence in the United States. Indeed, it can be seen that governments today are mostly helpless in dealing with our fundamental differences, and have no means of addressing society's disagreements and conflicts. Our leaders and bureaucracies are remnants of a past time, and no longer have the ability to adapt to the rapidly-changing environment of today's world. Unless governments can break out of their current, rigid structures and emerge with a new place in the people's psyche, governments will remain helpless in the face of our modern disagreements. It must, first and foremost, be conceded that the government remains one of the most powerful institutions on this planet. The government of a country is essentially the puppet-master behind the workings of the state, as most leaders can bend national activity and opinion to their will. The United States federal government, for instance, has relatively limited powers compared to institutions such as the state assemblies which govern individual states, but it is still able to harness the full might and will of the American people to destructive effect, as demonstrated in its repeated annihilation of its enemies in World Wars I and II. The military-industrial complex has been a key tool in major governments' toolboxes, one which has the power to end military conflicts once and for all. In more recent terms, this has emerged in the United States' manipulation of global events ""ì it was able to stop the Israelis' offensive in the Arab-Israeli War of 1971, and could respond to the Iraqis' invasion of Kuwait with devastating effect. Evidently, governments have an overbearing capacity to harness the resources of a nation towards a common cause, one of which has been the resolution of armed conflict around the world. 
It has also been said that governments have in fact become more powerful with respect to dealing with our disagreements and skirmishes, as countries now have the ability to band together to solve international problems or to direct the power of many states towards a conflict in a country. The United Nations, comprising governments from all over the world, has used peacekeeping forces to maintain order and restore peace in conflict-ridden regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, on the other hand, a regional intergovernmental body, has helped mediate international disagreements in the South China Sea. By uniting around a common cause, governments have a force multiplier that maximises their power in dealing with today's unique transnational problems. With the full weight of international support, governments have become ever more able in resolving or ameliorating the effects of our modern conflicts. Thus, it seems as though governments have developed new, effective tools to address our current issues. However, such a view is overly optimistic, as governments in fact have no means of addressing current conflicts in an adequate manner. Today's conflicts do not solely exist in the national realm; there are conflicts brewing in our fundamental social fabric as well. 
Conflicts such as inter-racial violence experienced between black and radical white supremacist groups have experienced a resurgence after a lull in the late 20th century, while the rich poor divide has led to tensions between the so-called ""1%""ù and the remaining working-class populations all over the world, erupting into the worldwide ""Occupy""ù movement that remains strong today, even after almost half a decade. These conflicts strike at the very heart of society, and they arise due to a multitude of reasons that governments have no means of tackling in full: changing demographics, as can be seen in the United States, where for the first time in its history there were more ""minority""ù newborns than white ones; changing societal norms, brought about by the use of the internet, which has allowed fringe groups to band together and exert a collective influence on society's direction; and changing economic conditions, with automation and technology robbing many blue-collar workers of their livelihoods and exacerbating the already-intractable problem of inequality. The government has little control over these changes, for they lie outside its conventional interests of national security, economic growth and self-preservation. In effect, governments today lie in a paradigm of their own, increasingly disconnected from the events their constituents experience. Great Britain, for instance, has found itself caught unawares by the Brexit vote, with well-heeled members of the elite (most notably on Downing Street) predicting a solid Remain victory even on the night of the referendum, deluded by the pleasant illusion that the people were not troubled by the events in Europe. Clearly, governments have been unprepared for such ground-breaking developments, causing them to be utterly ill-equipped to deal with the conflicts that matter today. In particular, governments have found themselves flailing at the sight of core social issues, for they are unexpected beasts which cannot be tamed by financial instruments nor the state's military apparatus.

"Despite increasing inter-connections in the shrinking global economy the region today is grappling with conflicts that extend beyond a country's borders, characterised by the unnerving atmosphere of uncertainty or volatility. Small nations often seem to be powerless in the face of conflicts which can be controlled within their territorial borders, and ideological wars that plant seeds to discord within and beyond a country. So while it is probably in their power to settle ideological conflicts within their borders, military power of international and inter governmental efforts has much greater promise and opportunities.","With increasing interconnectivity in a shrinking global village, the world today is fraught with conflicts that extend beyond a country's borders, characterised by an unnerving sense of uncertainty and volatility. With the threat of religious fundamentalism, growing social inequality in the aftermath of rapid globalisation and international disputes abounding across the globe, it appears as though governments are increasingly losing influence and power in managing the conflicts of today. This is perhaps evident in the growing unhappiness of civilians with their incumbent rulers, leading to a spate of protests and even uprisings in extreme cases. However, to say that governments are powerless to deal with the conflicts of today would be to be too nihilistic a view, and suggests that people or other organisations instead should be held accountable to deal with the conflicts of today. Certainly, while conflicts may seem to overheat at times, it is undeniable that governments possess the resources, influence and legitimacy to tackle the problems of today. Hence, although some conflicts may be beyond the reach of governments, most are still within the power of the governments to manage and control. 
Indeed, governments may seem to be powerless in the face of conflicts that cannot be controlled within their own borders, particularly ideological threats that plant seeds of discord within and beyond the country. The rise of religious extremism and the encroaching threat of terrorism in countries all over the world are testament to the transnational nature of conflicts today. Such threats can hardly be confined to a particular group or nation, and the very fact that it is faceless makes it almost impossible for governments to tackle the problem. The rise of ISIS, for example, was completely unanticipated, where the Islamic militia swept through Syria and captured great swathes of land within hours. In addition, the media and propaganda branch of ISIS simultaneously began a hashtag movement #AlleyesonISIS, featuring atrocities committed by the jihadist fighters so as to instil fear and a sense of inevitability among the people. Certainly, ISIS's effective use of social media platform to recruit potential jihadists from all around the world and to spread the utopian vision of an Islamic caliphate has rendered governments powerless in controlling the spread of terrorism. Despite increased security measures being implemented, the unpredictable nature of terrorist and lone wolf attacks often make such efforts ineffective or even futile. In the face of religious zeal and fervour, governments are unable to wield decisive and conclusive power for fear the proactive measures may add fuel to the fire, leading to more atrocities and resulting in a stronger backlash. Thus, in the face of borderless and ideological conflicts, governments may seem to be powerless in controlling the spread of extremism and in effectively protecting their citizens.
However, while governments are limited in their power to curb ideological conflicts within their borders, the power of international and intergovernmental efforts holds much more promise and potential. The formation of international peacekeeping organisations such as the United Nations (UN) offers the possibility of tackling the threat of terrorism on a war footing, with the expertise and cooperation of nations all around the world. The UN Security Council recently announced a unanimous agreement by all its nations to eliminate terrorism, giving hope to many who have suffered the atrocities of extremist groups. The US, Russia and several countries have joined arms in conducting air raids and drone strikes in the Middle East, destroying vast swathes if terrorist territory as well as their oil source from which they fund their attacks and the organisation itself. The interconnected nature of surveillance technologies across the globe has allowed governments to track movements of potential terrorists, and even predict their attacks using highly sophisticated software so as to prevent them from happening. The sharing of resources and information between governments has granted them power to eradicate threats and nip them in the bud before any harm can be inflicted. The communication and ties between countries help to build rapport and support, providing aid and reinforcements to weaker countries when required. Thus, it is evident that despite the fact that individual governments may be powerless to control such a far-reaching and uncontrollable conflict, the cooperation and unity of governments across the world accrues great power and influence in tackling such problems.

"But there was no credit for the argument the governments bear moral responsibilities to provide voluntary assistance to foreigners fleeing political instability within their home countries. This being stated the social welfare of locals needs to be addressed and placed over the needs for citizens who were expatriates or simply tourists. By conclusion, a government must continuously place the needs of the citizens above the needs of foreigners. ","However, there is also credit to the argument that governments have moral responsibilities to provide humanitarian assistance to foreigners fleeing political persecution in their home countries. As such, the needs of the foreigners are sometimes being placed above the needs of the locals. For example, Syrian refugees fleeing the ongoing political crisis in Syria are seeking refuge in the European continent. There is a moral obligation for European governments to provide sufficient humanitarian assistance to these refugees seeking asylum as deporting them could potentially result in deaths. By closing off their borders to these refugees, the refugees are forced to find pathways to other countries, making the journey in overcrowded flimsy boats that often capsize in choppy seas. As of date, more than 3700 migrants have drowned in capsizing incidents. Some may argue that by accepting these refugees, a considerable amount of strain is placed upon the social welfare system of host countries, who now have to provide food, accommodation and other needs of these foreigners. This may be unfair for locals, who are paying taxes to support such systems. The increasing discontent towards the migrants has manifested in European-wide movements campaigning against accepting the refugees. To mitigate social unrest, governments need to work together to ensure proportional distribution of the incoming refugees. 
That being said, the social welfare of locals needs to be addressed and prioritised over the needs of foreigners who are expatriates or economic migrants. As countries have finite resources, a government has to prioritise the needs of locals over that of foreigners. For example, in Singapore, locals receive extensive healthcare subsidies in the form of Medisave and other related schemes that provide subsidised hospital stays. This ensures that in view of rising demand for our first-class healthcare services from around the world, healthcare remains affordable and accessible for locals in Singapore. Furthermore, priority is given to local born children to enrol in heavily subsidized government schools to ensure that local children are able to attend school at affordable rates, despite the increase in expatriate families. This is due to limited spaces in our local schools, and to ensure that locals are still able to have a space, priority is given to locals through staggered enrolment schemes for primary one enrolment. If these welfare measures are not put in place by the government, such services may no longer be affordable or accessible to locals as the latter may not be able to pay the premium prices that foreigners are willing to pay for the high quality of healthcare and education that the country is able to offer. Hence, to prevent locals from being priced out of social welfare services by wealthier incoming foreigners, the government needs to protect the welfare needs of the locals and prioritise such interests over that of foreigners. 
In conclusion, the government should continuously place the needs of locals above the needs of foreigners. This is because locals remain invested and committed to the country, and will weather through the ups and downs a country faces. The environment they live in must be sustainable and continue to be so for future generations. The economic needs and social welfare interests of locals have to be addressed adequately to ensure that locals are not disadvantaged by the influx of foreigners. At the same time, governments may sometimes have to sacrifice the welfare of locals to fulfil a moral obligation to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees who would otherwise face political persecutions back home. As such, governments need to carefully weigh their policy decisions, and continue to prioritise the needs of locals as much as they can. Locals have a part to play by being open to integrating foreigners who are staying on for the longer term into their communities and be more open-minded in accepting differences. International cooperation is also important in ensuring that the responsibility for global crises such as the Middle East refugee crisis do not fall upon one or a small group of countries who may be overwhelmed by the influx. Larger and richer countries would then need to step up to fulfill their global and moral responsbilities to shoulder the burden.

"We often define good leadership as one that can see after the welfare of its people by addressing their needs and frame domestic policy by terms of a political, social or economic agenda. A democratically elected executive bears the moral obligation to account for the needs of its own people above others as this enhances their welfare and contentions as citizens of the nation, thereby allowing for continual development when its electorate remains supportive of its government and policies. The influx of refugees into numerous rural areas also suffered considerable adverse impacts on the locals, such as increased tax burdens to accommodate the larger population.","People often define good leadership as one that can look after the welfare of its people by meeting their needs and maintaining domestic security in terms of the political, social and economic aspects. It is argued that a strong and popular government always places its domestic needs and welfare above all else, thereby negating the need to take into account the impact on foreigners on a global scale. To a large extent, I feel that a democratic government should consider the needs of its electorate before others since the government has the moral obligation to answer to its population after being elected. By responding to the problems of the masses and shaping policies that are solely aimed at improving the country's welfare, it ensures long term progress since the people, who make up the country, are contented. Therefore, if a government is unable to satisfy its population, and instead, sacrifices the welfare of its people in exchange for foreign or global approval, it may be met with domestic resistance and lose its political mandate. However, it is fallacious to have the view that the needs of locals should always be the top priority of the government as it may compromise on the greater good, culminating in adverse side effects for countries. Furthermore, in countries which have a diverse population and a reliance on foreign talent to contribute to the nation, the government should not compromise the needs of foreigners just to appease the locals as this would lead to a stratified society and even jeopardise the development of the nation. 
A democratically elected government has the moral responsibility to account for the needs of its own people above others as this ensures their welfare and contentment as citizens of the nation, thereby allowing for continual progress when the electorate is supportive of its government's policies. As political leaders are voted into power because of the hope and trust invested in them by the population, it is important that the government fulfils its political promises and considers the needs and development of the people to ensure that there is sustained progress and prosperity within a nation. Governments should be discerning in placing the welfare of its people as top priority, as the inability to satisfy their demands will engender discontent and political opposition. A prime example of how a government have placed the needs of locals before foreigners would be the 2015 European Union (EU) migrant crisis. In the light of the instability and violence within the state of Syria, where the bellicose terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iran and Syria (ISIS) has been battling with the belligerent leader Bashar al-Assad for control over the land, the constant bloodshed and aggression have gravely compromised the welfare of its civilians. This has driven numerous desperate Syrian families to seek refuge and political asylum in its neighbouring EU countries to escape the civil war within their nation. 
The influx of foreigners in numerous EU countries has had considerable social impacts on the locals, such as increased financial burdens to accommodate the larger population. As a result, there was a public outcry and pressure for politicians to limit the influx of migrants and reject the refugees at the countries' borders, Hence, countries such as Hungary shifted their stances to reduce and even stop the inflow of migrants to satisfy its domestic population, effectively lightening their economic burden and containing the negative social impacts brought about by overcrowding. This shows the importance of taking into account the needs of the country and its people, as government policies invariably affect the lives of the people, thus the government should prioritise the needs of the locals in order to ensure domestic stability and continual progress to be made for the country. If helping the refugees comes at the expense of the people's contentment and compromises their standard of living, it would only be natural for the locals to protest against the government's actions, Thus, the government should place the needs of locals before foreigners.

"But the position that a government should always put its own needs above others is not justified if its behaviour draws serious consequences on the international scale. On the other hand, if a state merely seeks the welfare of other nations at the expense regarding its own domestic needs, it can translate to the loss thereof their support and their legitimacy within the nation. On the contrary, when a government prioritises the needs of its people before foreigners, such policies would threaten political stability and diplomatic relationships with other countries, thereby causing economic harm for its people and reducing growth prospects. ","However, the claim that the government should always value its domestic needs above others is not justified if its action has serious repercussions on the global scale. If a country ignores the impact of their policies on third parties such as neighbouring countries, it could infringe on the sovereignty and national interests of other nations and compromise the greater good. A notable example would be the burning of lands by Indonesian farmers, which had a detrimental environmental impact on its Southeast Asian neighbours. Due to the economic benefits reaped by local farmers through deforestation and the burning of fields, the Indonesian government has been largely indifferent to the repercussions on its neighbouring countries such as Malaysia and Singapore.  This annual affair has caused large amounts of smoke and haze to be carried across its borders, causing spill-over effects that are deleterious to other countries. The hazardous level of smoke particles have led to a deterioration of health amongst citizens of Singapore and Malaysia, and even a significant drop in the tourism sector. 
On the other hand, if a nation merely considers the welfare of other nations at the expense of their own domestic needs, it may lead to the loss of political support and their legitimacy over the nation. A prime example is Taiwan, in which the previous leader Ma Ying-Jeou was unable to meet the demands of his people and be in line with their vision to fight for an independent Taiwan apart from China. His inability to connect with the masses as seen from his overtly friendly relationships with mainland China, incited domestic outrage over jeopardising Taiwan's welfare in exchange for personal economic interests. As a result, popular support for him plummeted, leading to the loss of his party in the 2016 elections, allowing for the landslide victory of Tsai Ing-wen who was able to ally with the masses and answer their fears and concerns. This shows that a politician has to share similar political aspirations with his people in order to trust and support, or else he would risk his legitimacy to rule, culminating in growing opposition, eventually ending his political stint. Thus, it is necessary for governments to place the needs of its people before of foreigners. 
On the contrary, if a government prioritises the needs of its locals before foreigners, its policies may threaten political ties and diplomatic relationships with other countries, eventually causing more harm to its people and worsening their prospects. This can be seen in the nuclear power accumulation by lran, which successfully tested its nuclear programme to safeguard its sovereignty and political interests. Such a move is an act of deterrence in a world with volatile and unpredictable geopolitics, especially seen in the annexation of Crimea by belligerent Russia in 2014. This raised global alarm and invited intervention in countries such as the US and UK, viewing Iran's action as a hostile one which could jeopardise global peace and security. As a result, it strained relationships between Iran and its trading partners, such that they imposed sanctions and embargoes to contain Iran's expanding nuclear capabilities. This shows that governments which prioritise the needs of their people and country are myopic if they fail to take into account the global repercussions. If their actions compromise the welfare of others, it would lead to the breakdown of diplomatic ties and could worsen a country's welfare. Therefore, in situations where the actions of a government could threaten the sovereignty of others, prioritising its people first may not be justified and may even lead to counteractive outcomes.

"In the conflicts of much more often, particularly in the realm of violent conflict, and the government has found itself to be even more inept at working alongside its shapeshifted enemy. In fact, it could be said that it is precisely the great powers these governments wield which make them powerless to asymmetric forces: by being too heavy-handed in their handling of such conflicts, governments exacerbate the problem by inspiring Islamist rebels and inciting further tensions in Syria. In conclusion, governments are shown to be helpless at dealing with our global conflicts, and for good reasons; they are sorely unprepared to deal with the force that our world requires.","Furthermore, the conflicts of today are often asymmetrical, particularly in the realm of violent conflict, and the government has found itself to be even more inept at dealing with the shapeshifting enemy. The perpetrators of deadly conflict and the people who stoke racial or socioeconomic tensions behind a wall of anonymity are unseen culprits, and dealing with these armed conflicts or disputes in the socioeconomic realm requires governments to deal with the root cause behind them. Yet it appears that governments do not know how; Boko Haram has been going on bloody rampages in Nigeria, yet the Nigerian government helmed by a former military leader is still attempting to deal with the social and political fallout from the abduction of the Chibok girls almost three years ago. ISIS thrived on a groundswell of local support, and terrorised the West2 until it decided to establish itself as a state with territories that could be conquered with conventional military forces. This provides for a damning assessment of government power, for even the most powerful governments in the world, united in spirit, have been unable to defeat a tiny, but shrewd, enemy. 
In fact, it can be said that it is precisely the overwhelming might these governments wield that make them powerless to asymmetric conflict ""ì by being too heavy-handed in their resolution of such conflicts, governments worsen the problem by inspiring more rebels and inciting further tensions in society. Governments do not understand the conflicts they are dealing with, which renders them helpless even with the might of a state's resources behind them. Ultimately, governments are often powerless to deal with the conflicts of today because the governments themselves are the root cause of these conflicts. For instance, dissent in Hong Kong and conflict between Hong Kongers and mainlanders was born out of the ineptitude of the Hong Kong Chief Executive, and there is little the government can do to quell the tensions but to hope for the best. In other words, the xenophobia and hatred that created current social conflicts were purposefully cultivated for the governments' own political means, just that these social developments got out of hand. In Myanmar, for instance, much of the violence on the Rohingyas is sanctioned by the majority Buddhist government, inspiring monks such as the ""òBurmese bin Laden' to turn on their own fellow countrymen. Now that the conflict between the stateless Rohingyas and the Burmese has gone past the tipping point, there is little that the junta could or the government can do to resolve these tensions in society. The governments that perpetrated these conflicts cannot stop these negative social developments without appearing hypocritical, and even if they do attempt to quell these enmities in a bid to deal with the conflict they lose their trustworthiness in the eyes of the people, and in effect lose their ability to act even if they have the humane will to do so. The government is thus stuck in a Catch-22 situation, rendering national leaders helpless and leaving them to the mercy of the public. Addressing the social developments or tensions behind national or cross-border conflict is essential in dealing with the conflicts today, but when the government has been a direct cause of the conflict, inadvertently or purposefully, there is nothing it can do to relieve the conflict and stop the madness. 
In conclusion, governments are increasingly appearing to be helpless at dealing with our current conflicts, and with good reason ""ì they are sorely ill-equipped to deal with the conflicts that our world faces today. Indeed there is little any one body or organisation can do to deal with our conflicts ""ì even the national peace quartet from Tunisia that won the Nobel Peace Prize could only maintain the harmony for so long ""ì and the best we can do at this point in time is to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Our world today is a messy one, giving rise to the most chaotic conflicts in human memory; our governments need to begin the long, arduous, and painful transition if they wish to have some semblance of control and a modicum of power in addressing the conflicts of our modern world.

"In America it is clear few governments have the resources or the power that deal with conflicts arising from social inequalities. Furthermore governments enjoy considerable legislative potential to influence or shape the psyche of their citizens thus enabling them to manage the conflicts of interests effectively. Certainly, government does also consider the strength that the government when assessing its power to deal with the unprecedented challenges of today. ","In addition, it is undeniable that governments have the resources and executive power to deal with conflicts arising from social inequalities. Especially in developed countries, where globalisation has brought about seemingly stratospheric economic progress, the increasing unhappiness of the people due to unequal social mobility and economic opportunities has become a pressing concern for governments. Coupled with the threat of global ""òSilver Tsunami' due to increasing ageing population, governments are often hard-pressed for solutions to manage the conflicting needs of the people. Yet they are certainly far from powerless in coping with such conflicts, with the ability to allocate resources effectively, and providing opportunities for the vulnerable in society. This is evident in the welfare and subsidy schemes implemented by governments so as to give the poor in society a leg-up and allow them to attain a decent standard of living. For example, the Singapore government introduced heavily subsidised pre-schools run by the Ministry of Education so as to allow the lower-income families to send their children to pre-school without having to pay exorbitant fees. The Obamacare scheme in the US was also praised for its efforts to provide access to affordable healthcare to the poor and vulnerable in society. When the housing market gets overheated, the Singapore government readily steps in to cool housing prices to ensure that housing remains affordable. Such efforts on the part of governments have proven effective in alleviating the socioeconomic tensions within society, preventing unhappiness from brewing and fomenting discord among the people. By constantly keeping in touch with the citizens, and judiciously distributing resources according to the needs of the people, it is unlikely that governments are powerless to deal with the conflicts arising from inequality today.
Furthermore governments have the legislative power to influence and shape the psyche of their people, hence allowing them to manage the conflicts of today effectively. Besides implementing laws to curb incendiary behaviours, governments also have the soft power to nudge people into having greater civic-consciousness. The conflicts of today are the products of technological boom as well as rise in industrialism, ranging from online anti-social behaviours to environmental destruction. Across the range of conflicts, governments have shown the power to enforce social norms and protect social harmony through the implementation of laws. For example, the Singapore government's move to criminalise cyber-bullying and hacking seeks to abolish online anti-social behaviours and to promote a safe and secure environment for web users. Conflicts arising from cyber-bullying are thus clamped down on harshly, eradicating such provocative and divisive events from repeating. Such laws aim to emphasise the government's stand on certain issues that may destabilise or threaten the harmony of society, hence serving as a warning to potential offenders. The imposition of fines or even jail sentences on individuals or corporations who do not comply with acceptable standards, such as mistreating their workers or compromising the quality of their products which result in great unrest and unhappiness among the populace, are also measures to penalise and deter. Thus, the conflicts of today, while numerous, are still within the power of the governments, who have the legitimacy and right to enforce laws and ensure moral standards are upheld. 
Certainly, one must also consider the strength of the government when assessing its power to deal with the conflicts of today. To be able to deal with greater conflicts and concerns of the people, the government itself must be competent and efficient. The amount of power the government possesses largely depends on the effectiveness of the ruler as well as the institutions and other agencies put in place to ensure transparency, efficiency and incorruptibility. Thus it would be too sweeping a generalisation to comment on whether governments are powerless or not in dealing with the conflicts of today, as governance often encompasses the unique cultural and political context of the country, as well as the competency and the nature of its leader. Nonetheless, given the pressure of the international community, most governments have the power to deal with the conflicts of today. In conclusion, governments certainly wield power and control over most of the conflicts in today's world. Though the nature of some of these conflicts may limit the amount of power governments have at times, the promise of international cooperation and collaboration effectively grant hope to governments all over the world in at least managing the effects of such conflicts.

"Both mathematical expressions mean the same, and this is a famous observation made by the philosopher Wittgen. Statements like 1 + 1 = 1 are largely ubiquitous by nature, although we have good evidence that human babies and even most animals have little use of such mathematical statements related to basic arithmetic. Obviously, many people have fun with this, but unfortunately for me that is just what it is. ","""All mathematical statements mean the same thing, namely nothing,""ù is a famous quote uttered by the philosopher Wittgenstein. Both the quote alone and the question stem seem very provoking, since mathematics ""ì one of the purest forms of knowledge ""ì is just reduced to a mere game, one without any purpose or sense! If so, then why do we bother with math at all? Strange as it may seem, I agree that math is a game played (by us) according to certain rules (namely, those of deductive reasoning), but I do not agree that Math is meaningless. Meaning is a quality endowed on something by us humans, and in this scenario we ought to consider the meaning of math via the reliability of the knowledge it generates and the utility of these claims in other fields. By both accounts, math is not meaningless. Where did math come from? When did it begin? These are not questions that come to one's mind immediately upon thinking of this essay's question stem, but I believe that they play a crucial role in answering the question. 
Statements like 1+1=2 are undoubtedly mathematical in nature, yet we have good evidence that human babies and even most animals have some comprehension of such mathematical statements related to primitive arithmetic. Do these living beings play this ""game""ù of math too? Seemingly not, for our concept of a game is one of something that is created just for fun. It has been argued that the very act of separating objects into numerical, countable sets leads to benefits for all animals (e.g. identifying how many predators are chasing you). Primitive and contrite as all this might seem ""ì it does give us an inkling of the applicability of math in the real world, and the idea that mathematics might have a deep neurological grounding in our brains. In that sense, at least, it would not seem to be merely a game. Yet I do believe ultimately that mathematics is just a game. Why? For this, one must consider the growth of mathematics and the kinds of knowledge that are generated. Starting with primitive arithmetic, the Greeks stumbled upon irrational numbers and ultimately, in the last few hundred years, mathematicians have come up with the idea of imaginary numbers. What on Earth is an imaginary number? I can count 5 apples, I can even visualise œÄ to be the ratio of a circle's circumference and diameter. All that math seems to have meaning ""ì a kind of truth that corresponds to what we can see in the world. But does ‚àö(-1) apply? Such a concept seems perplexing, at best. Yet, millions of students worldwide accept that the idea of imaginary numbers exists, and that it does make logical sense. According to a correspondent truth, ‚àö(-1) cannot be directly observed, and so it is meaningless in that it does not seem to be able to be true. Yet this betrays a deep assumption, that math needs to directly apply to the real world. As long as we relax the idea that any mathematical object ought to have a real-life counterpart, we can progress with math. The cost though, is this ""ì math develops into a game, one whose ideas are rational and deductively follow from one another.	
Obviously, some philosophers have problems with this, but unfortunately for them, that is just how math is. Multi-dimensional spaces, sets of numbers smaller than every real number ""ì these things are quite literally out of our world. Yet, there is a problem. If mathematics is just a game we play according to deductive logic, then what do we base our deductions on? After al, to deduce anything, you require something to deduce it from. According to modern mathematics, this deduction is done on the basis of certain basic axioms. For example, all of Euclidean geometry can be deduced from 5 postulates. These postulates seem to be self-evident and really, cannot be justified on the basis of anything else. Yet are they true? It is hard to give an explanation of why they ought to be true ""ì and indeed they do not need to be true! Rejecting the parallel postulate is how the wonderful field of spherical and hyperbolic geometry was born.

"Peer review has ever since held up as the gold standard in determining the quality for any scholarly research publication. Now, it's already well-known fact that, aside from its use across academic journals, peer selection defines the process through which grants are allocated, scientists are promoted, textbooks are written, and Nobel Letters get won. The fact there are no agreed-upon, evidence-based guidelines as to what is considered a qualified paper.","Peer review has long been held to be the gold standard in determining the quality of any scholarly journal publication. Scientific journals catalogue the contributions, thoughts, and opinions of researchers, investigators, and experts in the field, and the prestige of a journal depends on the validity, usefulness, and quality of the articles published. The peer review process is essentially a quality control mechanism as it subjects research papers to independent scrutiny by other (anonymous) qualified experts before the journal editormakes a final publication decision. Theoretically, peer review should help authors make their manuscript better. But in reality, the cutthroat attitude that pervades the system results in ludicrous rejections for personal reasons""îif the reviewer feels that the paper threatens his or her own research or contradicts his or her beliefs, for example""îor simply for convenience, since top journals get too many submissions and it's easier to just reject a paper than spend the time to improve it. Reviewers are also more likely to favour manuscripts that are clearly written, are creative, demonstrate positive results, and have interesting titles, and may more readily accept manuscripts from more prestigious institutions than those from lesser-known institutions.
Now, it is a well-known fact that, aside from its use in scientific journals, peer review is the process by which grants are allocated, academics are promoted, textbooks are written, and Nobel prizes are won. A publication that has been peer reviewed gains respectability and acceptance and is considered a relevant contribution to the field; peer review is a professional privilege and responsibility that directly impacts what is accepted as important to a body of knowledge. This is very important in Science, since nothing can be considered true unless verified by the scientific community. The certainty of Science rests largely on how well new theories and ideas fit in with the rest of the field. But if peer reviews aren't as credible a process as is often believed to be, we wouldn't know if what is published is really true! Perhaps anonymous peer review should be abolished, because reviewers are biased by personal motives. Anonymity gives the reviewer latitude to say all sorts of nasty things, and allows for the infiltration of inevitable personal biases""îagainst the scientific ideas presented or even the authors themselves""îinto a judgment that should be based entirely on scientific merit.
In addition, there are no agreed-upon, evidence-based guidelines as to what constitutes a qualified reviewer. Journal editors simply pick and choose whoever they think is suitable.This arbitrariness in what has been called the gold-standard for evaluating and selecting disturbing, especially since we continually hail the value-free, coherence in being able to explain the world we live in. We also wouldn't know if journal editors are accepting or rejecting publications based on what is currently trending or what they want people to read so as to boost article sales and publication profit. Back in the day when data for music hits were compiled based on verbal reports by music store owners, it was common practice for music store owners to report whatever music genre was not selling well as their ""top hit"" so as to engineer more sales of that genre. This was the way rock 'n' roll made it to the top of the charts in the '70s. So who knows if journal editors are doing the very same thing and influencing publication so that some authors get more visibility than others? We need a new way of doing Science that eliminates all possible personal bias such that we are left with completely objective explanations of the world on which we can base our predictions. Only then can we say, with certainty, that our scientific explanations and predictions of the world are true.

"Supporters of any unifying purpose of sports often cite its ostensibly non-political nature of sports. However, as is our view, this sweeping argument is over-simplistic and neglects the complex and competitive nature of modern sports. Changing modern competitive sports does not promote any greater harmony because sport exacerbates hatred.","Proponents of the uniting power of sports often cite the ostensibly non-political nature of sports. Throughout history, major sporting events have managed to unite groups of people embroiled in conflict, even temporarily. For example, during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, amidst heightening political tensions and conflict, South Korea and Japan managed to put aside their differences in order to collaborate for the sake of a successful World Cup4, with the competition eventually helping the two Asian powerhouses forge a new path of international diplomacy and co-operation. More recently, opposing factions in the civil war in Ivory Coast switched their guns for television remote controls, with a ceasefire called to allow the country to support the national football team in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. In such cases, it is seen that the passion and interest in sports is universal, existing in every person, regardless of race, religion or creed. It is precisely this universal appeal of sports that seems to allow people with vast cultural differences, and even people engaged in fierce conflict, to look past their differences and find a common interest among them. This common interest contributes to increased global integration by reducing people's perception of the differences between them. Therefore, it is argued that the universal appeal of competitive sports allows it to be an effective catalyst for change in this increasingly divided world of ours.
However, it is my belief that such an argument is over-simplistic and neglects the complexity and politically-influenced nature of modern sports. There is no doubt that modern sports has greatly evolved and transformed from the time of the ancient Greeks. Today, modern sports training requires advanced facilities and extensive resources. 5 For example, the US Swimming team invested millions in a computational fluid dynamics software to allow swimmers to analyse their stroke angles and minimise water resistance. Today, the team comprises many of the world's top swimmers. Such facilities often require high capital outlay that can only be provided by governments and, indeed, the inextricable relationship between government funding and competitive sports has thwarted the originally pure intentions of sports. As much as it is a celebration of human physical ability, sports is now being exploited by governments as a political tool. During the 2010 Youth Olympic Games in Singapore, for instance, the Iranian government forced its athlete to withdraw from the taekwondo finals because the Iranian government did not recognise the existence of Israel, the country represented by his opponent. More recently, in the 2016 Rio Olympics, an Egyptian judoka refused to shake the hands of his Israeli opponent for reasons pertaining to his nationality. As seen in these examples, the increasing political influence in sports today has corrupted the noble intentions of sports, and it can contribute to the heightening tensions between countries worldwide. In this respect, the universal appeal of sports has in fact exacerbated its negative influence, with the politically antagonising actions in competitive sports being witnessed by millions around the world. Therefore, the fact that modern competitive sports are no longer non-political necessarily means that the uniting forces of sports are not as strong as they used to be. Moreover, the competitive nature of sports has bred over-competitiveness and athletes. Far from being the celebration of the physical prowess of the human race that sports used to be, today, professional, competitive athletes are overly fixated on winning and finding a reasonable personal justification for the many hours of training they have endured. Such an overly competitive mentality has given rise to rampant unsportsmanlike behaviour in recent times. For example, French captain Thierry Henry admitted to committing an intentional handball foul during the 2009 World Cup playoff finals that led to the goal that killed Ireland's chances of qualifying for the World Cup. This excessive fixation on winning has developed an ""every man for himself""ù attitude, with sportsmen willing to do anything to win. 6 Such attitudes mean that sports today is more of a dividing force than one of unity, since athletes will only be concerned with their self-interest, and be less considerate of others. Similarly, the universal appeal of sports means that sporting fans worldwide risk inherit such mentalities, cultivating a global climate of selfishness and over-fixation on personal interests. Clearly, sports helps to perpetuate a culture of selfishness.
Lastly, modern competitive sports does not allow for greater harmony because it exacerbates inequality. This can be attributed to the culture of celebrity athletes in today's world. The world's top sporting stars often earn exorbitantly high wages for their contributions in the sporting arena. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo commands a post-tax wage of over US$370,000 a week. Often, sports stars even earn money outside of their sport. For example, Tiger Woods has earned a staggering 100 million dollars just from endorsing Nike products alone. While the intangible social benefits of star athletes can be debated, the fact is that these competitive sports stars do not contribute much tangibly and directly to society, be it in the form of creating employment, educating children or protecting the disadvantaged. Therefore, dedicating such large sums of money to athletes cannot be justified and can be considered an excessive over allocation of society's scarce resources to them. Such a trend exacerbates social inequality, with huge profits not just concentrated in the hands of giant corporations, but also in the hands of sports stars. This income inequality will only cause greater social unrest, with the disadvantaged and needy receiving fewer resources, and therefore, the celebrity culture of competitive sports will not result in greater integration, but worsen and exacerbate economic differences.

"The inexorable forces of globalisation rapidly established a global community. Before we overly criticize foreign intervention as utterly misguided I would first like to say that, to some extent, it may be warranted and intervention prove justified upon moral or humanitarian grounds. Along the same vein, one may argue that foreign intervention is positive as it provides aid to a country which was desperate for help, and in so doing, prevents negative ripple effects in the region. ","The inexorable forces of globalisation have swept the global community. For better or for worse, the world is increasingly interconnected and integrated in terms of our economy, politics, and people. This has engendered a situation where one country's internal affairs can easily create spill-over effects that will affect other countries. Furthermore, many countries have taken it upon themselves to intervene in other countries' affairs, be it militarily, politically or via provision of foreign aid. A cursory examination of the issue may lead one to conclude that, indeed, foreign intervention may be desirable and hence justified as it provides salvation for a country confronted by difficult circumstances. However, lessons from the past and present have led me to take a more pessimistic view of the situation: I believe that foreign intervention in another country's problems is largely unjustified, especially in view of how such ""intervention""ù is carried out today ""ì often with hegemonic, self-interested and regrettably vicious intentions. The only exception would be when countries truly attempt to intervene with altruistic motives, but such instances are few and far between. 
Before we overly condemn foreign intervention as utterly unjustified, I would first like to qualify that, to some extent, it can be warranted should intervention be based on moral and altruistic grounds. This view may seem highly idealistic taking into account the realpolitik nature of foreign policies practised by many countries, but such examples of noble intervention exist. For instance, in the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Nargis experienced by Myanmar, the country was thrown into turmoil as infrastructure was destroyed, large populations were displaced from their homes, and the government was plunged into a tumultuous state. As a symbol of goodwill, ASEAN nations took it upon themselves to intervene in the situation, sending aid and manpower to Myanmar to help ameliorate the crisis. Slowly but surely, the country began to get back on its feet, undoubtedly with the assistance of its neighbouring counterparts. What was interesting was that, following this, the Myanmese military junta was more open to hold talks with ASEAN leaders, and was also more willing to acquiesce to the demands of ASEAN. Arguably, this was a step in the right direction towards building bridges with a previously isolated country and helping to put Myanmar on the path towards free and democratic intervention.  Admittedly, when foreign intervention is carried out with goodwill and no hidden agenda whatsoever, then the aid provided will be channelled towards areas where the recipient country is truly deficient in and more likely be effective in remedying its problems. Furthermore, in a global context, such actions create mutual trust and goodwill between countries which is paramount in establishing regional stability. Therefore, in such a context of intervention being provided based on moral motivations, I would concede that foreign intervention is justified and, in fact, highly welcomed.
In the same vein, others may argue that foreign intervention is justified as it provides salvation to a country that is unable to help itself, and in so doing, prevents negative spill-over effects in the region. In certain situations, be it natural disasters or wars, weaker and poorer nations may be immobilised and weighed down, their governments unable to undertake the proper measures to alleviate the problems. For instance, during the Gulf War in the 1990s, when Saddam Hussein's Iraq first invaded Kuwait and overran the country, the Kuwaitis were left shocked, helpless and oppressed. And with a weak military force, they could do nothing but wait helplessly for help from foreign neighbours. Threatened by Saddam's expansionist agendas and afraid that they too would be targets of his aggression, Kuwait's Middle-Eastern neighbours, with help from the US, decided to intervene, driving Iraqi forces back to its border and liberating Kuwait. Ostensibly, it seems that countries subject to unfortunate ""black swan""ù events have no power whatsoever to defend themselves from incoming threats.

"Prima: it may appear as though religion only results in bigotry and hostility because religious believers congregate and pit themselves as other people may not practice the same particular faith. Furthermore, it is another largely isolated case that highlights the persistence of religious division. At the individual level, religion holds a tremendous power in moving believers over the spectrum in fellowship and provides a sense of belonging in the larger community.","Prima facie, it would appear as though religion only results in bigotry and prejudice, where pious believers congregate and pit themselves against other who do not share the same zealous faith. This may be especially so for the case of religious fundamentalist whose entire sense of self and purpose for existence revolve around subservience to their deity. The crisis in the Middle East is a glaring example of how seemingly irreconcilable differences in religious beliefs have led to widespread sectarian violence and rancour. The Islamic State, or more commonly referred to as ISIS, is an extreme case of how religion not only divides but instigates people to act on their hatred against non-believers, as adduced by the indiscriminate genocide of other religious minorities by the religious terrorists who use scripture in an unprecedented manner to justify their barbaric murders in the name of establishing a Muslim caliphate and view themselves  as the harbinger of the imminent Judgement Day. While religion indeed seems to be the reason for the fragmentation in the Middle East, to place the blame of this division on religion would be to neglect the plethora of other factors that have contributed to this state of desolation. For this given example, it should be acknowledged that the issue is multi-factorial and the divide also encompasses other social and political complexities. Much of the discord can also be attributed to how the Sunni majority in Syria has long been ruled by the oppressive Shite minority, which has refused to large swathes of the population freedom of religious expression and politic emancipation. Under the Assad regime, innocent civilians have been exposed to chemical attack by the militia and it is more so the denial of political rights and excess to basic welfare that has culminated in the morbid retaliation by the disenfranchised factions, leading to the misconception that conflict and division is ostensibly religion in nature.
Furthermore, this is a largely isolated case that shows the extremes of religious division. Depending on how religious differences in a society are managed, religion could conversely bring about cohesion and stability. When accompanied by amiable and open dialogue, and the display of a willingness to compromise and respect those of all religions, religious differences can be tolerated to create a community of acceptance. While this may sound idealistic, it has been in fact realized in Lebanon with the unique form of confessionalism it practices in its government structure, where the President is always a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni and the Head of Defence a Druze. Although the country still has much progress to make, the fair representation of the various religions in its government ensures that the rights of each religion are vehemently safeguarded, therefore averting schismatic fall-out or a nation-state conflict and showing that instead of dividing, religion, when moderated by temperance and tolerance, can in fact create a framework of greater unity in spite of the inherent differences. In addition, religion can be a force to strengthen relationships and cement diplomatic ties at the international level. The shared Muslim religion across the countries situated in close proximity to the Persian Gulf has untied the region and facilitated cross-border business transactions, leading to one of the most effective and well-coordinated economic cooperation-the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). While the alliance is mostly motivated by prospects of economic gains, due to the shared religious values and principles in business, bring about great prosperity of the partnering nations. Bahrain serves as the regional banking centre and follows strict Sharia Law. Since all the countries similarly observe the same rules, it has allowed researchers and scholars to obtain the necessary funds to finance their projects and business endeavours in these countries. What is even more remarkable is that Bahrain is Shiite dominated, while all other member-nations of the GCC comprise a Sunni majority. This astounding success serves as evidence that religion does in fact have a unifying effect in the modern world.
At the individual level, religion has a great power in linking believers across the world in fellowship and provides a sense of belonging to a larger entity. With nearly 1.3 billion Muslims worldwide, a million Catholics and Christians, and half a million more Buddhists and Hindus each, religion does indeed have of the ability to create an ineffable sense of brotherhood and connection. In this fast paced world of rapid changes where people are growing ever tired of sprinting on the hedonic treadmill and in the context of crass materialism and avarice perpetuated by the media, religion imparts on its followers the lessons of altruism and exhorts them to care for the disadvantaged and marginalized segments of society, where otherwise they could lose themselves in the selfish culture of consumerism. The values of love, kindness and benevolence are embodied in the Christian commandment ""love thy neighbour as thyself""ù, the Jewish Law of ""heal the world""ù, and similarly in the Muslim injunction ""look to charity as something you must do every day that the sun rises""ù. Given these invaluable teachings common across all religions and how religion offers opportunity for self-reflection in an atmosphere of sincere humility, accompanied by spiritual enlightenment and self-actualization, many individuals have come forward to contribute to society to create a more inclusive environment where all can be united despite the different socio-economic backgrounds. Such is displayed by the commendable service initiatives by faith based charity organisations such as HOPE Worldwide, which encourage volunteerism and offers aid to all regardless of race, class, creed or religion.

"One of these lawsuits threatens to the individual's freedom to govern themselves, and the freedom in protecting a private life and private communications. The right of free expression is generally accepted as a common good. However, even when a threat to privacy is viewed by citizens as a safeguard against the State, it is viewed as our State: a barrier from power an impediment to power. ","Each of these acts threatens both an individual's freedom to express themselves, and their right to maintain a private life and private communications. In this way, privacy and free expression are two sides of the same coin, each an essential prerequisite to the survival of the other. To freely form and impart one's political, religious or ethnical beliefs, one needs an autonomous, private space free from interference from the State, private sector or other citizens. Equally, infringements on the right to privacy ""ì physical or online surveillance,monitoring of communications or activities, State intrusion into private, family or home affairs ""ì prevent an individual from exercising their freedom of expression. Such considerations are important, for in the modern world, almost every act online is an act of expression. Participating in an online chat, networking with friends and colleagues, surfing websites, reading news and downloading files -- these are all acts of imparting or accessing information. In online interactivity, there is content generated and stored, some of which is publicly available, most of which is amongst select individuals and groups. Yet each of these acts also generates transactional information, and can be monitored by unintended parties. In turn, nearly every act of expression is now observable to communications providers, and in turn, the State. This scrutiny is without precedent. We could previously communicate with our friends and colleagues without it being known to anyone else. We could move around cities, countries and continents and meet with whomever we wished without it being known. We could follow and join groups and movements without having to disclose identities. The ability to act without being observed was innate to the act of expression and we benefited from privacy as we expressed ourselves by living our personal, political and professional lives. Most importantly, we believed that these were rights worth protecting, enshrining in constitutions and promoting through advocacy and protecting in law.
The protection of free expression is now generally considered a common good. Some States speak out in favour of its protection and admonish those who do not support it in the modern era, and in particular for the internet. No State, however, promotes the right to privacy. Now, when States speak often of promoting free speech and the importance of facilitating access to and use of the internet and new technologies, they rarely admit the implications of new technologies for the right to privacy. They support free expression in the modern context while ignoring the right to privacy that has so long enabled and supported free expression. The failure of the international community to develop stronger support for the right to privacy may be due to the challenges in defining the content and contours of this right. It is undeniable that privacy does face a changing environment. New forms of data generation, storage, processing and surveillance have made it far from a static concept; its content and confines are being contested in never-ending games between individuals, governments and corporations; our own notions of privacy vary greatly across historical periods, cultures and places. Understanding and protecting privacy is also challenged by the constant evolution of technologies that transform the way we think about the private and public spheres. Technological change alters our relationships and interactions with governments and the corporate sector. It also changes how we think about the realisation and protection of human rights. In order to enjoy privacy of communications individuals must be able to exchange information and ideas in a space beyond the reach of the State, the private sector and other members of society. As technologies increase the reach of the State, place power in the hands of the private sector and create new societies and citizenries online, privacy protection is increasingly crucial.
However, even as the right to privacy is viewed by citizens as their safeguard from the State, it is viewed by the State as a barrier to control, an impediment to power. Privacy is at the heart of the most basic understandings of human dignity ""ì the ability to make autonomous choices about our lives and relationships, without outside interference or intimidation, is central to who we are as human beings. Yet by the State that seeks to control its populace, it is viewed as an impediment, and is conceptualised as hampering security, development, and modernisation. Thus, individuals are forced to choose between starkly contrasting values: on one side there is dignity, freedom and individual rights. On the other, convenience, control and national security. All of these are false choices, pitting technology as a means for evil and privacy, the preserve of darker forces in society. The idea that we must choose between privacy and security has too often pervaded the political and economic discourses, creating false dichotomies and spurring over-simplified arguments about the roles of technologies. The discussion reveals no consideration of the values and priorities tied up in privacy and security, no reference to the potentials of technology and no indication of the other choices that exist. It has instead cast security and privacy as competing concepts, rather than mutually reinforcing values. Technologies have blurred the line between public and private thought and expression; courts across the globe are confounded by questions about how to characterise social media musings and blogs, how to think about data like location, IP addresses and cookies. Today, more than ever, privacy and free expression are interlinked; an infringement upon one can be both the cause and consequence of an infringement upon the other. This is likewise so in the case of communications surveillance. The things an individual says to another person, their intimate feelings and opinions: each of these pieces of information is incredibly sensitive and personal. They have long been considered the preserve of an individual's private life, yet they are now exposed to infiltration by the State without the need for consent or exceptional justification.","[0.3310972688068999, 0.30921578022680085, 0.3596869509662993]"
"Cells that believe Maths to be impossible were not entirely mistaken. Yet, while such examples do raise salient questions concerning the value of Mathematics, it continues to argue for Mathematic's focus towards universal categories of conceptual thought. The greatest objection to such a view, however is: Mathematics can be reduced to a few more mathematical rules. ","Those who believe Maths to be meaningless are not entirely mistaken. Mathematical activities that seem to have no corresponding physical reality are abundant in mathematical calculations ""ì the square root of 2 is not an observable value, and neither are imaginary numbers, or negative numbers. The prevalence of abstract quantities, especially in the recent evolution of our Mathematics, reasonably puzzles the common man, who sees no value in such made-up concepts. The studies of pure Mathematics seem directionless and aimless in themselves, and are more often than not merely fanciful whims of the mathematician considering the various possibilities that could arise in tweaking one step of the equation, or another. In addition, Mathematics seems to be subject to the changing tastes and preferences of the community that engages in the activity. Theorems, such as the nine-point-theorem, that once captivated numerous mathematicians have faded into the background as newer, fresher and more exciting problems arise. Criteria for what constitutes an interesting problem or an elegant proof change constantly. In this way, theories may not be discarded for no longer holding true, but can easily be deemed as unimportant and forgotten easily. This greatly undermines the meaning that Mathematics holds.
Yet, while such views do raise certain questions about the value of Mathematics, it fails to account for Mathematics' focus on universal categories of human thought. Mathematics deals with ideas that are far too naturally ingrained in our perceptions to simply be an abstract product for entertainment. The human sense and understanding of numbers if an innate and irreducible mode of perception ""ì children immediately recognize pairs and threesomes. Just like how we cannot but see the world in colour, we naturally identify quantities in all perceptions. Examples from history also illustrate this. Almost every single human civilization known has developed a language or medium for communicating numerical quantities. While conceptions of numbers may not always be uniform, such as the concept of zero only being invented much later in mankind's history, the integral nature of mathematical concept cannot be denied. According to Kant's categories of the human mind, human beings naturally adopt a mathematical lens when viewing the world. Being thus instinctive and natural, the view of Mathematics as a game created without meaning seems incompatible to human experience. In fact, in examining the origins of Mathematics, we see that Maths itself was conceived for a purpose that goes beyond satisfying game players. Mathematics is not only inspired by the reality that we exist in, but also enables us to understand this reality. Seemingly pointless formulas of differentiation and integration actually originated from the need to calculate rates of change of everyday moving objects. The coordinate plane stemmed from a need to characterize space effectively and efficiently. Mathematics was therefore not created as a game but as a means to interact with reality. Furthermore, as Eugene Wigner once said, Mathematics has an ""unreasonable effectiveness""ù in characterizing and explaining phenomena of the natural world. Newton found that planets move around the sun in perfect elliptical orbits that correspond to the intersection of a plane and a cone. Planets move around the sun under the influence of a force that is exactly the inverse of the square of the distance between the sun and the planet. Even pure mathematic, which seems to have no correlation to physical reality, has been found at times to fit explanations in physics like a glove. According to the indispensability argument, if we are to believe in the reality of scientific phenomena in everyday reality, we need to believe in the Mathematics that facilitates their explanation. Mathematics shares such an unquestionable relationship with science that its value cannot be questioned ""ì Mathematics enables us to interpret the real world. The answers that are found in mathematical problems are not meaningless; they old in themselves the explanations to scientific phenomena. Mathematics is not a game, but an enterprise of knowledge geared towards constructing knowledge about the real world and seeking truths that we as humans hold as important. This is further supported by the fact that Mathematics seems to naturally arise in nature. Musical harmonies occur in simple mathematical ratios, flowers are patterned by the Fibonacci sequence, and even beauty can be attributed to the mathematical golden ratio. Are these coincidences? The prevalence and regularity of these instances in nature suggest not. How then, can Mathematics be a game created by man?
The greatest objection to such a view, perhaps, is that Mathematics cannot be reduced to a set of formal rules. Godel's incompleteness theorem proves that no sufficiently expressive mathematical system can be both complete and consistent at the same time, thus rejecting the possibility that Mathematics is simply a game played according to certain rules. In view of this, in order to argue that Mathematics is meaningless, one cannot undermine the inherent importance of Mathematics, but only the certainty it accords. Mathematics has always been heralded as the pinnacle area of knowledge for its seeming indubitability. Indeed, the notion that 1+1=2 could be false seems ridiculous. Yet, the axiom-theorem structure that may hold as the pillar of certainty may not be sufficient. While theorems are deductively derived, the certainty of Maths can be undermined by demonstrating the axioms to be false. For instance, Euclidean geometry relies on the axiom that the shortest distance between two points is a line, but Riemannian geometry states that it is a curve. This raises questions about which axiom are true and whether axioms themselves are always certain. Yet both sets of mathematical systems built upon these axioms have proven to be useful in formulating scientific theories such as Newton's laws of gravitation and Einstein's theory of relativity.

"Critics of my theory that fashion can be considered art are quick to point out where art can be considered an artistic form when it remains simplistic and inconsistent with style and intent. However, that does not speak for other forms of fashion. Sometimes fashion can become categorised as art when art is integrated in an accessory by the designer to provide visual commentary. ","Critics of the notion that fashion can be considered art are quick to point out that it cannot be considered an art form when it is simplistic and repetitive in design and intent. This is especially true of today's fast fashion industry, which, for the most part, merely churns out clothes and accessories that display minimal variety in design. These may not even be purposeful with respect to intent. Brands such as Forever 21 or H&M have long invited criticism for simply ""following existing trends"", catering to demands of consumers without innovating significantly or creating unique or distinctive designs. Given that a piece of work ought to show clear evidence of the creator's unique skills and intent in order to qualify as art, fast fashion brands usually fail to meet the criteria. This is perhaps due to the need for fast fashion to, after all, provide for consumer demand, rather than to be of any artistic value. Since consumers of fast fashion tend to look for clothes and accessories that are in trend, fashion brands reosrt to mass-producing garments that are less distinctive and more repetitive in their design, thus rendering fast fashion incapable of being considered art. 
However, this does not hold for all forms of fashion. Fashion can be considered art when it is effective in expressing clear artistic intent on the point of the designer and at times, the model wearing the design. One of the defining features of an artwork is when the artist's purpose of creation is conveyed to the viewer. This is vital as it helps the viewer understand the context of the art in order to better appreciate the aesthetic value in it. Therefore, fashion qualifies as art when such a purpose behind its creation is clearly evident. For instance, the Met Gala 2018 saw an extensive array of clothes and garments that celebrated its theme of religion. Among them was pop musician Rihanna's outfit which garnered applause from critics for being a ""statement"" piece, having been adapted from and heavily inspired by the robes of the Pope. Rihanna and her designer later clarified that her garments were meant to indicate that women were capable of assuming positions of power even in the area of religion. This is an example of how designs that are furnished with evidence of strong artistic expression are more likely to be perceived as art. Thus, when fashion designers and their models utilise their work as a platform to express creatively, fashion can be considered art.
Additionally, fashion can be categorised as art when it is used as an avenue by the designer to provide social commentary. Aayush Kejiriwal and Tarun Tahiliani, two south Asian designers, have drawn attention to their creations by hiring dark-skinned models as opposed to those with fairer complexions, although the latter has been viewed as a beauty standard in south Asian communities for centuries. By taking an active stand against colourism in the fashion industry and challenging the status quo with regards to conventional expectations of beauty, these designers are using the craft as a platform to raise awareness about ingrained mindsets in the south Asian community and to question societal norms. In doing so, fashion designers are enabling, to a large extent, fashion to be on par with other art forms that are used by artists to highlight social issues or problems. In this aspect, fashion can be considered art.

"What this # Wetoo campaign across Japan have shown are the shocking level of discrimination against women in the Japanese society and how little progress is being made in the country, despite Prime Minister Abe's promises of improving the situation for women in the country. In the familial sphere as young women has started to take on an equal amount of responsibility. The wave happening only among mothers but also young women has been worsening in the spread of rape culture interspersed by physical advances.","What the #Wetoo campaign in Japan has shown is the shocking amount of discrimination against women in the Japanese workplace, and how little progress has been made in the country, despite Prime Minister Abe's promises of improving the situation for women in the workplace. This underscores that despite the global and largely liberal trend in support for equality between the genders in creating opportunities for both men and women, limited progress has been made due to the difficulties in changing mindsets and a lack of effective government policies. Despite Abe's claims of being in huge support of women in terms of economic and social empowerment, there remains a significant lack of political representation, with a severe lack of women in his own administration. This points us towards the stagnating and limited improvements of women's rights in the wokrplace as well as politically. 
In the familial sphere as well, women has had to take on an increasing load of burden. With financial empowerment, a hugely uplifting development in the developed world is the increase in the number of working women, not only in fields more traditionally ""meant for women"", but even in industries dominated by men such as in engineering and the upper echelons in the world of business. However, the huge strides of change in the workplace have not been matched with the public's opinion and views of roles of the husband and wife in the family unit. Mothers are still expected to play the dominant role is housework as well as child-rearing, and even the father's roles in housework stereotypically include gardening or washing the car, which are less routine jobs that take up much less time within a week. The result of this is a disproportionate amount of stress shouldered by working mothers compared to their male partners. This is not only emphasized in families but also propagated in the workplace, where many countries have less or no paternity leave, indicating that the mother is mainly responsible for childcare. With such a double-barrel burden on women, it could be said that the stress placed on working mothers has greatly worsened, due to the failure of people's mindsets and stereotypes to keep pace with the financial empowerment of women.
The situation not only for mothers but also young women has been worsening in the spread of pop culture interspersed with technological developments. The emergence of unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards as well as the propagation of related online materials via social media has reinforced unhealthy body images among teens, especially young women. This is aggravated by the manipulation of these images using Photoshop to make individuals look skinnier, fairer or blemishless, fostering warped interpretations of beauty among consumers. This is coupled with corporations commercializing and selling beauty to women via diet pills or slimming plans such as London Weight Management. In South Korea, for example, beauty has always been of utmost importance, and this has been reinforced by stick-thin K-pop idols in the industry, leading to cosmetic surgery becoming commonplace among young teens. Moreover, girls increasingly younger have encountered enating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia due to unhealthy mindsets and standards of beauty imposed upon them. Hence, to a large extent, young women are having it worse today than ever, due to the constantly rising pressures of society to meet standards of ideality in physical appearance.

"Less should be denied that tourism can be a boon for both host and host economies for it benefits only records economic progress but significantly reduces the vast inequalities in wealth and skills between developing or developed countries. European migration has improved some plight of the less fortunate in advanced countries, while worsening the effect of brain damage in developing countries. Group migration has caused increased social tensions in developing countries and increased social fragmentation in host countries. ","It cannot be denied that migration can be a boon for both host and destination countries, for it not only furthers economic progress but also reduces the persistant inequalities in wealth and skills between developing and developed countries. In many developing countries, infrastructure and technological know-how remains severely lacking, serving as a deterrence to foreigninvestment and leading to a stagnant job market. Even for the fortunate ones who receive a decent education, the dearth of white collar jobs mean that they are frequently underemployed in jobs which do not put their skills to productive use. On the other hand, in the developed world, changing aspirations and improving educational attainment-accompanied by a rise in the number of university graduates-have contributed to a perennial shortage of workers in 3'D' (dirty, difficult and dangerous) jobs. It is not surprising thatfirms in labour intensive industries like the construction sector would welcome such as influx of migrants, which has the advantage of keeping wages competitive. Migrants are also better-off from seeking employment overseas as the comparatively higher purchasing power of foreign currency means that their wages, regarded as meagre in local terms, is often worth a small fortunate back home. Most of all, these remittances often contribute to improving infrastructure and allowing their children to access better educational and health services, helping individual families break out of the poverty cycle. In the long run, if the migrants make their return journey home, they may pass on the skills and knowledge gained to their home country, spurring economic development on a larger scale. For example, returning migrants from America are responsible for founding the equivalents of Silicon Valley in Taiwan, Mumbai and Shanghai. Even in more economically backward countries like the Philippines, remittances from domestic workers abroad continue to comprise double-digit percentages of GDP. On a global scale, such mass movements are no doubt beneficial as they help to counter unsustainable demographic trends. Most developed countries in the West face an aging population while developing countries are often overpopulated. Hence some would say that migration ought to be strongly encouraged. 
Clearly, migration has worsened the plight of the less skilled in developed countries, while worsening the problem of brain drain in developing countries. In many developed countries, the influx of migrants has stiffened competitionfor employment among the lower-income, threatening the livelihoods of those who are unable to move up the skill ladder. Recently, the displacement of local Britons from their traditional employment by migrants from poorer Eastern European countries was a possible contributing factor to the Brexit vote. Even in developing countries where migration seems to be a remedy for economic growth, migration has often hindered economic progress in subtler ways. Poverty-stricken countries are deprived of much-need talent when their best and brightest minds leave en masse in search of better work opportunities abroad. Presently, more Liberian doctors work in Chicago than in their home country. The loss of such valuable talent is highly pernicious, especially in today's knowledge-based economy where the value of educationalqualifications has multiplied exponentially. Indeed, Liberia was caught wrongfooted when the Ebola epidemic struck in the 2010s, finding itself unable to mount an effective response with its limited number of trained medical personnel. Hence, immigration should be discouraged as it causes inequitable and distorted growth, and may potentially worsen the prospects of lowincome workers and less developed countries. 
Moreover, migration has also increased social tensions in host countries and caused social fragmentation in destination countries. Migrants may not be aware of the cultural norms and appropriate standards of behaviour in host countries, fuelling misunderstandings and possible conflicts. This is exemplified by Singapore's ""òcurry' incident when a PRC immigrant complained about the smell of her Indian's neighbour cooking, prompting an outpouring of antiimmigrant vitriol online. In other societies, where authorities have not made an active effort to promote integration, migrants are more comfortable living with fellow migrants in homogeneous communities, leading highly segregated lives. The resulting social alienation can have severe effects. Recent terror attacks have cast a spotlight on Muslim immigrant ghettos in Europe, where migrants, largely disconnected from wider society, are susceptible to the influence of extremist ideology. Many lone-wolf terrorists such as Salah Abdeslam, who was responsible for the November 2015 bombings in France, have subsequently been identified as hailing from such ghettos. Furthermore, families are often separated as migrants are often too destitute to bring their family along, causing personal relationships to become estranged. In China, where rural-urban migration is a mass phenomenon, rural migrants may only meet their families infrequently during festive occasions like Chinese New Year. Among rural children, those brought up without the nurturing influence of their parents have been reported to show higher incidences of depressive disorders and delinquent behaviour. Hence, migration ought to be discouraged as it tends to be a divisive force with a negative bearing on the social fabric of a country.

"Perhaps one significant reason why the general public may perceive video programming to only hold entertainment value is the way games sell and get marketed. Yet the mere reason that video games were highly effective at expanding their medium does not exclude them from fulfilling other purposes in modern society. Next, cars can also serve as an important force for social change, as they encode technological innovations that can have an important effect on many generations. ","Perhaps one significant reason why the general public may perceive video games to only have entertainment value is the way they tend to be marketed. In posters and television advertisements, video games are often depicted as fun, cool, and exciting ""î characteristics which resonate with the key demographic that gaming companies wish to attract, teenagers. In today's world, youths are often stressed-out, overworked, and in desperate need of a break from theireducational and co-curricular commitments. Hence, they are naturally drawn towards a form of entertainment that seems exactly what it claims to be ""î a way to destress; nothing more and nothing less. Video games are now specifically designed to offer the maximum amount of fun in the minimum amount of time. One such game is Pokemon Go, which shook the gaming industry by racking up millions of downloads and grossing millions of dollarswithin the first few weeks of its release on the App Store. Its ground-breaking popularity and success can largely be attributed to one thing ""î its entertainment value. Like all other video games, Pokemon Go was  designed to allow players ""î in this case, self-appointed Pokemon Trainers ""î to have fun. There are few hidden motives here with regards to what game engineers wish to offer players. Fundamentally, a video game's purpose is to entertain players, and any other benefits that they might enjoy are often ancillary and accidental.
Nevertheless, the mere fact that video games are highly effective at entertaining their audiences does not exclude them from fulfilling other purposes in our society. As game manufacturers and engineers continually aspire towards creating the most fun, creative, or immersive games, they simultaneously drive the development and spread of new technologies that households can benefit greatly from. For example, in trying to compress the Pokemon Gold software into the minuscule 1MB afforded by its Game Boycartridge, Nintendo engineers had to invent a new method of data storage ""ì a discovery that later trickled down to the entire gaming industry. More recently, the development of gaming decides and consoles has seen new, highly innovative technologies reach consumers at an even quicker pace than before. Households can now purchase Microsoft's Xbox Kinect from retailers at about US$500 a set, making motion control technology more accessible and affordable than ever before. Augmented reality headsets like the Oculus Rifthave also been hitting the shelves, such that one can now experience a virtual reality rollercoaster or his favourite rock star's concert with incredible realism, all without leaving his living room 9. This extraordinary spread of new technology would have been impossible without video games, as consumer demand drives manufacturers to continually refine new and upcoming forms of technology, bringing them to the market more quickly and affordably. Hence, video games ""î empowered and driven by the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on them annually ""î provide the incentive for the constant improvement and refinement of technology, and consequently do more than just entertain.
Next, video games also serve as an important force for social change, as they encode many messages that can have an extensive impact on future generations. Since video games are played so widely and frequently by people from all walks of life, the principles that they encompass can act as catalysts to alter the mindsets of their audiences. For example,  the original Mario games only allowed players to take on the avatar of Mario in their adventures to rescue Princess Peach from the enemy, King Bowser. This perpetuated the ""damsel-in-distress""ù stereotype of women being weak and unable to fend for themselves, which was not only unfairly sexist, but also deprived female gamers of the opportunity to pick an avatar that they identified with. However, this trope has since been subverted in the more recent Super Princess Peach video game, where, in a contemporary role-reversal, Princess Peach was tasked withsaving Mario from King Bowser. This has helped to reinforce the message that girls, too, can defeat evil villains, and that being a hero is not an exclusively male appointment. Progressive video games like these might not revolutionise the world, but the small cultural shifts that they do create should not be discounted. They challenge the status quo, and remind players that they have the capacity to be protagonists of their own lives, regardless of their gender, age, or race. Hence, video games can be seen as microcosms of society, as the messages they embody allow their audiences to be empowered, making them an important catalyst for social change.

"There are many different forms practicing freedom. Another reason why AI feels detrimental to democracy is that humans are weird and unpredictable. However, freedom have also been very constructive, beneficial to all","There are many different kinds of freedom. One of them is the freedom of speech. This is something that many people are extremely passionate about and believe is a basic human right. For instance, American society has always heralded their embrace of free speech.10 However, free speech can have verydetrimental impacts on society due to humans being inherently selfish beings: people do not necessarily consider the impact of their words on the larger society. When given the freedom to speak their mind, more often than not controversial topics are brought up or oppressive personal views are expressed and in the process, feelings are hurt and conflict ensues. Sometimes even safety of the people involved is threatened. For instance, in Singapore the infamous Anton Casey incident taught Singaporeans how large an impact their words can have. After being incessantly shamed and bullied online for saying some controversial things about Singapore society, Anton Casey started receiving death threats. Eventually, he was forced to flee the country for his own safety. While it can be argued that Singaporeans were simply expressing themselves freely, this is a prime example of how people do not know how not to abuse this right given to them. Instead of using the freedom to speak what is on their mind for the betterment of society, they use it to harm one another. As such, we can see how freedom can be detrimental and destructive for society.
Another reason why freedom is detrimental to society is that humans are volatile and unpredictable. Humans therefore cannot be trusted to utilise their autonomy responsibly. Ultimately humans, given the freedom, the right to do what they want without regulation can lead to the destabilising of society. People, being unpredictable, act on their instincts and this can result indevastation. An example that exemplifies this phenomenon would be that of the Sandy Hook Elementary shootings. A man murdered several children and a few teachers from the elementary school by shooting them before shooting himself just as the police arrived. This incident tore apart many of the children's families and broke the world's heart. Several countries offered their condolences to America in that dark time. However, everyone knew that the reason that such a tragedy had occurred in the first place was due to the unregulated ownership of guns in America. The freedom that Americans possess to own a gun has proved, time and time again, to be extremely destructive for society. Shootings have become commonplace in their society. The freedom to own a gun gives Americans the ability to exercise control over it, to whatever degree they choose to. The unpredictability and fallibility of the human mind results in many guns landing in the wrong hands and being used for wrong purposes. Chaos and tragedy ensues. Hence, it is evident how freedom for humans to be able to act on their impulses can be extremely harmful to society.
However, freedom has also been very constructive and beneficial to society. The freedom of expression allows humans to express themselves through many mediums. This freedom has led to the creation of masterpieces in the form of literary works, symphonies, paintings and so much more. The need to express oneself is a very fundamental and crucial one for humans and has been since the beginning of our existence. This right to release our thoughts and emotions has led to the creation of an arts culture and arts scene that thrives. As art is subjective and a coping mechanism for many, it should be unregulated. This freedom allows artists to create beautiful, diverse works and when a community allows for this to happen, cultural appreciation is sure to follow. In Singapore, the local arts scene is very diverse and appreciates all races and cultures equally. A visit to the Singapore Art Museum will reveal art works created by local artists of many different ethnicities, their art being influenced by their heritage. This appreciation of all the different art forms, from shadow puppetry to bharatnatyam encourages people to be not just tolerant of one another's cultures but to go one step beyond and appreciate it as well. The freedom for artists of all backgrounds to express themselves is what presents such an opportunity for appreciation and learning in the first place. Without the right to create and be creative, society would without a doubt be a much less accepting and vibrant place. Hence, the freedom to express and create, which allows for the creation of art, is vital and undeniably constructive for society's welfare.

"Medical advancements have a noble and original purpose, to improve the lives & welfare of people. Regulations, particularly those imposed by US courts are essential because they provide clear boundaries between fair and wrong, which are particularly vital for the world of technology, where new breakthroughs by applications have developed so quickly. On the other hand internal borders are definitely beneficial for exploring foreign developments, overly strict regulations might not be able to better protect those who are exploited. ","Technological developments have a main and original purpose, to improve the lives and welfare of mankind. When it loses its purpose however, it has the potential to become exploitative instead, hence such developments would have to be regulated by the government or relevant bodies of authority, to prevent a loss of welfare for those involved. The lucrative nature of the technological industry is a tempting one, and may prompt firms to make use of technology to increase their profits, sometimes at the expense of the welfare of the good's consumers or even producers. Commercial surrogacy is a prime example of this. This multi-million dollar industry, especially rampant in countries like India or Thailand, makes use of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and poor surrogate mothers to produce babies for rich couples who are unable or unwilling to conceive themselves. These surrogate mothers are often illiterate and unaware about the health risks of renting out their wombs and they are exploited by the firms in the industry as they receive little compensation for their services, despite having to bear all the risks. In the process, babies born out of this surrogacy are also treated as commodities which may be abandoned if born with defects, raising severe questions about the sanctity of human life and other ethical issues. While the development of IVF has enabled many infertile couples to have children the unregulated use of it created exploitative industries such as commercial surrogacy, hence regulations are needed to protect the welfare of those involved and to ensure that the technology serves a good and useful purpose.
Regulations, particularly those imposed by the government, are essential because they provide clear boundaries of right and wrong, which is especially important in the world of technology, where new breakthroughs and applications are developed so quickly. Regulations need to be implemented to ensure that the uses and developments of the technology are safe and beneficial, instead of harmful, for the general public and the common men. Take the case of military drones in the US for example. While they are an efficient way to carry out surveillance and to kill, if necessary, there is also a danger that soldiers will become desensitised to enemy killings, since they are so far removed from the act and its aftereffects. This could lead to increased danger for innocent civilians, such as those who were killed in the drone strikes carried out at Syria and Afghanistan. It is precisely the lax regulation by the US government regarding the use of drones that has led to many questions about the boundaries or lack thereof this drone usage should be subjected to. The need for regulations is alsohighlighted in the production and sale of genetically modified food, which on its own is a technological development that offers a solution to eradicating poverty and hunger in the world. In reality however, the farmers in charge of this food production are charged excessively for their seeds by firms like Monsanto. These firms create and sell seeds that promise high yield and are more weatherresistant, but which can only be used for a single year. Farmers are thus forced to keep purchasing new seeds that would negatively affect their welfare. Regulations should therefore be imposed strictly to protect the welfare of all mankind against these potentially harmful technological developments and practices, as well as to ensure that the technology is used for good.
On the other hand, while regulations are definitely necessary in exploitative technological developments, overly strict regulations might not be able to better protect those who are exploited. In fact, they may end up exacerbating the problem and making it worse, if governmental regulations force these harmful activities and practices to go underground, away from the radar of the government. Problems might have been resolved on the surface but in reality, these regulations could lead to an even greater exploitation of those involved. In the case of commercial surrogacy, India is currently implementing a blanket ban over these practices but this is unlikely to protect the welfare of surrogate mothers, who may be treated even more unfairly now that the industry is illegal. It would thus be harder for the government to track these industries and to protect the surrogate mothers if such strict regulations were imposed. The same also goes for stem cell therapy, which at the moment is illegal in the United States as well as many countries but still continues to thrive due to its promise of cures to diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The clinics use stem cell technology on desperate patients with incurable diseases but this could cause patients to develop negative side effects like tumours, hence severely harming their welfare. Despite legislative measures put in place to prevent such practices, these clinics still exist and conduct business through illegal means, with patients travelling to other less-regulated countries for the treatment. This not only shows the futility of some legislative regulations but also shows that if implemented too strictly, it will just be even more difficult for the government to protect the welfare of the population.

"For the Australian writer Roger Pree the notion of memory might have been man made, but that wouldn't work on to me. Today, we see when nostalgia interacts with issues most governments deem important. Modern nostalgia has their critics. ","For the French writer Marcel Proust, the elixir of memory might have been a petite madeleine*, but that wouldn't work on British-bred me. What I needed was a can of Heinz cream of mushroom soup and a packet of Sainsbury's cheese and onion crisps. As I gathered these and other long-neglected childhood foodstuffs from the supermarket shelves, I thought surely one sniff, one taste would be enough to take me right back. That's the stuff of nostalgia. We are sometimes surprised to discover the impact of old familiar things on our moods and emotions. The whiff of crackers from our childhood times can make us inexplicably misty-eyed with a longing that can also extend to places. A visit to a previously unknown, old family street corner or even an old cemetery can make us giddy or melancholic; walking along the sidewalk, we feel the dent of earlier footsteps, of histories and memories infused with our senses. Even if the memories provoked by smell and sight are not more vivid or specific, they are more emotional and evocative. There is therefore a difference between the statements ""òThat's exactly how I remember it' and ""òThat's exactly as it was'. Nostalgia thus goes beyond the dry recollection of historical details and retrieves the emotional essence of what has happened.
Today, we see how nostalgia interacts with events that governments find important. History, the interplay of happenings that helps us interpret events, allows for social and national consciousness necessary to resurrect flailing loyalties and perpetuate their narratives. Nation states hence need the ""òreality' that history brings to legitimise their existence. Nostalgia, however is the sweet savouring found in our collective past ""ì like bridges, monuments, open fields, shops or toys that bring us together, and enables our sweet memories where we once laughed, cried and more importantly, lived. A wise politician realises the need to marry the ""òfacts' of what we remember with the intimate and the familiar. Like it or not, nostalgia attends to us. It recognises the intense meanings we attach to home, childhood, family, ancestry and place. It breathes into our farewells and returns and soothes us in the weathering of our continuity and change, and our inevitable losses. After all, nostalgia is really a manifestation of our all-too-human predilection for longing ""ì more specifically, our longing for connection. Food therefore often forms a powerful part of the emotional narrative of our lives which is, in many ways, more important than the historical one. Immigrants will often adopt the language of their host nation, and even start thinking in it, but they will not give up the food traditions of the old country. This is precisely what nostalgia does as it preserves a link of where they came from, in order to keep a clear sense of who they still are. It is also possible that we carry a sense of memories of people and places we may not have known directly in our own lives. Photographs in an old album, even of strangers, evoke a familiar longing that compels me to look and look, and even as we inexplicably pine for the voices and stories behind every picture that we know we may never have a chance to hear, we revel in the imaginations they provoke ""ì a sensation that is as painful as it is pleasurable. That is why many of us now derive pleasure in popular forms of nostalgia, actively seeking out films, music, monuments and literature that allow us to swim in its waters; of course some of us work very hard to dry ourselves off and break free from what we see as crass and backward-looking sentimentality but today, filmmakers, retirees and even students have flocked to the altar of nostalgia, breathing, gawking and tasting every film, food and story offered by the subjects of their inner need to know their past.
Naturally, nostalgia has its critics. After all, nostalgia can enable us to see only the sunshine. Often, the recollections are borne from beautiful vintage photographs and wonderful fluffy memories where its dream-like state acts likes a narcotic, and we forget the need for the mundane and the constancy that it brings. At the same time, as the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard puts it, nostalgia also gently warps the picture we have of the past. It is easier to remember the bits of history where the hero won. It iseasier to think about beautiful dances and balls, and the sumptuous clothing that rich people wore, and ignore the social injustices and extreme conditions affecting the rest of the population. My father's love for all quaint British habits and architecture ignored the fact that a lot of that was built on the backs of people living in poverty and bondage. Often nostalgia excuses the sad historical detail that is often told by the winner of the day ""ì sweet but sometimes hardly objective. For sentimental old fools, nostalgia makes it easy to get lost in that achingly beautiful sadness. I would often, as a child, be practically paralysed with the thought of some beautiful thing I had experienced, or even some sad thing I had experienced. But living in that aching sadness means that you always feel that way ""ì and it is hard to be that emotional all the time. Hence, living in nostalgia can be a source of emotional turmoil and a catalyst for depression because our longings, anchored in the past assumes that we havenothing left to live for. Nostalgia often leaves us harking for a past that was painful as it was beautiful. In fact, it is downright exhausting.

"They generally argue that in times of economic hardship, this is unacceptable to governments to spend in arms and armed forces. However, in the face of Machiavellian threats, the security of a nation must remain preserved at all cost because it is the fundamental requirement to remain capable human stability so as to attain. But by removing the military, the workforce becomes available for construction and consignment.","Pacifists would claim that in times of economic hardship, it is unacceptable for governments to spend on arms and armed forces. This is a valid and logical stance since it is apparent that finite resources available should be used to ameliorate economic hardship. After all, it is the government's duty to guarantee a quality standard of living for its people. Moreover, in the relatively peaceful world we live in today where conflicts are merely reduced to skirmishes, excessive expenditure on arms seems moreirrelevant than ever. The government should therefore channel its funds and resources to invigorate the economy through a slew of financial reforms and market intervention. Ultimately, this would ensure that the state remains accountable to the electorate that had put them into power in the first place. Conversely, spending on arms and the armed forces in the advent of economic hardship would further compound the financial crisis, and several countries bear testimony to such an oversight. The Soviet Union experienced a series of famines and the depreciation of the ruble in the 1970s and 1980s. Then, Soviet citizens languished in the purgatory of economic hardship and struggled to obtain basic necessities, even more so when exorbitant price tags were placed on them in black markets.  Despite the glaring problems, the Soviet government continued to fund military programmes that developed the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and nuclear stockpile, and mired itself in the cash-burning arms race, even in space, to combat the US threat in the Cold War climate. Ultimately, it trapped the Soviet government in a vicious cycle of endless expenditure on arms that it could not step down from. As a result, this decision cost millions of lives and led to resistance against the regime which ultimately collapsed in 1991. Today, North Korea treads on the same unfortunate footsteps by pouring funds into nuclear development while its citizens are reduced to eating grass and tree barks. Evidently, economic concerns far outweigh the need to spend on arms and armed forces because it compounds economic woes and blatantly disregards the livelihood of its citizens and even their sanctity of lives. This moral hazard therefore renders expenditure on arms and armed forces unacceptable during economic crisis.
However, in the face of Machiavellian realpolitik today, the security of a nation must be guaranteed at all cost because it is the utmost priority to remain capable of defence so as to survive. Hence, economic hardship is merely a small problem that pales in comparison in the grand scheme of things. Ancient historian and war strategist Thucydides presciently warned centuries ago that ""the strong do what they can, the weak suffer what they must""ù. This quote epitomises the politics of survival in this cut-throat world. The ability to safeguard sovereignty is the basis of all progress in a country, hence to not spend on arms and armed forces at all times would be tantamount to removing the cornerstone of progress and prosperity. If the country does not even exist, what economic hardship will there be to speak of? This urgent need and justification for military expenditure is further augmented in small states like Singapore and Kuwait. In the nascent years of independence, Singapore mired in financial concerns as she lost her hinterland for exports. Yet even in the crisis ravaged era and region where all hopes of prosperity remained bleak, she set aside a significant amount of budget to develop a formidable armed force, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). For a country whose population was barely one percent of the US population, it seemed preposterous to splurge on the SAF. However, such dedication to financing a reliable armed force havepaid off as the SAF delivered 50 years of stability and ensured that Singapore retained her sovereignty despite being surrounded by much larger and more hostile neighbours. Conversely, Kuwait was invaded by Iraq in 1990 due to her contrasting focus on eradicating economic problems. Expenditure on arms and armed forces therefore greatly outweigh economic concerns because it is perhaps the only way to safely guarantee survival in a volatile world today. It would also be parochial to assume that economic hardship and the need to spend on arms and armed forces diametrically oppose each other. In fact, such expenditure can invigorate the economy and resolve the issue of economic hardship, therefore effectively killing two birds with one stone. It could beargued that such expenditure is justified as it turns a crisis into an opportunity. Spending on arms and armed forces can create employment opportunities, developing arms can demonstrate the ability to secure peace and therefore earn the trust of military alliances for more funds.
First, by developing the military, the workforce is mobilised for construction and conscription. In somecases, the development of arms can even invigorate downstream industries where a need for their basic materials fuels the supply and demand chain. A case in point would be Djibouti's construction of the naval base and naval force with the aid of Chinese military contractors. Hundreds and thousands of locals found themselves a source of stable income through the construction of the port and naval base, and country was actively mobilised in its energy and raw material sector to facilitate the construction, and as such, breathed life into the Djibouti economy that once mired in poverty. Second, military exports serve as a source of direct revenue. During the Second World War when the American economy was still recovering from the debilitating aftermath of the Great Depression, the United States invested extensively in its military sector and as a result, armoured vehicles, warships and light arms like M16 rifles were developed by the likes of Lockheed Martin and exported as revenue. This served as a cash cow to lift the U.S. out of the remnants of the Great Depression and prop the U.S. up as a world leader in economics after the war.

"It must also be conceded that in the most typical definition of fashion, basic fashion does not have much useful meaning other than aesthetic beauty at least because of its high cost and lack of creative logic. On another level it must also be acknowledged as a factor that globalization fostered a sense of consumerism, resulting in a waste in materials. In a more tangible aspect, the fashion industry brings capital to women around the globe, lifting many families out of poverty. ","It must first be conceded that the most typical idea of fashion ""haute coutureî does not have much real significance other than aesthetic beauty at times because of its high cost and lack of functionality. How many can afford the exorbitantly-priced floor-length dresses with plunging necklines or the d√©grad√© pleated tulle gowns hot off the runway from the House of Dior's latest Spring/Summer collection? Better yet, how many would want (or dare) to clad themselves in quirkily cut tops and uncomfortably tight wrap skirts even if they were produced by Italy's top designers? These types of fashion are highly impractical and unaffordable, especially for the middle-class and lower-income class of the population, who would rather go to work in comfortable, practicalclothing rather than stand out like a sore thumb while suffocating from the discomfort simultaneously. Paired with uncomfortable climate conditions such as the intense humidity and heat in Singapore, such garments are all the more out of the question. In this sense, this ""haute couture"" type of fashion serves no real value as it is both impractical and expensive, and therefore not applicable to a majority of society.
On deeper analysis, it should also be acknowledged as a fact that fashion fosters a sense of consumerism, resulting in a waste of resources. Fashionistas, both the elite and mainstream alike, are constantly hopping from trend to trend and dressing according to the latest fads in order to seem 'cool' and 'trendy', a form of flaunting of their supposed social status. These ephemeral, fleeting trends often result in a massive wastage of clothing and resources. Studies have revealed that several million tonnes of relatively new,functional clothing are discarded or donated (more of the former than the latter) every year. It does not help that popular fashion labels are feeding this fashion frenzy in an attempt to keep their clothes lines fresh and entice people to purchase more""îH&M introduces hundreds of new outfits every week, promptly disposing of older designs. This throw-away culture perpetuated by society and firms not only erodes the valued principles of prudency and thriftiness, but also promotes materialism and places a strain on resources like cotton which could have been devoted to other industries which directly improve society's welfare. Hence, seeing as how fashion encourages consumerism and wastes resources, both detrimental for society, fashion may once again appear to lack real purpose. However, to simply write off fashion as useless based on the above arguments would be a benighted oversight of the benefits fashion brings to society, in both tangible and intangible aspects. To begin with, fashion is a powerful instrument in making statements that express certain causes or beliefs, especially when the appropriate attire is selected. People, first and foremost, perceive others to be of a certain personality or the like based on their clothes, as supported by countlessresearch. Fashion is expression on the individual level and collective level. In the social arena, large groups of people often garb themselves in the same collective attire to make a stand for particular social causes they believe in. Take for instance the Pink Dot Movement in Singapore, where thousands gather en masse in pink-coloured clothing to show their support for the LGBT community and ensure that these individuals do not feel left out or socially ostracised in a relatively more conservative society. This social statement is one of such great impact that even tourist participate in it to express their support as a collective body. With meaningful social statements like these made possible through fashion, how could one possibly  argue that it serves no real value? 
In a more tangible aspect, the fashion industry provides employment to millions across the globe, lifting many out of poverty. It is no head-turning fact that the fashion industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry, what with countless designer brands and labels as well as multi-national retail chains around the world today.Italy, home to renowned brands like Dolce & Gabbana, has a fashion industry worth 83.6 billion Euros. Many of these major fashion labels often require massive amount of manpower due to the sheer amount of clothing churned out by mass production every year. Less developed countries also benefit as some of the work is outsourced to them, allowing numerous individuals to be lifted out of unemployment as these jobs typically only require low skill levels. This directly impacts large numbers of people globally who have benefitted from the employment opportunities provided by the fashion industry and now have higher standards of living. Moreover, fashion has also taken up the mantle in protecting the dying breed of artisans by providing them with jobs.Designers travel to places like South Africa to employ the locals there to create intricate handmade crafts and to South Asia to tap on the centuries-old techniques in hand""ìdyed fabric. The employment provided not only allows these minority artisans to put food on table, but also brings the beauty of their technique and craft to an international stage, where many more will be able to value and appreciate their culture and skills, giving new meaning to their craft.

"Due to the recent rise in frequency and incidents of fake news, first brought into light in our 2016 US presidential campaign many news organizations have placed an increased focus on the factual accuracy of what outlets report. Political context is of key interest in deciding if a publication that presents accurate news reports may hence be relied upon, in terms of relative amount of a state actor present in the society. The same should also be applied for objectives of any news media: aside from editorial purposes, presenting and reporting on the truths oft therein. ","Due to the apparent rise in frequency and incidents of fake news, as brought to light during the 2016 US presidential election, many media outlets have placed an increased emphasis on the factual accuracy of what they report. This is true of some of the established media outlets worldwide, including countries suchas Germany, where concerns about the honesty of the media was questioned after some news outlets reported the occurrence of a violent incident happening on New Year's Eve when there was none. In response to readers' heightened awareness of the questionable veracity of whatever the media presents due to events such as the above, however, established news outlets have taken the initiative to become more reliable sources. For example, in the context of Germany, even news outlets with rather dubious reputations ""ì such as that of a local tabloid known for its salacious reporting and penchant forsensationalising ""ì have publicly vouched to maintain journalistic integrity in its subsequent issues. To that end, some of these outlets are working with homegrown organisations such as Correctiv (based in Germany) to confirm the factual accuracy of the stories they publish. This is thus reflective of a concerted effort to present truthful media coverage despite mistakes previous made, and suggests that they will maintain a  sufficient level of truth to be relied upon in times to come. However, today's world of journalism, due to political, social or economic incentives or problems, there are many occasions in which the information presented might not be wholly true. To this end, news from the media should thus be taken with a pinch of salt, with the level of trust inthe media being accorded to it by the reader in terms of the context whereby the journalist wrote a particular article, or even the country from which the news outlet in question has its headquarters.
Political context is of key relevance in ascertaining if a media outlet presents truthful news and can hence be relied upon, in terms of the amount of a state control present in the society. In authoritarian regimes, or even democraciesless liberal in nature, the media can end up being a mere mouthpiece of the government that fails to act as an effective fourth estate by omitting reports on any, for instance, results from a failed policy that might reflect poorly on the government. This is the concern that many human rights watch officials have about the situation in countries as Russia, China, and increasingly, Turkey. In Turkey, the shuttering of popular newspapers such as Zaman, and the replacement of its original office of editors with one of Erdogan's office's own choosing led to the newspaper's complete reversal in stance from critical to very supportive of the current government, with articles that gloss over any views perceived to be dissident in nature. Of course, this can be taken to new extremes when it comes to countries such as North Korea, where any mediacoverage may be completely false, and presented simply to further the interests of the government. Fortunately, even if the trend is worrying, many countries today still have relatively better levels of freedom of the press. However, it is nonetheless a factor to be considered as a reason why some media should not be taken at face-value.
The same can also be said for objectives of alternative news media outlets aside from journalistic purposes of presenting and reporting on the truths oftoday's world. Especially pertinent in today's age is the financial incentive that comes with higher ratings. Due to the saturation of the news and media industry, rival firms have taken to increasingly sensationalised, exaggerated or even utterly fake news with zero factual accuracy in order to generate revenue. A rather infamous, yet recent example would be the decision of Fox News to post an article on the death of a Democratic politician who belonged to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), who the article accused of having leaked inside information about Clinton and other DNC members during the election season to WikiLeaks, rather than attributing it to Russian hackers. Not one to be one-upped, other far right news sources soon put up articles boldly headlined with titles along the lines of ""Information leak an insidejob, not by Russians!""ù, which generated much readership due to their controversial nature. The crux of the issue is that all of this was done with any fact-checking on the truth of the matter, in which these turned out to be baseless accusations. It can thus be seen that sometimes, the tendency of larger-than-life stories to be popular and the wishes of some media outlets to exploit this causes them to present fake news that should not be fully relied upon. This is especially true for media that tends to be very extreme in its bias, whether on partisan, ethnic or gender lines, and should be considered when evaluating the reliability of some media.

"Critics to the idea would point out the innate insecurity of urban living, or as per result, cities, as reasons for why it was impossible. Additionally, others hold a point of view that outdoor living, with challenges does not even allow you a recharge of nature in its truest form. However, also seems that most of the factors that lead people who condemn the idea of co-existing stem from the fact that modern cities have seemingly tried to overcome, not work, the forces of nature. ","Critics of the idea often point to the innate characteristics of urban living, and as a result, cities, as reasons for why coexistence is impossible. Urban living is associated with a high population density style of living, surrounded by others, and with a focus on jobs away from the primary sector of resource extraction,which includes industries like agriculture. Urban living tends to require a greater consumption of resources from nature than rural environments, as people often drive and electricity is being used in huge amounts thanks to giant shopping mallsor billboards, among other reasons. The same critics like to say that it is inevitable for there to be a clash between humans and nature in the urban context, especially as the cities today are continually having to expand to caterto influxes of people. It is true that urban living often results in the concretisation of lands, with green spaces bulldozed in favour of roads, or in a notable case in Singapore, a prospective MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) line. Even though issues of preserving the nature that has sat at the Central Catchment Reserve, in the very heart of the city, arose, the final decision was that merely an environmental risk assessment would be carried out, rather than a cessation of the project. Thisclearly seems to denote that ultimately, the needs of the urban population will outweigh the benefits of nature, forcing nature out of the urban context.
Additionally, others raise the point of view that urban living, with highly planned not even allow for the existence of nature in its truest form. In this case, nature is regarded to be ""òwild', free from human touch or interaction. Therefore, the truly ""òwild' nature cannot co-exist, or even exist, in urban living situations. This line of argument does hold water, as we look to the situations of urban life in cities today. Given that people travel all over the city, the parts of nature that are a threat to human safety surely cannot co-exist in a city. If a tiger were to suddenly appear and walk through the streets of London, it would certainly spark panic, and there would be a threat not only to the humans, but also to the tiger, as people could shoot at or hurt it in their panic. Hence, an attempt to co-exist with the more dangerous forms of naturecould cause harm to befall both those engaged in urban living and nature itself. While it is unlikely to see a tiger in modern cities today, there are plenty ofother initially unassuming creatures or plants that are dangerous to humans. Urban living thus cannot co-exist with a truly wild nature, because it would require fundamental shifts in the way we live, to the point where characteristics of urban living could be lost. Another example to bring up would be the thousands of skyscraper buildings, a relatively modern construction, in cities worldwide, which have sprung up due to the urban lifestyle that requires many to live in apartments and small houses instead of mansions, for reasons of space and money. These skyscrapers pose a danger to many of the animals in nature, and we see this manifested in how thousands of birds are reported each year as having slammed into the glass windows of these structures, having been unable to distinguish them as hazards. So, we see why many claim that urban living and nature cannot co-exist.
However, it seems that many of these issues that lead critics to condemn the idea of coexistence stem from the fact that modern cities have often tried to overcome, not work with, the forces of nature. Instead of considering ways forurban living that incorporate or integrate with nature, many efforts to improve and build cities and urban living tend to work against, or without regard for, nature, and this can generate the impression that urban living and nature are at odds, when they do not have to be. Take Singapore's Kallang-Bishan floodway as an example. It was originally a river, before it was channelized and concretisedinto a straight drain for the purposes of stormwater runoff. This did alleviate the issue of flooding that had plagued the area, and served as a boon for some to claim that nature had to be conquered for the urban dwellers in the area to continue living well. However, this was only a stop-gap measure, and in years where nature's forces resulted in heavier precipitation, the channel overflowed and inundated some of the houses anyway. This led the Singapore government to try and change the way they were approaching the issue, leading to the destruction of the concrete man-made channel, back to a gently meandering river, with wildlife and vegetation. Now, the area serves as an extremely effective catchment area and floodplain, nature taking the water that the asphalt roads and bricked pavements cannot handle. This is an exemplary ideal of coexistence, where nature acts to preserve the urban living concept by protecting the houses and urban dwellers when it is given the chance and worked with, instead of against. This is not the only case, as the destruction of dams near cities in the U.S. and Latin America have also shown that cities and those living in them can benefit when working in tandem and co-existing with nature. Hence, coexistence between urban living and nature is definitely possible, and may beeven more so in modern cities, where technological advancement has made it possible to engineer effective solutions like the aforementioned turning of the channel of concrete back into a sustainable river through creative engineering.

"Another reason that city living with tourism can, or indeed should, co-exist is the increasing acceptance by tourism making a contribution to urban living, due to recent scientific progress showing its benefits. Obviously the concept of inheritance implies that there is some sort of give and take involved in the process. To conclude, while the initial reaction of many may be to dismiss any idea of nature being able to co-exist with urban living, and the latter may have a point of successful contention when the nature in question cannot live together without certain other characteristics of city living, we simply say co-existence is either impossible or cannot be done. ","Another reason that urban living and nature can, and indeed should, co-exist is the increasing acceptance of nature as a necessity to good living, due to recent scientific progress showing its benefits. Urban living no longer excludes nature, but has seen a shift towards its inclusion instead. In many modern cities, the ideaof urban living has often grown to include the provision of green spaces for leisure and recreation, and in light of that, it may be becoming increasinglypossible for them to co-exist in the cities of today as mindsets change to accommodate. This shift can be seen in a range of cities worldwide, though it has been less recent for some. Many Scandinavian countries, including Norway and Sweden, have sought to increase the greenery and nature in their cities through schemes and policies that encourage planners to ensure that every person in the city has access to a green space in their neighbourhood. Singapore too, seeks this, with a goal of 80% of the population to be living within 1km of a green space. It is a phenomenon even present in developing countries like Indiaor Brazil, both of which have implemented urban planning that accounts for green spaces in their cities today. Therefore, as mindsets and ideas of what constitute urban living change, especially important in today's context as studies show that exposure to greenery and nature has health benefits, the possibility of coexistence between urban living and nature is set to increase.
Finally, the idea of coexistence implies that there is some form of give and take involved in the process. While parts of nature may be difficult to reconcile with the concept of urban living, others are less so. Urban living is regarded by many to mean a lifestyle centred in the city, with traits such as convenience and a fastpace. These characteristics are not, in fact, at odds to certain aspects of nature, especially if the existence of said nature brings benefit to those leading urban lifestyles. Keeping an herb garden or beehive, as is allowed in the state of New York in the United States, can actually be beneficial to the urban dwellers. In fact, since these types of cultivation do not need much space, which tends to be scarce in modern cities, and additionally, can provide a source of income or eliminate the need to purchase certain goods, which may reduce the costs of living that are generally very high in most modern cities, they might actually be a complement and advantage in tackling urban living and its associated problems, rather than something to be eradicated or avoided. Hence, nature may not be at odds to urban living, provided that the subset of nature involved fits nicely into the existing characteristics that define urban living, like convenience or high population densities, and the ability to co-exist may be greater if people are more aware of this.
To conclude, while the initial response of many may be to dismiss the idea of nature being able to co-exist with urban living, and the sentiment does have a point of successful contention when the nature in question cannot exist together with the other characteristics of urban living, we cannot say coexistence is entirely impossible and cannot be done. Rather, there are many ways for nature and urban living to successfully co-exist, especially in today's world of advancing technology and changing mindsets, provided that effort is made to ensure that they are complementarily implemented, instead of at odds.

"Over recent decades environmental damage and pollution issues have increasingly become more visible. However, in today's world, rapid development of technology have allowed even those living in cities to fully incorporate natural practices in personal lifestyles, blending nature with modern living. Moreover, in a highly competitive world, physical stress testing has given opportunities for nature to play a recreational role within the lives of city dwellers. ","In recent years, environmental degradation and pollution issues have increasingly become more pressing. We have seen widespread destruction of nature to giveway to the development of urban areas we live in today. As the world's population increases further, together with the increase in the proportion of people living in cities, there is cause for concern on whether nature will further be impacted in the future. At first glance, in the modern cities that we live in today, it may seem that nature is a necessary trade-off to the energy-intensive urban lifestyle. However, I believe that it is possible for nature and urban living to coexist in these cities today, as not only have improvements in technology helped us integrate eco-friendly features into our daily life, nature has also evolved to be an integral part of many urban dwellers' lifestyles. Granted, as people in modern cities become increasingly affluent in recent times, urban lifestyles have also become more energy-intensive, harming our natural environment. The age of globalisation has allowed for unrestricted movements of people and goods, facilitating global trade and economic growth. The bulk of this growth benefits those living in cities, particularly those who usually work in higher value-added industries such as service or research. Thus, we can see many of these cities growing at unprecedented rates, especially cities like Shanghai which were previously less developed. As such, there is a growing proportion of people in the middle-income group who have greater purchasing power and desire to consume more goods in their urban lifestyles. 4For instance, Beijing hasseen a boom in the number of vehicles on the road as many move towards ownership of their own private vehicles for transport. This causes problems,especially for the environment. As the number of cars increase, together with congestion issues due to the lack of supporting road infrastructure, the air in Beijing has worsened and seen increasing bouts of severe pollution. The air quality in Beijing has deteriorated to dangerous levels, part of which has been contributed by the problem of excessive road usage. On a more general scale, increased consumption by households require increased manufacturing and demands, further contributing to carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Thus, we cansee that as people have higher incomes, nature suffers as a result of increased consumption by households require manufacturing and production to meet these demands, further contributing to carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Thus we can see that as  people have higher incomes, nature suffers as a result of increased consumption, showing that there is indeed a trade-off between nature and urban living especially in the world today.
However, in today's world, the development of technology has allowed for those living in cities to incorporate environmental-friendly practices in their lifestyles,integrating nature into modern living. In recent years, there have been developments in technology which have not only increased the energy efficiencyof machines, but also reduced their costs as well. Home appliances, including fridges, televisions and air-conditioning units, have since added eco-features, such as Panasonic's air-conditioners which use intelligent sensors to monitor room conditions to minimise energy consumption. Lowered prices have reduced cost barriers of such products, making them more price competitive with traditional models. This has facilitated more and more people to adopt them instead, building eco-friendly initiatives into their lives. Another example would be electric and hybrid vehicles, which have seen prices go down due to improvements in battery technology. Although currently, these cars may still not be widely adopted due to other factors like fuel ranges or accessibility of supporting infrastructure, the increasing trend of people buying cards like the Toyota Prius paint an optimistic outlook for such eco-friendly features in daily transport. Thus, we can see that, in many cities today, improvements in technology have made it much easier for the individual to contribute to nature in their lifestyles, reducing their harmful impact on the environment. It acts as a mitigating factor against current trends such as carbon dioxide emissions andglobal warming, showing that caring for nature can indeed coexist with an urban lifestyle today.
Moreover, in today's highly competitive world, increasing stress levels have given an opportunity for nature to play a recreational role in the lives of city dwellers. As the world becomes more competitive especially due to competition from foreign countries, many workers and students experience increasing stress levels to edge out over their rivals. Such stress often leads to negative impacts onpsychological health and well-being if left unattended to. Thus, many people living in cities often seek ways to relieve the stress from work, through engaging in recreational activities. In many countries, nature then plays a huge role in providing a way for people to calm their mind and take a break away from the high-rise urban landscape. Nature, as a form of recreation, has become an integral part of urban living for many. For example, in New York City, many would visit the Central Park to have a  a stroll or hang out with their peers due to  its scenic nature away from the buzz in the city. This is prevalent in other major cities too, such as London with Hyde Park or Singapore with multiple parks and nature reserves spread across the country. There are other ways of engaging with nature too. For instance, there is a growing trend of people engaging in urban farming, where they can engage in recreational gardening in empty plots of land in the city like on rooftop gardens. Thus, we can see that nature has grown to coexist with urban lifestyles, by providing a means of recreation and relaxation in the stressful world we live in today.

"Some may think that there are no people that are capable enough to make bold decisions to assist their country and the international community navigate through difficult times. However, the figures so capable are rapidly becoming the minority today. In addition, in today's dynamic world, many are wary of trying to solve complex issues within their culture and in the international system.","Some may argue that there are some politicians who are capable enough to make bold moves to help their country and the international community navigate through difficult situations. These leaders are unfazed by the many crises facing the world today and are able to make sound decisions that help to alleviate these issues. For example, when faced with the serious humanitarian crisis that is the Syrian refugee crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel madethe bold decision to open Germany's borders to these refugees who were fleeing the devastating war in Syria. This greatly helped to reduce the number of refugees that were fleeing their country and could not find a new home, helping to alleviate a serious crisis. In addition, her decision set an example forother countries to follow, encouraging other neighbouring countries to accept more refugees as well. Accepting a large number of refugees with different backgrounds and cultures into a country and helping them to integrateundoubtedly posed a large logistic challenge and put a great strain on a country's budget and hence only a capable leader would be willing to take such a bold step and be able to manage the situation well. This shows that even in the light of the increasingly serious and difficult crises facing the international community today, there are some leaders who are willing and are capable enough to take bold steps to alleviate seemingly insurmountable crises.
However, political leaders so capable are seemingly becoming the minority today. In an attempt to gain power, many politicians are taking the easy route out ""ì refusing to face global problems head on and instead pandering to popular sentiments within a country. In many Western countries today, politicians are sticking their head inthe sand, refusing to acknowledge global issues and promising to close off their country to the outside world. One of the more high profile incidents was the United Kingdom's vote to exit the European Union, also known as Brexit. Politicians such as Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage capitalised on the British people's fear of immigrants and refugees, choosing to ignore the growing crisis just outside their borders and going with the popular sentiment to close the country's borders and stop the flow of immigrants and refugees into the U.K. These politicians do not want to face the growing refugee crisis, trying to win people over using popular sentiments instead, showing that they are incapable of not only dealing effectively with aserious crisis, but also winning voters over with tangible and feasible policies to improve their lives. The pro-Brexit politicians managed to push their agendathrough, which may lead to undesirable consequences to people outside and within the U.K. Such politicians who are incapable of facing the numerous issues facing the global community today are not unique to the U.K. They gain power by pushing populist, protectionist policies that are unsustainable in the long run, showing that in a time where international cooperation and aid are required, there are politicians who are seemingly incapable of stepping up to the plate.
In addition, in today's hyper-partisan world, politicians are incapable of cooperating to solve serious issues within their country and within the international community. Instead, these leaders choose to place more emphasis on their party's agenda than on the betterment of a country's citizens. Crucial issues like healthcare and government budget are being used to push partisan goals, and as a result have less chance of getting passed into law. This results in citizens suffering from inadequate government aid in crucial areas such as healthcare and infrastructure. For example, politicians in the United States Congress are sharply divided along party lines, and do not cooperate to pass bills that are beneficial to its citizens. Americans pay the highest amount for healthcare in the world, and yet it took 45 years before a comprehensive healthcare bill was signed into law by President Obama. Politicians from the opposition party refused to support the bill, and employed strategies like filibustering to prevent the passage of the bill. This eventually led to a shutdown of the U.S. government, as Congress could not pass a government budget that funds Obamacare. The shutdown led to other consequences such as government employees having to work without receiving a salary. Evidently, despite the fact that the American people were facing serious issues such as a poor healthcare system, U.S. politicians were incapable of seeing the bigger picture and could only focus on  petty partisan politics, resulting in theAmerican people having to suffer from insufficient government aid. Such shortsighted politicians are detrimental to the well-being and satisfaction of a country's citizens, and are definitely not up to the job.

In more contemporary terms, even though scientists have not found an absolute cure to cancer yet, they have been able to develop treatments for previously deemed fatal forms of brain cancers, saving lives that would otherwise be doomed to a fatal end. Indeed, scientific advancement is undeniably a powerfulforce that propels tremendous improvements to our quality of life. This is made possible by the methodical and logical process of the scientific method, that allows us to identify the root causes of problems and effectively target them. As science allows us to deepen our understanding of the workings of the world in a highly logical and systematic manner, we are able to pinpoint underlying issues and correct what have gone wrong. For instance, the madcow disease that struck livestock and people who consumed the diseased cows remained rampant in its initial stages as people were unable to identify the vector of transmission. Without a clear understanding of the problem, people were helpless to prevent the spread of the disease. Through scientific research, the culprit was identified to be prions, and with that, doctors were able to provide a proper diagnosis and contain the spread of the virus. The ability of science to facilitate problem solving in this manner makes it undeniably one of the biggest forces for change and solving our problems.
Science and technology also seems promising in solving our problems despite some of its creations leading to environmental and health problems as it seemingly provides solutions to the problems it has caused. The golden age of scientific advancements in the 1920s that spanned for decades led to the invention and subsequent widespread use of machines such as fuel-driven cars and machinery for mass manufacturing. This propelled transportation to the next level and sated our desire for material goods. Years later, we now feel its detrimental effects: high carbon emissions from an overpopulation of cars as well as from a booming manufacturing industry that boasted rows of factories dutifully puffing out greenhouse gases. This has led to a rapid rise in global average temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. In China, where the manufacturing industry is still thriving, levels of smog have risen so high that in city areas like Beijing, doctors have seen a significant rise in lung cancer cases. Yet, all is not lost, for green technology is rising in popularity and promises to reverse the damage done. Many green innovations have emerged such as Tesla's electric cars, that guarantees zero carbon foot print. Not only that, solar and hydroelectric power are all alternative sources of energy that have shown tangible potential to be able to replace environmentally detrimental practices of using fuel energy. In this way, even though scientific advancements have created new problems in its place, there seems to be still a glimmer of hope that science and technology can be the answer to our problems.
Yet, one alarming trend we see is that many of such innovations do not end up being actively utilised to solve the problems they claim to solve. Hence the ideal that science and technology can singlehandedly solve our problems border on delusion, as many other human factors come into play for it to effectively solve the problems we face. For instance, the aforementionedsources of renewable energy have shown the promise of entirely replacing our current sources of petroleum oil, natural gas and coal. Yet, bureaucracies and power struggles have impeded the implementation of such  solutions: oil remains a valuable trade commodity and the OPEC participant countries continues to ensure that it is so. Furthermore, the US has also recently discovered new shale oil fields that sent oil prices further tumbling down. With oil prices remaining low, it is hard for the relevant industries to turn to greener renewable energy as they may lose their competitiveness by incurring higher cost. If we remain blind to other such limiting factors and do not target them, we will only end up developing more solutions, that sometimes lead to more problems, without ever solving the issue in question. Since the development of hydroelectric power, more dangerous sources of energy like nuclear energy have been developed, which brings with it the threat of radiation poisoning as a trade-off for zero pollution. Hence, it would be myopic to suggest that science and technology can be the solution to problems when there is a multitude of other factors that need to be addressed.

"Many find that offering financial or material aid does not always result in something bad that good when it is used to hide the causes or the crime in hand. But this is not usually the case. Providing assistance to countries in need can also potentially be counter-productive when aid reinforces the problems rather than solutions, thus causing greater harm than good. ","Many argue that offering financial or material aid does not always result in more harm than good when it is used to address root causes of the problem at hand. When the issue faced by the country is studied and analysed at depth by relevant authorities, before channeling funds meticulously and efficiently into the appropriate industries or policies that can benefit the country, aid does more good than harm. In Botswana, foreign aid that was received to help the country climb over the poverty line was managed skillfully by the government, which used it to fund its renewed education measures and healthcare system. In such cases of stringent care taken to ensure aid is distributed well, less harm is done as the finances are effective in targeting the root cause of the problem of poverty. With better education and more affordable healthcare, the workforce is more likely to be skilled and productive, in turn reaping economic growth that benefits the country in need. In this way, efficient management of financial aid is much less likely to bring about harm than good. 
However, this is not always the case. In most situations, providing financial aid indeed does more harm than good to countries when the funds are misused by authorities for selfish causes, leading to a further perpetuation of socio-economic inequalities. Given that most countries that receive financial aid are often developing nations that may not always be ruled by fiar or just leaders, money sent to such countries with the intention of improving existing economic crises often ends up in the hands of corrupt politicians. As a result, the finances may not be invested into policymaking that helps the country; rather, they are pocketed by nation leaders. Uganda, Zambia and Sierra Leone are part of a long list of African nations whose leaders earned millions out of mishandling incoming foreign aid. The unaccountability of the political systems in these developing countries, coupled with the lack of transparency in the process of transferring aid, which leads to aid not reaching the correct beneficiaries, could lead to rich politicians and officers of higher ranks getting richer while the poor continue to struggle. Hence, foreign aid widens the socio-economic gap between the rich minority and the poor majority in developing countries, thus doing more harm than good.
Providing aid to countries in need could also potentially be counter-productive when it aggravates existing problems rather than ameliorating them, thus causing more harm than good. One such instance is the Rohingya Refugee Crisis, which recently led the Bangladeshi government to place a request for all incoming foreign aid to be halted. This was due to the influx of aid into Bangladesh encouraging refugees from Rakhine to cross borders illegally. In this case, foreign aid, although intended to provide assistance to the host country on a humanitarian basis, proved to defeat its own purpose as it gave the green light for more refugees to enter it. This only worsened the problem of overcrowding and abysmal living conditions at the borders of Bangladesh and Myanmar. The material aid could have been used and managed efficiently to mitigate the adverse effects of the sudden inflow of refugees, thus having potential to do good for the receiving nation. However, this was outweighed by the detrimental fact that the provision of aid sent the Rohingya positive signals about the living conditions in Bangladesh, hence rendering foreign aid more harmful and counterproductive than useful.

"Now, some might ask ""why can an axiom just be rejected?"" to which the answer is ""why not?"" As such there is no implication to this statement when two very similar statements can be true at the same time. Apart for this applicability of math in general this model of where truths can be found using a set of simple assumptions has many potential applications for science. ","Now, some might ask ""why can an axiom just be rejected?""ù to which the answer is ""why not?""ù This practice is perfectly coherent with math being just a game. Indeed, if on the basis of some other power or reason, such as logic, some axioms definitely needed to be true, then we could not just reject our axioms as and when we like (at least not how we could do so within a game). But in math, we do reject axioms from time to time ""ì indeed completely new fields are often discovered from relaxing an assumption of the existing field. Consider again the creation of irrational numbers. To some Greeks, these numbers are evil, they could not be written as the ratio of 2 normal numbers. Eventually the world just accepted the use of those ""weird, evil""ù numbers and moved on. Similarly, some of us find it difficult to accept that axioms can be revised and lead to the creation of new systems ""ì but this is just a fact of math that makes most sense when we consider math to be just a game played according to deductive rules that we imposed upon it.
As always, there is an implication to this ""ì that two seemingly contradictory statements can be true at the same time. ""The sum of interior angles of a triangle is 180¬∞""ù and ""the sum of interior angles of a triangle is 270¬∞""ù are statements that are equally true ""ì even if they seem contradictory. We all know that ~[P^~P], but isn't the above a clear example of this? The first statement can be proven in Euclidean geometry, and the second in spherical geometry. How can this be? Perhaps a real world illustration would make it simpler ""ì the former is true when your triangle is flat (on a plane) while the latter is true if your triangle is constructed on a sphere. The mistake is to say that both are triangles and so should have the same angle sum. They are fundamentally different because they are construed in different axiomatic systems, with different interpretations in the real world. Within an axiomatic system, the principle of non-contradiction certainly holds, but we must be careful to note that a mathematical object's properties can only be understood within the context of the axiomatic theory itself. Another, perhaps more mind-boggling example, is to consider ""what is 1+2+3+4+""¶""ù We would normally say that the sum is infinity, but mathematicians say that under certain assumptions (i.e. if you are in the right axiomatic system), the answer could be -1/12. Both axioms are equally valid, they just have different fundamental axiomatic interpretations of what a ""sum""ù is. This does seem to show that math is meaningless however, no statement can be true everywhere, only within an axiomatic system. Doesn't this make math meaningless? If I can't know what 1+1 is, then what am I wasting my life on? The answer to this is that we can know the truth of certain axioms, just within a system itself. Math still has lots of meaning ""ì it shows all the truths that necessarily follow from a set of simple axioms. 5 simple axioms and I can deduce all the truths about geometry in a plane. 
Apart from this applicability of math in itself, this idea of how truths can be deduced from a set of simple assumptions has many practical applications in science. For instance, if I assume that in a key step of a chemical reaction, there is only 1 reactant molecule, then the rules of math allow me to deduce how the concentrations of reactant and product change over time. This assumption has no mathematical basis, but once I assume it, I can predict so many properties of my system. It is rather akin to math itself ""ì the axioms have no real reason for being true, but once I assume them there is a whole world of knowledge waiting to be discovered. This defining feature of math appears time and again in science ""ì how can one then say that math is meaningless?

"And it is highly likely that the kind of negative repercussions they cause can easily flood out to neighboring countries, especially in view of an increasing interconnectedness of economies and world affairs of today. Some nations often intervene in ways it feel is the best way, but fail to fully realise how their method often fails to yield fruits and is hence unwarranted. Moreover, however financial aid normally trickles down to the poorest to provide temporary relief, it does not solve underlying underlying causes of crisis.","Moreover, it is highly possible that the sea of negative repercussions they experience can easily flood over to other countries, especially in view of the increasing interconnectedness of economies and socio-political affairs of countries. By virtue of safeguarding their own natural welfare and existence, some argue that it is hence necessary for countries to intervene in others' problems. However, I believe that based on interventionist actions adopted by many countries historically, it is regrettably to conclude that many simply use ""intervention""ù as a false pretext for their own hegemonic ambitions, often at the expense of the nations they attempt to interfere with, making such intervention largely unjustified. In all honesty, if Kuwait was not of strategic use to the US and her Middle-Eastern allies, would they have intervened at all? Probably not. Would Kuwait have been left to her condemned fate under Saddam Hussein's regime? Quite possibly. Sadly, global politics tends to follow realpolitik, where actions taken by nations are largely underpinned by pragmatism and the need to protect national self-interests, even if that means bringing harm unto another. Time and again, we have witnessed how nations intervene in another's affairs, only to let them burn to the ground when they are no longer of any significance. Fast-forward a decade from the Kuwaiti invasion, and we have the US invasion of Saddam's Iraq, this time under the pretext of Iraq owning chemical weapons and employing them against civilians. But when the invasion ended, no weapons were ever found, and many international theorists believe that the true intention of the American invasion was to safeguard oil in the Middle East, while the official line of chemical weapons was merely a duplicitous pretext. Furthermore, after ousting Saddam, the US military quickly withdrew its forces, leaving a power vacuum that caused a power struggle that swept the nation like a hurricane. Sectarian violence between the Sunnis and Shiites ensued, and this eventually led to the rise of extremist group ISIS. One would question, then: What good ever came out of that invasion besides fulfilling the US' own self-pursuits? In fact, it is all the more insidious that ""foreign intervention""ù is used as a tool by power-hungry nations to masquerade their selfish agendas as justified and democratic, at the expense of the host country's welfare. Clearly, foreign intervention in such scenarios is highly undesirable.
Furthermore, nations often intervene in what they feel is the best way possible, but fail to realise that their method often fails to bear fruit and is hence unwarranted. For example, when nations intervene by providing aid to other countries, it often comes in the form of monetary and food aid, but these are often short-term solutions that fail to create sustainable solutions. The 2002 Monterrey Consensus, for instance, witnessed the developed world pledging to allocate 0.7% of its GNP to the Third World. Every year since, billions of dollars have been donated to African states, but most of the aid fails to reach the needy, because they end up lining the pockets of corrupt rulers. 
Moreover, however much aid eventually trickles down to the people often provide temporary relief, it does not solve the root cause of poverty. Low-skilled, uneducated labour, poor economic infrastructure, and corrupt political system are factors that have continued to plague these nations and perpetuate foreign countries who intervene should aim to providing only monetary and resource aid, they not only with skills to propel themselves out of their destitute plight, but also exacerbate the situation by creating a cycle of dependency on aid. Instead, nations have to realise that the right way to intervene is to provide social reform initiatives and economic restructuring guidance to lift countries out of their tragic state. But of course, most countries remain indifferent to this, providing aid simply to fulfil their moral obligations but not actually concerned with how their aid will benefit the people in the long run. It is this apathy and ignorance that causes countries to adopt incontrovertibly facile solutions in an attempt to solve infinitely more complex problems, and this is what makes their ""intervention""ù so futile and unnecessary. To aggravate the situation, some countries even adopt policies that will jeopardise any benefits that their aid has provided. For example, the US donates about USD 32 billion a year to African states, but concurrently adopts protectionist measures by imposing high tariffs on African agricultural imports to protect local farmers, which is estimated to cost the African agricultural industry about USD 50 billion, more than the worth of aid provided. Sadly, when push comes to shove and a conflict of interest arises, nations will ultimately choose to protect themselves, rendering such aid ineffective.

"Citizenship is in essence linked to elections and the actions of political leaders are regularly used as a touch stone of how a country is governed. By listening to the different views of the public political leaders can be better aware of the people's needs and desires, thus designing their policies to the best interests of society. For instance, Shinzo Abe's decision to revise Article 9 of Japan's Constitution has generated growing anger and frustration among ordinary Japanese. Public opinion also serves as a check and balance against state leaders, preventing in efficiencies in governance and corruption from growing rampant. In states that are politically aware, the public often keeps up to date with the government's actions or keeps the look out for any signs and in efficiency that may engender a sudden downfall. ","Politics is inextricably linked to governance, and the actions of political leaders are often regarded as the touchstone of how a country is run. Public opinion on the other hand, plays a subtler yet indisputably important role as well. The different degrees to which political leaders take into account public opinion give rise to the various forms of governance that have existed and still exist in today's society, For instance, authoritarian figures are the result of a complete disregard for public opinion, while democracies shape their governance according to the opinions of the public. However, each type of government has its own distinct set of limitations and flaws, as well as strengths. While political leaders could ignore public opinion because popular views may not be in the best interest of the country, and can result in the marginalisation of the minority, I am still of the opinion that political leaders should be open to hearing their people's views. This is because public opinion acts as a check and balance against governmental inefficiencies and corruption, allows the government to implement laws for the benefit of the people, and prevents the rise of authoritarian regimes_ it is important to bear in mind the primary role of political leaders, which is to do what is best for the people. Thus, public opinion and the influence it has on political leaders should not always be mutually exclusive.
By listening to the views of the people, political leaders will be more aware of the people's needs and desires, thus shaping their policies to the best interests of society_ For instance, Shinzo Abe's decision to revoke Article 9 of Japan's Constitution has engendered much anger and frustration among the Japanese. Revoking Article 9 enables Japan to participate in conflicts or skirmishes in the rest of the world in the event that an ally requires help, With the Japanese rallying on the streets against Abe's nationalist agendas abroad, it is a clear signal to him that the Japanese people desire peace and stability. in Singapore, the opinions of the public have also guided the governance of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), giving rise to a higher standard of living for Singaporeans. After taking in the various woes of the people, Prime minister Lee Hsien Lacing implemented a slew of reforms and new social safety nets during the 2015 National Day Rally that greatly benefited the country's welfare. Raising the income ceiling for Executive Condominiums for example, has benefited middle-income Singaporeans who were at the mercy of rising costs of living. Evidently, by taking into account the views of the public, PM Lee was better able to come up with policies that reflected the wishes of the people. Therefore, public opinion can effectively act as a guide for political leaders, resulting in better governance for the welfare of society as a whole. 
Public opinion also serves as a check and balance to political leaders, preventing inefficiencies in governance or corruption from growing rampant, In societies that are politically aware, the public often keeps up to date with the government's actions and keeps a look out for any signs of inefficiency that could engender a country's downfall. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib Razak's recent corruption allegations have resulted in the worsening of the financial health of the economy, and a rapid fall of the Malaysian ringgit In response, many Malaysians have started peaceful protests against him, voicing their desire for him to step down from his position as Prime Minister, in what i5 known as the Bersih Movement. The prodigious amount of media coverage that the Bersih Movement has garnered is also attracting international criticism on Prime Minister Najib's governance, for what they feel is to the best interest of Malaysia. Public opinion can thus be a powerful tool that has the capability to bring change to a country's governance. Public leaders should thus not treat public opinion lightly and turn a blind eye to the demands of the people.

"Even in countries where air pollution levels remain sky high and are said to have reaching pathological levels, online activists are taking up a more vehement stand in demanding climate change. However, some might argue, political leaders cannot ignore the views of the majority as it would result to a tyranny by the majority that separates the majority from the minority. Yet, it 's important to note that foreign information may also always be through domestic sources, and could be derived by foreign opinions as well. ","Similarly in China, where air pollution levels are sky high and are deemed to have reached cancerous levels, online netizens are taking up a more proactive stance in demanding for change. With public opinion deeply critical of the ruling party's governance over China's environmental problems, Xi Jinping has started China's environmental clean up, which sees China pledging to reduce carbon emission levels to acceptable levels by 2020. Public opinion can therefore serve as a catalyst for change that could bring benefit to a country, should political leaders choose to heed it.
However, some might argue that political leaders should ignore the views of the public, as it could result in a tyranny of the majority that marginalises the views of the minority. By taking into account public opinion, political leaders are in danger of only heeding the views of the majority, which can only be a crucible for disaster. This is evident in Indonesia, where the government does what is in the best interest for the majority ethnic Indonesians at the expense of the Chinese. As a result, the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia are treated as second-class citizens and have the 'ethnic Chinese' label on their identity cards, as opposed to just 'Indonesian' for other citizens, in order to be differentiated easily. The marginalisation of the minority race can also be seen in Burma today, with secessionist movements from the Chins, Kachins and Karens erupting sporadically. This is the result of the government's intransigence of listening to the majority pro-Buddhist sentiments, and exacting laws in favour of public opinion. Hence, the tyranny of the majority is a problem that may arise when leaders heed public opinion. 
Yet, it is important to note that public opinion may not always stem from domestic sources, and could be derived from international opinions as well. Hence, more often than not, international public opinion can help political leaders make more informed choices that do not necessarily lead to the marginalisation of the minority. A noteworthy example is the freeing of political prisoners in Tazmamart, Morocco, due to the influence of international public opinion. After a coup d'etat carried out by a minority group against King Hassan II of Morocco, the insurgents were thrown into an underground prison for 18 years, one of the worst violations of human rights in history. Though this incident did not garner much attention in Morocco due to the prisoners being of a minority race, the prisoners were finally released due to international opinion that put pressure on the Moroccan government, demanding their immediate release. Hence, this shows that public opinion still remains as an important tool for good governance, as the international scope of it is a lightning rod for checks and balances against any governmental inefficacy. In conclusion, public opinion ""î both domestic and international ""î should more often than not, be heeded by political leaders. With the mandate of the people, political leaders at the forefront of governance can bring about change to a country that could better the lives of its citizens.

"For the variegated forms, principles and ideologies that guide a nation's policies from the economic pragmatism of Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP) to the paternalist socialism that man and governments alike espouse, the common denominator remains Global Government. Another of the problems modern governments encounter when formulating policies is what Enlightenment thinkers called ""the unenlighted masses"". And because of this policy, many have been invited to better utilise it to afford schooling to their children and even send them to universities. ","For the variegated forms of principles and ideologies that guide a nation's government, from the economic pragmatism of Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP) to the paternalistic socialism that man: Nordic governments traditionally espouse, the common denominator remains unchanged: Government policies. Government policies, be they couched in socialist, neoliberaI or even libertarian rhetoric when advocated by politicians are an indispensable tool to the government for a succinct reason: they have proven, time and time again, to be one of the most effective mechanisms with which the government can help its people to achieve what Plato called ""a good life"". However, there have been struggles for governments to strike a balance between succumbing to pressure and giving in to the demands of its people, and remain independent in decision-making. I am of the view that political leaders should ignore public opinion to a certain degree in order to make prudent and effective long-term plans for the country. 
One of the problems that politicians face when formulating policies is what political thinkers call ""the unenlightened masses"". Often, the masses are not as informed as they may fail to see what is best for the country. This often puts politicians in a constant struggle, as they need to please the people and, at the same time, implement policies that serve the country's long-term interest. Given the fact that most of the population is caught up in nine-to-five jobs, it is not a realistic goal for the entire population to understand policymaking and determine what the best policy is for the country. On the contrary, the politicians that we have selected have gone through rigorous training and have information that the public do not have access to. Thus, they are in a better position to decide what the best policy is for the country, even if the public might disagree. For example, the Pena government in Mexico is making bold economic reforms under the advice of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) graduate, and the ruling People's Action Party in Singapore also has politicians who have graduated from the world's top universities. Thus, politicians often have the necessary and relevant knowledge that the public does not possess. in fact, by ignoring public opinion, the Chinese government has achieved laudable results. In the late 1970s, the Chinese government enacted the famous one-child policy. The policy made the government notorious domestically back then because it was seen as an infringement of individual rights. 
However, because of the policy, families have been able to better utilise resources to provide education for their children and even send them to universities. As a result, the productivity of the entire society has increased and the twenty years of double-digit GDP growth serve as a testament to its success. Therefore, public policy making is a science that requires one to devote a considerate amount of time and energy. The masses generally do not have the knowledge and foresight and neither do they have the time to study the country's circumstances in detail, Thus, although the public might voice differing opinions, political leaders should ignore public opinion in their decision-making.

"Why the government sometimes needs to follow public will At fact, the extent to the political leaders who share this sentiment depends on the type of political system. The conclusion, although the modern democratic nations often face the menace of ""the unenlightened"", the government sometimes needs to be right in its stance, reminiscent of what the Foreign Ministers of Singapore said, ""they have to be both good-headed"" and fearless.","However, the government sometimes needs to follow public opinion. As the French political philosopher Montesquieu has pointed out, the government essentially has 'signed' a social contract with the people and therefore they should rule according to popular will. This is especially true when there is a divergence between what the government wants for the country and what the public want. When the people elect the government and give it the mandate to rule the country, people are expecting wise stewardship in return, and the government needs to respect the wishes of the people. The watershed election that happened in 2011 in Singapore illustrates the point. The People's Action Party IPAP), Singapore's ruling party, has always placed heavy emphasis on economic growth. Thus, the government has put in a series of policies to introduce more foreign workers in order to achieve higher GDP growth, However, some Singaporeans see things differently. A significant portion of the population does not wish to see so much competition or high economic growth at the expense of the locals' standard of living. The influx of foreign workers has catalysed many problems in Singapore such as the crowded transport system. Also, the added competition in the workplace is mentally debilitating and exhausting. Here, we have a clear divergence between the people's wishes and the government's goals. The people want a more enjoyable lifestyle whereas the government wants to pursue high GDP growth. In such cases, the government could then respect the public opinion and change its policies. Indeed, after the watershed election for the PAP which saw its popularity drop to the lowest in ten years, the government relaxed its strict prioritising of economic growth. Therefore, the government should not always ignore public opinion because when voters select the government, they are expecting the politicians to follow the popular will. Policy-making should thus be ""with the people"" and ""for the people"". 
In fact, the extent to which political leaders should ignore public opinion depends on the type of political system. If the system is democratic in nature, failure to follow public opinion may result in the government being unseated. This is what happened in the Ivory Coast. When the newly elected government decided to cut fuel subsidies, rowdy protests erupted and the military eventually took over the government. In contrast, when Indian politicians implemented crowd-pleasing policies like subsidies on food and electricity, the policies cemented the party's position as the next government, Although the Indian politicians are accused by the international community of taking a populist approach, the government is constrained by the political system and can only make changes bit by bit. A big overhaul to the system is certainly undesirable. On the other hand, China's one-party rule gives it all the power to enact any policies and the Communist Party in China thus has more freedom. Ignoring the public opinion would not result in immediate repercussions for the party. Hence, the party was able to implement the aforementioned one-child policy despite the fact that a significant portion of the public was against it. Therefore, it is clear that the political system does play a part in determining the extent to which the political leaders should and can ignore public opinion.
In conclusion, although the modern democratic nations often face the problem of ""the unenlightened masses"", the government sometimes needs to be firm in its stance, reminiscent of what the Prime Minister of Singapore said, ""We have to be both good-headed and hard-headed"". Political leaders should strive to strike a balance between insisting on their stand and making a compromise. After all, a nation's government should be with its people and for its people.

How far then, can political leaders ignore aid pay no attention to the views of the general populace considering that, after all, power and authority lies in the hands of the former? I believe that political leaders should riot disregard public sentiment to a large extent because this can cause devastating social repercussions for the nation. Furthermore, the government has a duty to ensure the welfare and security of its citizens and by ignoring public opinion, it utterly fails in the very duty it was established to fulfil. 
Ignorance of the people's views and opinions on certain matters can ultimately lead to detrimental social consequences, for this ignorance only serves to fuel the people's rage over the debated issues. This will then lead the people to take matters into their own hands and incite them to rebel, causing mass destruction and chaos_ The recent anti-alcohol protests in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu would serve as a pertinent example of this-Sasi Perumal, a Gandhian social activist, in protest of the rampant alcohol abuse by the people, climbed up a cell-phone tower where he bellowed chants, condemning the worrying situation in Tamil Nadu caused by alcohol abuse, such as increasing family problems and divorces. The district's emergency services tried to get him down from the tower, but despite a successful rescue, Sasi Perumal was unfortunately pronounced dead. This sparked widespread protests across Tamil Nadu where the people from all walks of life called for the closing of all alcohol shops. Despite the sheer number of protests and protesters, the state government took no action to comply with the people's sentiments and this only infuriated an already angry populace. Devastating social repercussions such as state-wide closure of shops and cessation of all public transport followed suit, causing much trouble and difficulty for the general public. Thus, it can be seen from this example that ignoring the people's opinion can culminate in adverse social consequences which will lead to chaos eventually. Thus, it is not apt for political leaders to ignore public opinion. 
Every government is established to provide welfare and security for its people and is obliged by social contract to do so. Thus, with regards to important issues that concern the bread and butter of the people, ignoring the people's opinions and views will only put the government in a negative light as it will have failed to address the problems that face the people, rendering its governance as a failure. A recent example that demonstrates this is the Land Reclamation Act in the Indian constitution. Under the secular Congress government, the Act stated that the government is allowed to take land from the farmers for developmental purposes only if it had sufficient consent from the farmers themselves. This reflected the populist, yet consultative nature of the Congress government. However, later when the economy-centric Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attempted to make changes to the Act, allowing the government to forcefully claim arable land from the farmers without their approval. This sparked outrage among the farmers and instigated protests across the nation. Yet the BJP was intent on passing this new Bill in parliament, amidst vehement opposition from other political parties. This example clearly illustrates that by disregarding the people's opinions, the government had failed to address the needs of the very electorate that conferred it its power and authority. This reflects badly on the government, leading the nation into disarray. Therefore, political leaders should not ignore public views.

"In addition, in countries that are multi-cultural and diverse, having a significant proportion of foreigners contributing to the progress of the nation, their government should merely allow the needs for locals before all else, as their exclusion may result into a gulf between locals and these foreigners, creating a potentially polarised society. However, under many scenarios especially when it concerns sensitive issues of food security, the government and political leaders may manipulate public opinion for the greater interest to that nation. In conclusion, it is overall unsuitable for political leaders to influence public opinion because even this may worsen an existing fragile social relationship while causing severe negative repercussions. ","In addition, in countries that are multi-cultural and diverse, with a significant proportion of foreigners contributing to the progress of the nation, the government cannot merely place the needs of locals before all else, as their actions may result in a gulf between locals and these foreigners, creating a polarised society. For example, Singapore is a small country with limited manpower given its ageing population and low birth rates, hence there is a great reliance on foreign talent to contribute to Singapore's economic growth. The pro-immigrant policies and influx of foreigners has resulted in social problems such as cultural differences and a strain on public services, resulting in a rise of xenophobic sentiments as seen in the 2013 Population White Paper protest. 
However, under certain circumstances, especially if it concerns sensitive issues like national security, the government and political leaders may ignore public opinion for the greater good of the nation. Public opinion may be powerful but is not always the best opinion or path that political leaders can take. For instance, the Internal Security Act (ISA) in Singapore has been criticised on many fronts as being too authoritative and stripping the individual of his freedom. Yet, one needs to consider the vulnerability of Singapore to external as well as internal threats. The ISA is necessary to safeguard the people from harm and prevent the tendrils of discord from taking root and growing in society, especially in a multicultural one like Singapore. This was evident in the 2004 arrests of suspected Islamic militants who were allegedly working for Al-Qaeda's Southeast Asian affiliate, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). This has prevented a large amount of damage being done to society because the Act allows internal security forces to detain, without trial, any individual suspected of being subversive in nature or posing a security threat to Singapore indefinitely. If public opinion were to be followed, then we would have to forego this Act and, possibly, our strong security for the people. This may do more harm than good in the future. Thus, it is permissible for political leaders to ignore the public opinion when it comes to issues pertaining to sensitive and top-priority matters like national security, so as to ensure the greater good for the people. 
In conclusion, it is overall unsuitable for political leaders to ignore public opinion because doing so may worsen an already fragile social fabric, thus causing severe negative repercussions. Also, failing to heed the sentiments may result in the failure of the government in redressing the issues of the people, the very purpose for which it was elected for. Nonetheless, critical matters like national security must be handled with care and caution. In this regard, political leaders may ignore their people's views so as to secure a better future for the nation. This is a complex issue with no clear guidelines. Hence, political leaders must balance both public opinion and the interests of the nation and according to these parameters, act in the most appropriate manner that puts the country and citizens' interests as top-priority.

"One thousand years since Plato wrote his grand thesis for ideal government, ' The Republic ,' many societies throughout the world have adopted the concept of the democratic republic where public officials are chosen by the tax man. A transparent government where all all views are adequately represented in government, while allowing the government to respond to any immediate questions and concerns that citizens might face. Democracy is also an only ideal form of government for today the world because it ensures that governments remain fully accountable to their people. ","Two thousand years since Plato wrote his grand thesis on ideal government, 'The Republic', many countries throughout the world have adopted the system of a democratic government, where elected officials are chosen by the common man. There are varying degrees of democracy, from full direct democracies like Switzerland, to more flawed and quasi-authoritarian ones, like Indonesia. Nonetheless, a common thread of representation of the people runs through all democracies deserving of this moniker. This engenders a pertinent question that has become especially imperative amidst the rise of successful non-democratic regimes: is democracy the most ideal form of government in today's world? As Winston Churchill once mused, democracy has many flaws, but it is indeed the best form of government that we currently have. Even as we see the perils of democracy in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, Churchill's words still ring true even to this day. 
A democratic government ensures that people' views are adequately represented in government, thereby allowing the state to respond to the immediate challenges and issues that citizens might face. In today's multifaceted and complex world, a myriad of problems plague governments, from economic issues such as sustaining economic growth and reducing unemployment, to social ones like infrastructure, healthcare and education, and even matters concerning national security. The range of challenges to be addressed is diverse and there is no one panacea to identify and solve them all. In this respect, citizens need to exercise their voice, by electing lawmakers who will address their issues and represent their views. Democratic representation yields effective and positive responses by governments to problems that citizens wish to see solved. In the United Kingdom, arguably the world's oldest democracy, elections are routinely held every four to five years to keep the government attuned to the prevailing political mood of the country. In the most recent elections held in 2015, the Conservative Party won a majority in Parliament on the basis of addressing the most prominent issues which citizens face, including maintaining economic stability and growth, and re-evaluating Britain's place in the European Union. The newly elected government, within its first year in office, kept to its election manifesto by delivering high economic growth and low inflation, and promising to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, to be held in June of 2016. The steadfast response by a democratically elected government in solving issues which citizens care most about is testament to the enduring success of democracy as the best form of government in this day and age. 
Democracy is also the most ideal form of government in today's world because it ensures that governments are held accountable to the people. With greater distrust of the state by the public in recent decades amidst corruption scandals, democratic governance helps remedy the situation by giving its citizens the power to eject a sitting government and replace it with one more attuned to their needs. Elections are held periodically as a litmus test of public opinion on a government's record while in office. Actions that the government pursue or neglect will be rewarded or punished accordingly by the public, thus acting as an effective 'check-and-balance' to a self-servient or incompetent bureaucracy.

"In some cases, a government representing its people could be so inept in their duty, that it will be booted out of office entirely. Advertising in recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented success of repressive regimes, led to some anti-democracy advocates shunning and branding prevailing perceptions of them, an achronistic or outdated. They also argue that democracies are populist with ways hence elected government ministers or lawmakers will take what is popular and not necessarily right. ","In some cases, the government representing its people could be so inept in its duty, that it is unceremoniously booted out of office entirely. Prior to 2001, Turkey was ruled by a coalition of different political parties, with many differing aims and views on various matters of government. Policies were half-baked and ill-executed, and much money was wasted on inefficient and overly-bureaucratic public bodies. The Turkish people became so disillusioned and upset about the state of affairs in the country that in the 2001 elections, they proceeded to boot every sitting member of Parliament from the governing coalition, and replace them with politicians who had no experience in government, but promised to bring about radical change. More recently, in the Irish general election in February 2016, the Labour Party, who was in coalition with Fine Gael, lost almost blue-collared voters, particularly as it ceded much of its power and influence to its conservative partner in government support bled to Sinn Fein and other anti-austerity parties, who promised to represent the views of the working-class voters. From these examples, it can be observed that democratic systems are fundamental in ensuring accountable governments which will abide by their promises and serve the people, thus proving once again why democracies are the best form of government in today's world. 
Admittedly, in recent years, we have seen the unprecedented success of authoritarian regimes, leading to many anti-democracy advocates shunning and denouncing prevailing perceptions of democracy as anachronistic and outdated. They claim that democracy brings about instability in government; rapid, successive changes in government leads to discontinuation of policies and results in existing measures being reversed, if not entirely eradicated. Polarised legislatures and minority governments might lead to government gridlock and watered-down government policies, causing responses to exigent matters to either be delayed or inadequate in scope. The most infamous instance of this which comes to mind would be the government shutdown in the United States in September of 2013. The bicameral legislature, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives, were each controlled by two separate political parties with diametrically opposed ideologies-the Democrats and the Republicans respectively. When it came to passing a crucial government budget with healthcare reforms embedded within it, the two parties disagreed vehemently and failed to come to a compromise. The failure to pass the budget bill by the allocated deadline led to a ""government shutdown"", whereby all public services, excluding essential ones like the police or the military, ceased to operate for two weeks. This had an adverse impact on ordinary citizens' lives, as waste went uncollected and piled up on the streets, post offices and libraries were shuttered, mail was undelivered and schools were closed. The resulting damage on the public by the failure of two democratically elected political parties was enormous, and has happened many times before, the worst in 1998 when such a shutdown lasted for eight complete months, Also, with a volatile economy and terrorist threats like the Islamic State on the horizon, the instability and inefficiency caused by democracies is argued by critics to disprove the notion that democracies are in fact the best form of governance in today's world. 
Detractors also claim that democracies are populist in nature, hence elected government officials and lawmakers will do what is popular but not necessarily right. In desperate bids to win re-election and retain their powers, governments often play to the whims and fancies of the voters, even if the public is wrong on substantive issues. The public mood could become drastically altered should a significant event occur, resulting in a ""herd mentality"" where a certain policy is perpetuated by the public without consideration of the negative effects it might entail. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States, public opinion shifted drastically in favour of the United States militarily intervening in Iraq and toppling the then-ruler, Saddam Hussein. The elected government, influenced by the overwhelming public support, decided to enter Iraq in 2003, launching an all-out offensive on the Iraqi government and toppling Saddam Hussein, while installing a pro-American government in his place. The fallout, though not immediate, was clearly seen in the years which followed, whereby insurgent militant groups seized control of various parts of Iraq and decimated the region, producing chaos and leaving an indelible stain on the United States' foreign policy doctrine. Such reckless endeavours are said to be hardly seen in non-democracies, like China. The Communist Party of China often ignores public sentiment when executing its policies, instead choosing to pursue an aggressive economic plan to revitalise the Chinese economy. Villages and towns were demolished to make way for mile-high skyscrapers and large factories, while workers' rights were compromised to attract foreign companies into the nation. The result is omnipresent and ubiquitous in China, as its rapid economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty, and brought about immense Prosperity to the Chinese society as a whole. Should China have been a democracy, the continuation of Policies which precipitated this ""economic miracle"" would not have existed, as officials may yield to public pressure, failing to deliver actual reforms. all of its Parliamentary seats as the Party was believed to have abandoned its core constituency of working-class.

"At the outbreak of a Cold War and its preceding World Wars II in 1945, capitalism and communism have long been in competition to determine what form of government was closest to the former. With the emergence of the Information Age and our Global Wide Web, citizens are, ever more so than before, exposed about internet happen ings and its users throughout the world.","With the outbreak of the Cold War and the preceding World War II in 1945, democracy and communism have constantly been in competition to determine which form of government is superior to the other. However, with the fall of the world's leading communist country ""î the Soviet Union ""î and the consequent victory of the United States of America, the proud poster boy of democracy, it seems like democracy has won. Democracy's victory is still carried on today with the majority of countries adopting this form of government which heeds the voices of their people. It is not difficult to see why democracy is the best form of government in today's world, where citizens, especially the youth, are becoming more active in politics and want their voices to be heard; where the global economy is facing an eminent crisis and there is a need for credible Leaders to remain in power; where there is an ever more unstable global political climate, and there is a greater need to ensure no one is marginalised through checks and balances.
With the advent of the Information Age and the World Wide Web, citizens are, ever more so than before, exposed to the happenings of its country and the world beyond. They increasingly want their voices to be heard by the government. The freedom of expression present in democracies would allow the citizens to voice their concerns without the fear of being clamped down by the government and this gives them an opportunity to be more involved in politics. This would include elections which accord citizens with the right to decide who will govern them, Through the analysis of the results of elections, governments are also more aware of the concerns of their people and are better able to address them. In 2011, the sentiment of Singaporeans was one of dissatisfaction with the state for insisting on its rightist, non-welfare stance. The voices of Singaporeans were undeniably heard through their votes, with the ruling party securing only 60.1% of the popular vote, the lowest since the country's birth. This served to ""shock"" the government into implementing more leftist policies such as the Pioneer Generation Package, and resolving pressing issues from the 2011 elections such as the inadequate supply of public housing. These rectifications undoubtedly gave rise to the ruling party's landslide victory in 2015 with 69.9% of the popular vote. A democratic government's holding of free elections and preservation of the universal right to free speech allows its citizens to play a more active role in politics and co-create their future with the government.

"With a global economy facing a eminent downturn, there 's an ever-increasing need today for credible leaders, who become accessible and proven, to stay in power, something a democratic government can prevent. It can be argued why any authoritarian government, such as China, provides greater opportunities for the economy and growth as the government retains a powerful influence over its economy and people by harshly cracking down on dissent. In addition, when terrorist groups such as ISIS and Boko State gain in prominence and the global security climate grows ever more unstable, it is crucial we have a form of government, a proper judiciary system and checks, balances, to guarantee that no one segment in society feels marginalised. ","With the global economy facing an eminent downturn, there is an ever-pressing need today for credible leaders, who are tested and proven, to stay in power ""î something a democratic government can Provide. Citizens are often the best judges of the effects of the changes made by their government. They are after all the beneficiaries of most if not all, of the country's policies, both foreign and domestic. Handing the electorate the power to choose their leader adds pressure on the government to live up to their expectations or be voted out come the next round of elections. For example, the ousting of Tony Abbott in September 2015 saw Australia ushering in her fourth Prime Minister in 2 years ""î Malcolm Turnbull ""î who following promised a more consultative government and the sweeping out of traditional conservatives from the Cabinet Abbott's dismal attempts to revitalise Australia's economy. This stringent selection and ousting of leaders ensures that only those who truly deserve to lead the country can do so. 
It may be argued that an authoritarian government, such as China, provides greater stability for the economy to grow as the government has a greater control over its economy and people by harshly clamping down on dissent. While this may have undeniably promoted the growth of China's economy, as evidenced by sustained double-digit growth rates up until 2010, and increased China's standing as it boasts the most reserves a country has in the world, this often results in negative consequences which cannot be eliminated while still under this form of government. In a bid to appear more attractive to foreign investors, China often compromises on the wages of workers and does not strictly adhere to the regulations on the working conditions of factories. Granted, such practices may occur in democratic countries like India and Indonesia. However, awareness of such malpractices and the subsequent rectification are often too belated, especially in communist countries like China. Attempts by the marginalised citizens to voice their concerns are often muted by government officials who scour the internet for any anti-government sentiments. Admittedly, there may be economic growth, but this is often at the expense of citizens who are silenced by an authoritative government. 
In addition, as terrorist groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram gain more prominence and the global political climate becomes ever more unstable, it is crucial to have a form of government with a proper judiciary system and checks and balances, to ensure that no one group in society feels marginalised. In democratic governments, there are often debates held in court before a bill. Such stringent measures ensure that the enacted law are absolutely necessary and does not put anyone at a disadvantage. In Singapore, Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) require at least one member to be from a minority race to ensure that the rights of minority groups are upheld and their concerns expressed. In the USA, some politicians may insist on anti-Muslim laws, such as the temporary banning of entry of Muslims into the country due to a rise of Islamic radicalism. However, checks and balances ensure that such laws which discriminate against a particular group of people are not passed in court, and no unnecessary damage is done to the social fabric of a country.

"As such the method of negotiation and consultation may sometimes prove to be insufficient due to the very different views held between different parties, leading some to question the actual implementation if it. And as the gains against surveillance remain strong many fall short as they remain incognito to fundamental principles of justice and the impact that democracies have in the world. In conclusion, while an autocratic government often brings a more stable economy and forms a government with fewer populist voices, a politician's ultimate goal remains to have their way. ","However, such a method of debate and discussion may sometimes prove to be inconclusive due to the very different views held by different parties, leading some to question the actual effectiveness of democracy. One example is Thailand, where the military junta took over the civilian government due to the latter's indecisiveness and inefficacy. However, there have been protests after the takeover, demanding the return to a civilian government, but with a better ruler. The citizens ultimately still crave for their voices to be heard in government, on top of escaping the oppressiveness which so often comes with military rule. This further proves that a democratic government is the one which is truly suited for today's world. Admittedly, democracies often fail short as they place immense power in the hands of the common people who may be less than informed about foreign and domestic policy. This may result in political figures or parties being elected into office simply because of their populist stance, which may not be in the country's best interest. Some may also win the votes of people through their charisma, although they may not be the most capable or non-corrupt candidate. This was the case when the Philippines elected the charismatic former film-star Joseph Estrada as their President in 1998. He was eventually found to have stolen $80 million from the government. However, democracy is still the superior form of governance as it pacifies the increasingly educated public who want their right to vote to be preserved. Thus, this necessitates a free media, which will keep the electorate fully informed of the profiles of the election candidates, and remind them of the power each vote possesses. 
Even as the arguments against democracy remain compelling, they fall short as they remain incognisant of the principles of governance, and the impact that democracies have on the world. The limitations of democracies, be it the creation of instability or the enactment of populist policies, are being addressed by an increasingly educated public and the implementation of measures to curb such actions, such as longer election cycles. More and more countries are moving towards democratic systems of government, like Saudi Arabia, which recently introduced municipal elections in 2014. The democratisation of autocracies and authoritarian regimes corroborates the positive impact democratic government brings, and despite current threats to the world's security, democracy as a method of government remains to be the best form of government, not just in today's world, but of all time.
In conclusion, while an autocratic government often creates a more stable economy and forms a government with fewer dissenting views, the people's ultimate wish is to have their voices heard. Furthermore, a democratic government is able to address many such inherent issues in today's world, such as an unstable political climate and a declining global economy. These, together with democracy's ability to allow for the voices of the people to be heard, present democracy as the best form of government in today's world.

"In today 's world, capitalism remains the best form of government, despite the big players, well as the United States of America, and even formerly socialist states such as Yugoslavia and Hungary choosing democracy as their choice of government. Democracy is even regarded as an optimal form of government for today's world as it allows the people the ability to elect their representatives a right which is highly valued in today's age. Furthermore, populism by allowing for free competition in elections also means for leaders that may be marginalized in society to be victorious.","In today's world, democracy remains the dominant form of government, with many big players, such as the United States of America, and even formerly socialist countries such as Yugoslavia and Hungary adopting democracy as their choice of government. Democracy is characterized by promises of freedoms such as the freedom of speech and assembly; regular, free and fair elections, and a system of check and balances. The people are given the power to elect their representatives in parliament representatives, having been elected by universal suffrage, owe it to the electorate to represent their interests and be their voice in the government. Democracy may be the optimal form of government as it gives the people the power to vote in those who they think are capable leaders, and vote out those who underperform. It also provides a fair playing field for leaders who may not otherwise have the chance to be elected under a non-democratic system. However, democracy may not always guarantee that the best leaders are elected, due to the changing social environment and sentiments of the people way. Nevertheless, democracy, while not being the best and most perfect system, remains the optimal form of government in today's world. 
Democracy may be regarded as the optimal form of government in today's world as it gives the people the ability to elect their government, a right that is highly valued in today's society. A trademark of democracy is that people's voices are heard through free and fair elections, in which they are able to exercise their right through voting. As such, people are able to choose who they think are capable leaders and vote these leaders in. At the same time, this means being able to vote incompetent or corrupted leaders out of the government For example, in Singapore, during the 2015 General Elections, the residents of the Punggol East single member constituency voted the incumbent Workers' Party out, This may be due to the displeasure of the residents at the supposed mishandling of funds by the Workers' Party in administrating the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council. As such, the residents voiced their displeasure by exercising their right to vote and choosing to elect Mr Charles Chong, the candidate from the People's Action Party instead. Similarly, in Malaysia, opposition parties are now forming alliances and gathering strength to legally oust the incumbent Prime Minister (PM) Najib Razak from his position. As said by the former Prime Minister Mahathir, the upcoming Malaysian elections will be the only way to legally and rightfully unseat PM Najib after his implication and role in the 1MDB saga, which saw more than $1 billion lost in alleged corruption. Clearly, democracy is seen by many as an optimal way to show the discontent and displeasure at the incompetency and corruption of political leaders. This is because democracy gives the people the power to choose their representatives, and hence, the power to remove these representatives as well. This not only ensures that representatives are made responsible to govern the country in a clean and efficient way, it also ensures a system of checks and balances in the country. 
Furthermore, democracy, in allowing for free competition and participation, also allows for leaders who may be marginalized in society to be elected. In many countries, especially during the 20th century, politics was seen as an arena for men. However, increasingly in today's world, women are seen as equally capable of leading. With a democratic structure in place, women are given an equal chance to le elected as leaders as well. For example, in Germany, Angela Merkel was elected as Germany's first female chancellor, and has gone on to lead Germany, while positioning herself as a decisive and capable leader as issues such as the migrant crisis that Europe currently faces. With democracy, marginalized groups such women are given equal chances at having their leadership recognized.

"Because it's most useful in asking for the voice of minority groups and societies to be heard. However, it can quickly argued a democracy's not the perfect form of government, as elected people do almost always pick the best, or least effective leaders. Yet, democracy remains the most ideal economic model and authoritarian governments centralize capital resulting in widespread nepotism, violence and corruption. ","Furthermore, it is also useful in allowing for the voice of minority groups in societies to be heard. For example, in the United States, the democratic structure made it possible for the people's choice to be respected, allowing for the successful election of Mr Barack Obama as America's first black President. Thus, it can be seen that democracy, in being able to level the playing field for the previously marginalized, to represent and consider the interests of the minorities, and to represent the votes and voices of the people, remains the most optimal and preferred form of government in today's world. 
However, it can be argued that democracy is not the best form of government, as the people do not always elect the best, or most effective representatives. In today's world, the electorate is increasingly voting for a radical change, and these sentiments often do not take into consideration the competencies of the candidates. For example, in the ongoing Presidential Elections in the United States (US), real estate mogul, Donald Trump, is leading the polls in being the Republicans Party's candidate for presidency. This is despite Trump not having any previous experience in politics. He has also made racist and Islamophobic promises should he be elected as President, such as to erect a wall to keep the Mexicans out of the US, and to temporarily bar all Muslims from entering the US. Clearly, Trump appears to be highly incompetent, Islamophobic, and a racist. In no way is he suitable to be the President of the world's most powerful country. However, Americans are still showing their support for him through their votes as he represents a radical change from the kind of political leaders that the US has seen. As reported by the American media, this may be because Americans are jaded from years of government inefficiencies in tackling budget deficits and the rising number of immigrants in the us. As such, while democracy gives people the right to vote, the people may not be fully rational and vote for capable leaders. Such a trend, in which the electorate votes on popular sentiment and not on rational thinking, does not only happen in America. In Britain, Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as Labour Party's candidate for the Prime Minister after internal voting was opened to all party members, despite Corbyn not having had any form of political experience. in France, Marine Le Pen is leading in popular polls for the Presidential elections to be held in 2017, after promising that she will tackle immigration issues by closing off French borders, a promise that is highly reactive and radical, aimed at gaining the popular vote. Evidently, in today's world, the electorate is increasingly influenced by radical leaders playing on the emotional fears and concerns of the electorate. As such, their votes may not be rational and may instead spell doom for the country. Hence, in view of such a global trend of irrational voters, democracy may not be the best system as the people increasingly show that they are unable to rationally elect competent leaders. 
Yet, democracy remains the most ideal political system as authoritarian systems centralise power, resulting in widespread nepotism, cronyism and corruption. For example, in China, businesses often have to bribe officials to start up operations, causing lax regulations as government officials become corrupted. This results in the people not being able to trust the government to represent their needs, welfare, and voices, especially when lax regulations end up compromising the well-being and safety of the society. For example, the2010 milk powder scandal in China whereby melamine was found in baby's milk powder resulted in the deaths of many infants who consumed the milk, This incident was the result of corruption and lax regulations, and hence the government is seen to be no longer capable of being the voice and caretaker of the people. Authoritarian systems also often suppress individual rights such as freedom of speech and expression. For example, in 2016, four booksellers in Hong Kong disappeared mysteriously after selling and distributing books containing anti-Chinese government sentiments. These disappearances have been linked to the Chinese government's attempts to suppress subversive views in Hong Kong, amidst increasing unhappiness at the two-countries-one-system rule, as well as calls for Hong Kong's independence in recent years. The suppression of freedom of speech and expression is in stark contrast to countries adopting the democratic form of government, in which freedom of speech and expression is a protected right. For example, in the US, not only are publications and comments that are anti-government allowed to be published, rallies and protests are also allowed to be staged. Thus, it can be seen that the alternative to democracy is not ideal for the people in today's world as the people lose confidence in these corrupted governments. Furthermore, such authoritarian governments often suppress personal liberties, which, in today's world, are seen as rights entitled to the people. Thus, the people have voiced their rejection of centralized and authoritarian rule. For example, in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central movement in 2014 was led by students from the local universities to protest against the Chinese government's reluctance to allow Hong Kong to hold fair elections. In view of these anti-authoritarian protests, it is clear that democracy remains the favoured form of government over authoritarian systems.

Amongst his concerns of democracy was the 'tyranny of the majority', where an uneducated majority might vote for populist governments instead of one that truly cared for the people's long term interests. Having won a hard-fought victory against the Axis Powers in World War 2, he was to succumb to the power of the ballot box less than a year later. While one might be tempted to dismiss his view, especially as the world was a very different place in the 1940s, his concerns still ring true in today's world. The rise of the populist far-right and the far-heft across Europe and America has stunned many, leading them to wonder whether democracy is truly the best form of government in today's world, I would argue that it is, both because of the repercussions of autocratic rule and also the natural gravitation towards democratic rule in our modern world. 
The argument against unfettered democracy has been made stronger over the past couple of months with the rise of populist parties spouting xenophobic and racist views. This is indeed one problem of democracy: the tyranny of the majority, that it means is that the majority demographic of a democratic nation would over time, gain power over minority groups as their support alone would guarantee the victory of governments that favour them. These governments, to further gain additional support Worn their main demographic, might discriminate against minority groups in order to give the majority certain privileges. While such populist governments are yet to be elected in significant numbers in the major nations, they are now getting frighteningly close. In France, Marine Le Pen's right-wing National Front has won major state-wide elections and could win the presidential election next year. She has proposed harsher crime laws on minority groups, and wants a major crackdown on immigrants. Such trends can be seen all over Europe: in Sweden and Italy, where poll numbers for populist parties have surged, and in Poland where the xenophobic Law and Justice Party now forms the government. Donald Trump's ascent in the US Republican presidential primaries has been even more alarming. He has threatened to ban all Muslims from the US, build a giant wall along the Mexican border and step up the use of police force in black communities. Their actions are shocking because few would have expected such deep-rooted racism and extreme views to gain so much traction in these bastions of liberty and tolerance. Worse, their surging poll numbers have prodded them to continue doubling down on minorities, 
With that said, the prevalent alternative, autocracy would be much worse, particularly because autocratic governments lack diversity and have already been implementing discriminative policies. In Brunei and Saudi Arabia, Sharia Law, imposed on all citizens, even on non-Muslims, punishes views and actions that go contrary to the Muslim tradition, via stoning or execution in some cases. As such, democracy is the best form of government in today's world because it protects human rights and liberty better than other existing forms of governance. Unlike democratic nations, in autocratic nations, criminal cases go through a rubber-stamp court, without proper judicial independence.

"Critics argue that such early concepts of balance and control are inefficient. The benefits to critics of democracy espouse for democracy only apply, however, though benevolent dictators. In today's globalised world, where human right abuses are shared by any rest of the world, and a populace cannot gossip about any rest of the population through the Internet, any other forms of government and democracy can no longer exist in the long-term. ","Critics argue that such a system of balance and power is inefficient. They argue that autocracy and one-party state rule are better than true democracy because they are more efficient in running a country, First, they argue that autocratic rulers make right rather than popular decisions. Second, they argue that autocratic governments are more concerned with long-term instead of short-term interests. Third, they argue that in an emergency, democracies would take far too long to resolve crises, because each action has to be agreed by all three branches of government. Their arguments are not unfounded. Singapore's and China's extraordinary economic success with double-digit growths in GDP at their peaks might not have been possible if their governments changed every term. Furthermore, a fully democratic government in China might not have had the courage to implement the one-child policy, and in Singapore, the CPF system, both of which, while unpopular, have long term benefits to social welfare and the economy. Today, Xi Jinping's crackdown on corruption would not have been undertaken on such a scale in a democratic nation. It draws parallels to Brazil, where a corruption scandal involving oil giant, Petrobras and politicians has plagued the nation. Opposing parties are angry at one another, and little progress has been achieved in recent years. 
The benefits that critics of democracy espoused to autocracy only apply, however, to benevolent dictatorship. The biggest problem of autocracy is the lack of guarantee that the next ruler would similarly have the nation's best interests in mind. There would be no checks and balances on his power. And no ballot box to keep him on his toes. In communist Russia, which was essentially an autocracy, we saw how Stalin took power and through his purges and war crimes eventually weakened his nation, making it worse than during Lenin's rule. 
In today's globalised world, where human rights abuses are shared with the rest of the world, where the populace can learn about the rest of the world through the Internet, any other forms of government except democracy can no longer exist in the long-term. Even China has since been liberalised., first through market reforms, and now by listening to its people more. Hence, democracy is the best form of government in today's world because it takes care of its people best through protection of human rights and liberty. These are safeguarded by checks and balances on power and an assurance of accountability and responsibility to the populace through elections. The gaining of traction for extremist parties should not be blamed on democracy itself. Rather, it should be blamed on a failure to educate the populace and as importantly, the dismissal by establishment parties of deep-rooted anger about issues such as income inequality and the influx of immigrants. Such anger has been the catalyst of racism, hatred and extremism. Democracies would learn well from multi-cultural Switzerland where referendums on discriminative or short-sighted policies are seldom passed despite their direct democracy system which encourages many referendums. It would thus be wise that we improve upon our policies to support democracies, instead of arguing against it. It is therefore true, to a very large extent that democracy is the best form of government in today's world.

"In democracies, human rights and liberty are more secure because the red box builds accountability and authority for the governed. Democracies also provide check and balance on unfettered power and prevent one corrupt dictator from controlling his country. In general whilst democracy might still sound ideal as it does have its shortcomings, such as its vulnerability to the irrational choices by the populace it still is our preferred form of government. ","In democracies, human rights and liberty are more protected because the ballot box ensures accountability and responsibility to the populace. Human rights and liberty are extremely important because they ensure the protection of the citizens of a state, and give them the freedom to pursue whatever is in their best interests. Elections every four to five years serve as a referendum on government policies: whether their policies have sufficiently protected the rights of the people and whether the people have been well taken care of since the last election. Democracy expands the government's concern from doing whatever it takes to maintain its grip on power to taking care of the majority of the population's interests. 
Democracies also provide checks and balances on unfettered power to prevent a power-hungry dictator from destroying his country. Most democracies have three branches of government: Judiciary, Executive and Legislative. The courts, parliaments, and the cabinet help safeguard the country by checking on the duties of each other and have the power to restrict one another's capability. In the US, for example, the President has the power to veto Congress, Congress has the power to impeach the President, and the Supreme Court has the power to overturn the President's executive orders. All these have happened many times even in the short span of the last 4 years of the Obama administration and ensured that laws passed and actions taken do not violate the constitution, and represent the nation's interests best. 
In conclusion, while democracy may not be ideal as it does have its shortcomings, such as its vulnerability to the irrational choices of the electorate, it still remains the best form of government. Such a viewpoint, however, may not be apt in analysing the value of Singapore's history, as it attempts to conflate a perceived absence of similarities between our past and present with the belief that our past is irrelevant. This does not always hold true, as it is possible for us to still draw parallels between seemingly disparate events that happened decades ago in spite of the constantly changing socio-economic climate. For example, while one may feel that studying Communism is largely irrelevant to modern Singapore, the methods the government used to tackle them in the past remain pertinent in dealing with another threat of equal magnitude: terrorism. Both have the expressed aim of destabilising a nation through violent means to establish a new government with a radical ideology. Just as the Communists incited their followers towards sectarian strife, such as in the Hock Lee Bus Riots, modern-day religious terrorists continue to incite aggression against countries like Singapore to establish religious dominance in Asia. By teaching this to our youths, we can deliver a stark reminder that peace should not be taken for granted. This aims to mould youths into concerned citizens who have a strong sense of civic responsibility and take an active role in bettering the lives of others around them Such a goal is achieved by ensuring that students remain continually mentally prepared for such future scenarios. Another example is the importance of educating youth on the foundations of the multi-cultural society that Singapore is built up upon. With the clamour against the Population. White Paper, it is necessary for us to continually remember that Singapore was built through welcoming immigrants with open arms. It is through these past waves of a migrants from India, China, etc., that Singapore had the necessary talent and labour to build herself up from. As such, it is vital to introduce concepts of racial harmony and meritocracy to our youths to justify the nothing. importance of going beyond tolerance and towards appreciation, in their interactions with new immigrants. Hence, while a one-on-one comparison is admittedly difficult at times, many parallels can still be drawn from past events to teach the workforce of tomorrow.

"Even before Plato proclaimed its virtues with the masterpiece, ' Me Republic ',  democracy has always been vaunted as a ""story of freedom for the West"". It was evidently not the best form of governance after all. But there is a fine distinction in protecting liberty rights while safeguarding extremist. ","Ever since Plato extolled its virtues in his masterpiece, 'Me Republic', democracy has always been vied as a ""beacon of hope"" by the West. It has invariably been conferred to be a sacrosanct right. Not only does democracy entail the protection of human rights, it also ensures that the vox populi will be factored in governance. Hence, it is the preferred method of governance for many countries in today's world. Yet has deviated from theory. While democracy claims to ensure that everyone has an equal voice, majority rule continues to be a vexing issue. Likewise, the enshrining of human rights has the potential to open the floodgates for extremist views to proliferate. In their need to cater to the populace, politicians also frequently enact policies that are popular, but not necessarily ideal. Thus, rather than aspire towards a more democratic civilisation, I opine that an amalgamation of democracy and socialism would be more ideal, as the strengths of socialism can aid in countering the flaws of democracy. 
Democracy is evidently not the best form of governance after all. Democracy ensures that fundamental human rights are upheld, thus ensuring that no one is unfairly oppressed. In a democratic system, the average citizen is accorded certain rights which the State is prohibited from infringing on. For instance, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution respects the infallibility of freedom of speech, ensuring that the citizens are able to enjoy a certain degree of freedom. With such freedom, one is able to express his views liberally, without being under a constant fear of suppression. This has also led to the emancipation of minority groups, who would otherwise suffer more in an authoritarian system. The ideals of ""Liberty, Equality and Fraternity"" as professed by the French Revolution are a clarion call that continues to resound through the years. Unlike traditional feudalism, democracy aims to overcome class barriers and social hierarchies, giving everyone an equal opportunity to succeed in life. Meritocracy, a key principle of democracy, aims to realise this. Rather than face discrimination and prejudice, individuals in a democratic state are accorded equal opportunities to succeed, regardless of their race or religion. This revolutionary concept has ensured that all individuals, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are able to truly enjoy a better life. Thus, the freedom to work and the freedom from marginalisation have elevated the importance of upholding democracy in the modern era. 
However, there is a fine distinction between protecting human rights and safeguarding extremist views. In a liberal democracy, there is an incessant danger of the proliferation of radical voices. In contrast, more authoritarian societies are able to use draconian measures to crack down on such unorthodox views, and can curb their spread rapidly. For instance, China is able to use extralegal methods such as black jails to check the spread of such dissent, which is unlikely to be replicated in democratic states due to the respect for freedom of speech. In practice, it is thus imprudent to confer such unchecked freedom. In the USA, the Westboro Baptist Church is a notable example of how intolerance and bigotry can thrive in a democratic society. Its members are aggressively anti-homosexual and anti-abortion, and they frequently stage Inflammatory protests. Such acts are only able to survive due to the creation of a society where criticizing another's opinion is viewed negatively, even if it is derogatory in nature. Another infamous incident is the murder of 69 innocent adults and children by Anders Behring Breivik, a self-professed right-wing extremist. Not only was his self-radicalisation unchecked, he was also able to find sympathisers in society. He was only able to thrive for so long as he was from Sweden, which prides herself on her high levels of freedom. Nonetheless, in cases such as this, freedom is evidently unwarranted. Ultimately, a Catch-22 situation would result: ensuring freedom also protects radicals, but restricting extremists leads to clamours for more freedom. Hence, in solving one problem, democracy opens the floodgates to a far more vexing one.
