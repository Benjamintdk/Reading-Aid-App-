With increasing interconnectivity in a shrinking global village, the world today is fraught with conflicts that extend beyond a country’s borders, characterised by an unnerving sense of uncertainty and volatility. With the threat of religious fundamentalism, growing social inequality in the aftermath of rapid globalisation and international disputes abounding across the globe, it appears as though governments are increasingly losing influence and power in managing the conflicts of today. This is perhaps evident in the growing unhappiness of civilians with their incumbent rulers, leading to a spate of protests and even uprisings in extreme cases. However, to say that governments are powerless to deal with the conflicts of today would be to be too nihilistic a view, and suggests that people or other organisations instead should be held accountable to deal with the conflicts of today. Certainly, while conflicts may seem to overheat at times, it is undeniable that governments possess the resources, influence and legitimacy to tackle the problems of today. Hence, although some conflicts may be beyond the reach of governments, most are still within the power of the governments to manage and control. 

Indeed, governments may seem to be powerless in the face of conflicts that cannot be controlled within their own borders, particularly ideological threats that plant seeds of discord within and beyond the country. The rise of religious extremism and the encroaching threat of terrorism in countries all over the world are testament to the transnational nature of conflicts today. Such threats can hardly be confined to a particular group or nation, and the very fact that it is faceless makes it almost impossible for governments to tackle the problem. The rise of ISIS, for example, was completely unanticipated, where the Islamic militia swept through Syria and captured great swathes of land within hours. In addition, the media and propaganda branch of ISIS simultaneously began a hashtag movement #AlleyesonISIS, featuring atrocities committed by the jihadist fighters so as to instil fear and a sense of inevitability among the people. Certainly, ISIS’s effective use of social media platform to recruit potential jihadists from all around the world and to spread the utopian vision of an Islamic caliphate has rendered governments powerless in controlling the spread of terrorism. Despite increased security measures being implemented, the unpredictable nature of terrorist and lone wolf attacks often make such efforts ineffective or even futile. In the face of religious zeal and fervour, governments are unable to wield decisive and conclusive power for fear the proactive measures may add fuel to the fire, leading to more atrocities and resulting in a stronger backlash. Thus, in the face of borderless and ideological conflicts, governments may seem to be powerless in controlling the spread of extremism and in effectively protecting their citizens.

However, while governments are limited in their power to curb ideological conflicts within their borders, the power of international and intergovernmental efforts holds much more promise and potential. The formation of international peacekeeping organisations such as the United Nations (UN) offers the possibility of tackling the threat of terrorism on a war footing, with the expertise and cooperation of nations all around the world. The UN Security Council recently announced a unanimous agreement by all its nations to eliminate terrorism, giving hope to many who have suffered the atrocities of extremist groups. The US, Russia and several countries have joined arms in conducting air raids and drone strikes in the Middle East, destroying vast swathes if terrorist territory as well as their oil source from which they fund their attacks and the organisation itself. The interconnected nature of surveillance technologies across the globe has allowed governments to track movements of potential terrorists, and even predict their attacks using highly sophisticated software so as to prevent them from happening. The sharing of resources and information between governments has granted them power to eradicate threats and nip them in the bud before any harm can be inflicted. The communication and ties between countries help to build rapport and support, providing aid and reinforcements to weaker countries when required. Thus, it is evident that despite the fact that individual governments may be powerless to control such a far-reaching and uncontrollable conflict, the cooperation and unity of governments across the world accrues great power and influence in tackling such problems.
