What the #Wetoo campaign in Japan has shown is the shocking amount of discrimination against women in the Japanese workplace, and how little progress has been made in the country, despite Prime Minister Abe's promises of improving the situation for women in the workplace. This underscores that despite the global and largely liberal trend in support for equality between the genders in creating opportunities for both men and women, limited progress has been made due to the difficulties in changing mindsets and a lack of effective government policies. Despite Abe's claims of being in huge support of women in terms of economic and social empowerment, there remains a significant lack of political representation, with a severe lack of women in his own administration. This points us towards the stagnating and limited improvements of women's rights in the wokrplace as well as politically. 

In the familial sphere as well, women has had to take on an increasing load of burden. With financial empowerment, a hugely uplifting development in the developed world is the increase in the number of working women, not only in fields more traditionally "meant for women", but even in industries dominated by men such as in engineering and the upper echelons in the world of business. However, the huge strides of change in the workplace have not been matched with the public's opinion and views of roles of the husband and wife in the family unit. Mothers are still expected to play the dominant role is housework as well as child-rearing, and even the father's roles in housework stereotypically include gardening or washing the car, which are less routine jobs that take up much less time within a week. The result of this is a disproportionate amount of stress shouldered by working mothers compared to their male partners. This is not only emphasized in families but also propagated in the workplace, where many countries have less or no paternity leave, indicating that the mother is mainly responsible for childcare. With such a double-barrel burden on women, it could be said that the stress placed on working mothers has greatly worsened, due to the failure of people's mindsets and stereotypes to keep pace with the financial empowerment of women.

The situation not only for mothers but also young women has been worsening in the spread of pop culture interspersed with technological developments. The emergence of unhealthy and unrealistic beauty standards as well as the propagation of related online materials via social media has reinforced unhealthy body images among teens, especially young women. This is aggravated by the manipulation of these images using Photoshop to make individuals look skinnier, fairer or blemishless, fostering warped interpretations of beauty among consumers. This is coupled with corporations commercializing and selling beauty to women via diet pills or slimming plans such as London Weight Management. In South Korea, for example, beauty has always been of utmost importance, and this has been reinforced by stick-thin K-pop idols in the industry, leading to cosmetic surgery becoming commonplace among young teens. Moreover, girls increasingly younger have encountered enating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia due to unhealthy mindsets and standards of beauty imposed upon them. Hence, to a large extent, young women are having it worse today than ever, due to the constantly rising pressures of society to meet standards of ideality in physical appearance.
