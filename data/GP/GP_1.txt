Economic migration can bring in capital, knowledge and foreign technology to bolster a country’s capital stock and human capital for increased economic growth. However, a government is obliged to remain committed in protecting the economic interests of the locals to ensure employment and their continued stake in the economy. Foreigners who are economic migrants seek out better employment and a higher standard of living in countries overseas. While these foreigners, such as Bangladeshi and Chinese workers, help to plug manpower shortages in sectors such as construction in countries with small population sizes such as Singapore, the government needs to ensure that the locals continue to have access to employment. The government, being representative of its own citizens, has the obligation to protect their monetary interests in the economic arena. The government has to ensure that the influx of foreigners is carefully controlled and are only allowed into sectors of the economy that are facing manpower shortages as employment opportunities that are not taken up by locals. 

Furthermore, there is also a need for the government to prioritise protecting the environment that the locals live in above the needs of the foreigners to ensure sustainability for future generations. Foreigners entering a foreign land to travel or to seek out economic opportunities are a transient group that do not have a vested commitment in their country of visit. However, for locals, the country they are in is their home and the resources in the country are finite. To ensure sustainability of the environment’s resources to address the future needs and generations of the locals, it is important that a government protects the environment the locals live in. For example, coastal cities and islands in Spain live off visitors into small towns and cities have led to a multitude of social and environmental problems.  The increase in tourists has led to an increase in private hire and rental transport, and illegal parking has become an eyesore, prompting the local administration to ban parking at cathedrals and city squares. 

However, there is also credit to the argument that governments have moral responsibilities to provide humanitarian assistance to foreigners fleeing political persecution in their home countries. As such, the needs of the foreigners are sometimes being placed above the needs of the locals. For example, Syrian refugees fleeing the ongoing political crisis in Syria are seeking refuge in the European continent. There is a moral obligation for European governments to provide sufficient humanitarian assistance to these refugees seeking asylum as deporting them could potentially result in deaths. By closing off their borders to these refugees, the refugees are forced to find pathways to other countries, making the journey in overcrowded flimsy boats that often capsize in choppy seas. As of date, more than 3700 migrants have drowned in capsizing incidents. Some may argue that by accepting these refugees, a considerable amount of strain is placed upon the social welfare system of host countries, who now have to provide food, accommodation and other needs of these foreigners. This may be unfair for locals, who are paying taxes to support such systems.
